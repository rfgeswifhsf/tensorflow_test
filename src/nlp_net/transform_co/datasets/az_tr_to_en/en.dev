when i was 11 , i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to bbc news on his small , gray radio .
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
`` `` '' the taliban are gone ! '' '' my father shouted . ''
i did n't know what it meant , but i could see that my father was very , very happy .
`` `` '' you can go to a real school now , '' '' he said . ''
a morning that i will never forget .
a real school .
you see , i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
so for the next five years , i dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
and my father — that 's him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the taliban , despite the risks .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
during taliban years , i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
`` i would want to quit , but my father , he would say , `` '' listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life . ''
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
`` so do you still not want to continue ? '' '' today i am 22 . ''
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , i would be one of them .
instead , i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college .
( applause ) when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
he not only brags about my college degree , but also that i was the first woman , and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul .
( applause ) my family believes in me .
i dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that 's why i am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
that 's why i cofounded sola , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school .
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
and i see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
like ahmed . that 's not his real name , and i can not show you his face , but ahmed is the father of one of my students .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from sola to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
`` `` '' kill me now , if you wish , '' '' he said , `` '' but i will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas . '' '' what i 've come to realize about afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the west , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success . ''
it 's not to say that our mothers are n't key in our success .
in fact , they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
under the taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan .
( applause ) afghanistan looks so different from here in america .
i find that americans see the fragility in changes .
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the u.s. troops ' withdrawal .
but when i am back in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , i see a promising future and lasting change .
to me , afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that .
like me , they are dreaming big .
thank you .
( applause )
just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
disappears right into the background .
so , he 's bluffing . let 's do it backwards .
one , two , three .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution .
if anything seemed unnatural , i could be imprisoned and repatriated .
even though i was really fortunate to get out , many other north koreans have not been so lucky .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
am i south korean or north korean ?
so i started planning how to help them escape .
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
this is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
we made this kindergarten to be a circle .
it 's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
if you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
this is how the rooftop looks .
and why did we design this ?
`` the principal of this kindergarten said , `` no , i do n't want a handrail . '' ''
`` i said , `` '' it 's impossible . '' '' but he insisted : `` '' how about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ? ''
`` so that it can catch the children falling off ? '' '' ( laughter ) i said , `` '' it 's impossible . '' '' and of course , the government official said , `` of course you have to have a handrail . '' ''
but we could keep that idea around the trees .
there are three trees popping through .
and we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
but of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
they fall into the net .
and you get more , and more , more .
( laughter ) sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
the boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( laughter ) and at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
it looks so nice from underneath .
monkeys in the zoo .
( laughter ) feeding time .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
and if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
and the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
you see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
but if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he 's putting water into his boots .
( laughter ) this kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
and there is no boundary between inside and outside .
so it means basically this architecture is a roof .
and also there is no boundary between classrooms .
so there is no acoustic barrier at all .
when you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
but in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
because there is no boundary .
and the principal says if the boy in the corner does n't want to stay in the room , we let him go .
he will come back eventually , because it 's a circle , it comes back .
( laughter ) but the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
but here , just they leave and come back .
it 's a natural process .
and secondly , we consider noise very important .
you know that children sleep better in noise .
they do n't sleep in a quiet space .
and in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
and you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
they need noise .
and you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
you are not supposed to be in silence .
and you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
you know , it 's completely open .
and you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
in summer you go swimming .
the sand is 50 degrees .
and also , you should know that you are waterproof .
you never melt in rain .
so , children are supposed to be outside .
so that is how we should treat them .
this is how they divide classrooms .
they are supposed to help teachers .
they do n't .
( laughter ) i did n't put him in .
a classroom .
and a washbasin .
they talk to each other around the well .
and there are always some trees in the classroom .
a monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( laughter ) monkeys . ( laughter )
and each classroom has at least one skylight .
and this is where santa claus comes down at the time of christmas .
this is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
the building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
and of course , the ceiling height is very low .
so you have to consider safety .
so , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
they tried to go in .
he hit his head .
he 's okay . his skull is quite strong .
he is resilient . it 's my son .
( laughter ) and he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
and then we put other children .
the traffic jam is awful in tokyo , as you know .
( laughter ) the driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
and in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
this is society . this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30 .
and the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
so it 's not exactly small at all .
and this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
but the surprise is yet to come .
the children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
and these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
`` the principal says , `` '' i do n't train them . we leave them on top of the roof . ''
`` just like sheep . '' '' ( laughter ) they keep running . ( laughter ) ''
my point is do n't control them , do n't protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
they need to get some injury .
and that makes them learn how to live in this world .
i think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people 's lives .
and this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
thank you very much .
( applause )
so i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan , china in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
`` but my tiger mother said , `` '' no . '' '' my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them . ''
after surviving the cultural revolution , they firmly believed there 's only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
it is not important if i like the job or not .
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer .
that is me playing my imaginary piano .
an opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so i tried everything i could to go to opera school .
i even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
but no adults liked the idea .
no adults believed i was serious .
only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as i was .
so at age 15 , i knew i was too old to be trained .
my dream would never come true .
i was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best i could hope for .
but that 's so unfair .
so i was determined to find another calling .
nobody around to teach me ? fine .
i turned to books .
`` i satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . [ `` '' correspondence in the family of fou lei '' '' ] i found my role model of an independent woman when confucian tradition requires obedience . [ `` '' jane eyre '' '' ] and i learned to be efficient from this book . [ `` '' cheaper by the dozen '' '' ] and i was inspired to study abroad after reading these . ''
`` [ `` '' complete works of sanmao '' '' ( aka echo chan ) ] [ `` '' lessons from history '' '' by nan huaijin ] i came to the u.s. in 1995 , so which books did i read here first ? ''
books banned in china , of course .
`` `` '' the good earth '' '' is about chinese peasant life . ''
that 's just not convenient for propaganda . got it .
the bible is interesting , but strange .
( laughter ) that 's a topic for a different day .
`` but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : `` you shall honor your father and mother . '' ''
`` `` '' honor , '' '' i said . `` `` that 's so different , and better , than obey . '' '' so it becomes my tool to climb out of this confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents . ''
encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
it offers many insights .
for example , i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with .
it had never occurred to me , china does n't have to be at the center of the world .
a map actually carries somebody 's view .
comparative reading actually is nothing new .
it 's a standard practice in the academic world .
there are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
so i thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
so i started reading books in pairs .
`` so they can be about people — [ `` '' benjamin franklin '' '' by walter isaacson ] [ `` '' john adams '' '' by david mccullough ] — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences . ''
`` [ `` '' personal history '' '' by katharine graham ] [ `` '' the snowball : warren buffett and the business of life , '' '' by alice schroeder ] i also compare the same stories in different genres — ( laughter ) [ holy bible : king james version ] [ `` '' lamb '' '' by chrisopher moore ] — or similar stories from different cultures , as joseph campbell did in his wonderful book . [ `` '' the power of myth '' '' by joseph campbell ] for example , both the christ and the buddha went through three temptations . ''
for the christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
for the buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
so if you know a foreign language , it 's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
`` [ `` '' the way of chuang tzu '' '' thomas merton ] [ `` '' tao : the watercourse way '' '' alan watts ] instead of lost in translation , i found there is much to gain . ''
`` for example , it 's through translation that i realized `` '' happiness '' '' in chinese literally means `` '' fast joy . '' '' huh ! ''
`` `` '' bride '' '' in chinese literally means `` '' new mother . '' '' uh-oh . ''
( laughter ) books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
even a shattered dream can do that for you .
so because of books , i 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
so may books be always with you .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
you would n't stand for it . you 'd make a stink .
`` you 'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you 'd say , `` '' why my chair ? '' '' okay , so now it 's tuesday morning and you 're at the office , and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar . ''
and i 'm talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
i 'm talking about time . your time .
( laughter ) the primary symptom of mindless accept syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( laughter )
`` it 's an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it 's in your calendar , `` '' got ta go , i 'm already late for a meeting . '' '' ( laughter ) meetings are important , right ? ''
and collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
and a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
and we 're miserable . ( laughter ) and we 're miserable not because the other guy ca n't run a good meeting , it 's because of mas , our mindless accept syndrome , which is a self-inflicted wound .
actually , i have evidence to prove that mas is a global epidemic .
let me tell you why .
a couple of years ago , i put a video on youtube , and in the video , i acted out every terrible conference call you 've ever been on .
it goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
there 's the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
there are the participants who have no idea why they 're there .
and everybody leaves very angry .
it 's kind of funny .
( laughter ) let 's take a quick look .
( video ) our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
hi , it 's joe . i 'm working from home today .
( laughter ) hi , joe . thanks for joining us today , great .
as a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — ( laughter ) hi , who just joined ?
no ? i thought i heard a beep . ( laughter ) sound familiar ?
yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
a couple of weeks after i put that online , 500,000 people in dozens of countries , i mean dozens of countries , watched this video .
and three years later , it 's still getting thousands of views every month .
and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
`` i 'm michael shermer , director of the skeptics society , publisher of `` '' skeptic '' '' magazine . ''
we investigate claims of the paranormal , pseudo-science , fringe groups and cults , and claims of all kinds between , science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , bad science , non-science , and plain old non-sense .
and unless you 've been on mars recently , you know there 's a lot of that out there .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
but let 's face it , there 's a lot of bunk .
we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there — well , we 're sort of like the ralph naders of bad ideas , ( laughter ) trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas .
i 'll show you an example of a bad idea .
i brought this with me , this was given to us by nbc dateline to test .
it 's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .
it 's called the quadro 2000 dowser rod .
( laughter ) this was being sold to high-school administrators for $ 900 apiece .
it 's a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to it .
you could dowse for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students ' lockers .
( laughter ) so the way it works is you go down the hallway , and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker .
so it looks something like this .
i 'll show you .
( laughter ) well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
well , this is science , so we 'll do a controlled experiment .
it 'll go this way for sure .
( laughter ) sir , do you want to empty your pockets , please , sir ? ( laughter )
so the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students ' lockers ?
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
( laughter ) ( applause ) but in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits .
and that 's probably the key lesson to my short talk here : this is how psychics work , astrologers , tarot card readers and so on .
people remember the hits and forget the misses .
in science , we keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you 'd expect by chance .
in this case , we tested it .
we had two opaque boxes : one with government-approved thc marijuana , and one with nothing .
and it got it 50 percent of the time — ( laughter ) which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin-flip model .
so that 's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
`` `` '' skeptic '' '' is the quarterly publication . each one has a particular theme . ''
this one is on the future of intelligence .
are people getting smarter or dumber ?
i have an opinion of this myself because of the business i 'm in , but in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter .
three iq points per 10 years , going up .
sort of an interesting thing .
with science , do n't think of skepticism as a thing , or science as a thing .
are science and religion compatible ?
it 's like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
they 're just two different things .
science is not a thing . it 's a verb .
it 's a way of thinking about things .
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
i mean , what 's more likely : that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in farmer bob 's field in puckerbrush , kansas to promote skeptic.com , our web page ?
`` or is it more likely that a reader of `` '' skeptic '' '' did this with photoshop ? ''
and in all cases we have to ask — ( laughter ) what 's the more likely explanation ?
before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it 's not in this world .
`` what 's more likely : that arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship , or that the `` '' world weekly news '' '' makes stuff up ? ''
( laughter ) the same theme is expressed nicely here in this sidney harris cartoon .
`` for those of you in the back , it says here : `` '' then a miracle occurs . ''
`` i think you need to be more explicit here in step two . '' '' this single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments . ''
there 's nothing more to it than that .
( applause ) you can say a miracle occurs , it 's just that it does n't explain anything or offer anything .
there 's nothing to test .
it 's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
and it 's true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers — dark energy or dark matter , something like that — until we figure out what it is , we 'll call it this .
it 's the beginning of the causal chain for science .
for intelligent design creationists , it 's the end of the chain .
so again , we can ask this : what 's more likely ?
are ufos alien spaceships , or perceptual cognitive mistakes , or even fakes ?
this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena , california , looking down over pasadena .
and if it looks a lot like a buick hubcap , it 's because it is .
you do n't even need photoshop or high-tech equipment , you do n't need computers .
this was shot with a throwaway kodak instamatic camera .
you just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
camera 's ready — that 's it .
( laughter ) so , although it 's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on , and that some of them are real , it 's more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
on a more serious note , in all of science we 're looking for a balance between data and theory .
in the case of galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .
first of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
second of all , his data was grainy and fuzzy , and he could n't quite make out what he was looking at .
`` so he wrote that he had seen — `` i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . '' ''
and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
so without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you ca n't have a good theory .
it was n't solved until 1655 .
this is christiaan huygens 's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with saturn .
it was n't till huygens had two things : he had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated , and he had better telescopic , more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the earth is going around faster — according to kepler 's laws — than saturn , then we catch up with it .
and we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
the problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases .
so one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things , on a simple level , and then i 'll go to more serious ones .
like , we have a tendency to see faces .
this is the face on mars .
in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by martians .
here 's the close-up of it from 2001 .
if you squint , you can still see the face .
and when you 're squinting , you 're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain , so you 're reducing the quality of your data .
and if i did n't tell you what to look for , you 'd still see the face , because we 're programmed by evolution to see faces .
faces are important for us socially .
and of course , happy faces , faces of all kinds are easy to see .
you see the happy face on mars , there .
( laughter ) if astronomers were frogs , perhaps they 'd see kermit the frog .
do you see him there ? little froggy legs .
or if geologists were elephants ?
religious iconography .
( laughter ) discovered by a tennessee baker in 1996 .
he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from mother teresa 's lawyer .
here 's our lady of guadalupe and our lady of watsonville , just down the street , or is it up the street from here ?
tree bark is particularly good because it 's nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking — humans are pattern-seeking animals .
here 's the virgin mary on the side of a glass window in sao paulo .
here 's when the virgin mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich — which i got to actually hold in a las vegas casino — of course , this being america .
( laughter ) this casino paid $ 28,500 on ebay for the cheese sandwich . ( laughter )
but who does it really look like ? the virgin mary ? ( laughter )
it has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look .
virgin mary in clearwater , florida .
i actually went to see this one .
there was a lot of people there .
the faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches , and so on .
we went down and investigated .
just to give you a size , that 's dawkins , me and the amazing randi , next to this two , two and a half story-sized image .
all these candles , thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this .
so we walked around the backside , to see what was going on .
it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
here 's the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
i guess you can only have one miracle per building .
( laughter ) so is it really a miracle of mary , or is it a miracle of marge ? ( laughter )
and now i 'm going to finish up with another example of this , with auditory illusions .
`` there 's this film , `` '' white noise , '' '' with michael keaton , about the dead talking back to us . ''
by the way , the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal .
anybody can do it , turns out .
it 's getting the dead to talk back that 's the really hard part .
( laughter ) in this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena .
there 's a reversespeech.com web page where i downloaded this stuff .
this is the most famous one of all of these .
here 's the forward version of the very famous song .
( music with lyrics ) if there 's a bustle in your hedgerow do n't be alarmed now .
it 's just a spring clean for the may queen .
yes , there are two paths you can go by , but in the long run , there 's still time to change the road you 're on .
all right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there .
( music with unintelligible lyrics ) ( lyrics ) satan !
( unintelligible lyrics continue ) what did you get ? audience : satan !
`` satan . ok , at least we got `` '' satan '' '' . ''
now , i 'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear , and then hear it again .
i 'm going to just end with a positive , nice little story .
the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization .
we 're always looking for little good things that people do .
and in england , there 's a pop singer .
one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
and she wrote a beautiful song .
`` it was in the top five in 2005 , called , `` '' nine million bicycles in beijing . '' '' it 's a love story — she 's sort of the norah jones of the uk — about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth . ''
and she has this one passage here .
( music ) ( lyrics ) we are 12 billion light-years from the edge that 's a guess , no one can ever say it 's true , but i know that i will always be with you .
michael shermer : well , that 's nice . at least she got it close .
`` in america it 'd be , `` '' we 're 6,000 light years from the edge . '' '' ( laughter ) but my friend , simon singh , the particle physicist now turned science educator , who wrote the book `` '' the big bang , '' '' and so on , uses every chance he gets to promote good science . ''
`` and so he wrote an op-ed piece in `` '' the guardian '' '' about katie 's song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how far from the edge . ''
you know , it 's 13.7 billion light years , and it 's not a guess .
we know within precise error bars how close it is .
so we can say , although not absolutely true , it 's pretty close to being true .
`` and , to his credit , katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out , and said , `` '' i 'm so embarrassed . i was in the astronomy club . ''
`` i should 've known better . '' '' and she re-cut the song . ''
so i will end with the new version .
( music with lyrics ) we are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe .
that 's a good estimate with well-defined error bars .
and with the available information , i predict that i will always be with you .
( laughter ) how cool is that ?
( applause )
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west could n't understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what 's really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
like here , we have mr. dimitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
here 's vladimir tsastsin form tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this is stephen watt .
this is bjorn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and i claim it 's already today that it 's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
they 're motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
diginotar is a certificate authority from the netherlands — or actually , it was .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
well diginotar is a c.a .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , ssl encrypted services , services like gmail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government ca n't snoop on their discussions .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
and issue rogue certificates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
well in egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
`` among those papers , was this binder entitled `` '' finfisher . '' '' and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country . ''
they had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company headquarters are right here .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state trojan was found , which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it 's pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
`` now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , `` '' okay , that sounds bad , but that does n't really affect me because i 'm a legal citizen . ''
why should i worry ?
`` because i have nothing to hide . '' '' and this is an argument , which does n't make sense . ''
privacy is implied .
privacy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
it 's a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you for being here .
`` and i say `` '' thank you for being here '' '' because i was silent for 17 years . ''
and the first words that i spoke were in washington , d.c. , on the 20th anniversary of earth day .
and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
`` and i said , `` '' thank you for being here . '' '' my mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , `` hallelujah , johnny’s talking ! '' ''
( laughter ) imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
`` my dad said to me , `` '' that’s one '' '' — i’ll explain that . ''
but i turned around because i didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from .
`` i hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years , so i turned around and i looked and i said , `` god , who 's saying what i’m thinking ? '' ''
and then i realized it was me , you know , and i kind of laughed .
`` and i could see my father : `` '' yeah , he really is crazy . '' '' well , i want to take you on this journey . ''
and the journey , i believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
even though this one is kind of unusual , i want you to think about your own journey .
my journey began in 1971 when i witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the golden gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
that’s a big thing in california .
and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness , california , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now .
and so when i came in and i started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
`` and people would drive up next to me and say , `` '' john , what are you doing ? '' '' and i’d say , `` '' well , i’m walking for the environment . '' '' and they said , `` '' no , you’re walking to make us look bad , right ? ''
`` you’re walking to make us feel bad . '' '' and maybe there was some truth to that , because i thought that if i started walking , everyone would follow . ''
because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
and so i argued with people about that , i argued and i argued .
i called my parents up .
`` i said , `` '' i’ve given up riding and driving in cars . '' '' my dad said , `` '' why didn’t you do that when you were 16 ? '' '' ( laughter ) i didn’t know about the environment then . ''
they’re back in philadelphia .
`` and so i told my mother , `` '' i’m happy though , i’m really happy . '' '' she said , `` '' if you were happy , son , you wouldn’t have to say it . '' '' mothers are like that . ''
and so , on my 27th birthday i decided , because i argued so much and i talk so much , that i was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
and so i did .
i got up in the morning and i didn’t say a word .
and i have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , i began listening — in a long time .
and what i heard , it kind of disturbed me .
because what i used to do , when i thought i was listening , was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could — i knew what they were going to say , and so i stopped listening .
and in my mind , i just kind of raced ahead and thought of what i was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
and then i would launch in .
well , that just ended communication .
so on this first day i actually listened .
and it was very sad for me , because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning .
i was 27. i thought i knew everything .
i didn’t .
and so i decided i’d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more and i needed to learn more .
so for a year i said i would keep quiet , and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again .
well , that lasted 17 years .
now during that time — those 17 years — i walked and i played the banjo and i painted and i wrote in my journal , and i tried to study the environment by reading books .
and i decided that i was going to go to school . so i did .
i walked up to ashland , oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
it’s only 500 miles .
`` and i went into the registrar’s office and — `` what , what , what ? '' ''
i had a newspaper clipping .
`` `` '' oh , so you really want to go to school here ? ''
you don’t … ?
`` we have a special program for you . '' '' they did . ''
and in those two years , i graduated with my first degree — a bachelor’s degree .
and my father came out , he was so proud .
`` he said , `` '' listen , we’re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree ? ''
`` you don’t ride in cars , you don’t talk — you’re going to have to do those things . '' '' ( laughter ) i hunched my shoulder , i picked my backpack up again and i started walking . ''
i walked all the way up to port townsend , washington , where i built a wooden boat , rode it across puget sound and walked across washington [ to ] idaho and down to missoula , montana .
i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i 'd like to go to school there .
i said i 'd be there in about two years .
( laughter ) and i was there . i showed up in two years and they — i tell this story because they really helped me .
there are two stories in montana .
the first story is i didn’t have any money — that’s a sign i used a lot .
`` and they said , '' '' do n't worry about that . '' '' the director of the program said , `` '' come back tomorrow . '' '' he gave me 150 dollars , and he said , `` '' register for one credit . ''
`` you’re going to go to south america , aren’t you ? '' '' and i said — rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , south america . ''
so i did that .
`` he came back ; he said to me , `` '' ok john , now that you 've registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you’re matriculating , so you can use the library . ''
and what we’re going to do is , we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
`` they’re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade . '' '' wow , they don’t do that in graduate schools , i don’t think . ''
but i use that story because they really wanted to help me .
they saw that i was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
and during that time , i actually taught classes without speaking .
i had 13 students when i first walked into the class .
i explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that i was john francis , i was walking around the world , i didn’t talk and this was the last time this person’s going to be here interpreting for me .
all the students sat around and they went ...
( laughter ) i could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
they had to take that class with me .
two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
and i learned in that class — because i would do things like this ...
`` and they were all gathered around , going , `` '' what 's he trying to say ? '' '' `` i do n't know , i think he 's talking about clear cutting . '' `` yeah , clear cutting . '' ''
`` `` no , no , no , that 's not clear cutting , that’s — he 's using a handsaw . '' ''
`` `` well , you can’t clearcut with a ... '' ''
`` `` yes , you can clear cut ... '' ''
`` `` no , i think he’s talking about selective forestry . '' ''
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
i just backed out of that , you know , and i just kind of kept the fists from flying .
but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and they said things that i absolutely did not mean , but i should have .
and so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren’t learning you probably weren’t teaching very well .
and so i went on .
`` my dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , i did the deal , and my father said , `` '' we’re really proud of you son , but ... `` '' you know what went on , he said , `` '' you’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking . ''
`` what are you going to do with a master’s degree ? '' '' i hunched my shoulder , i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin . ''
i spent two years there writing on oil spills .
no one was interested in oil spills .
but something happened — exxon valdez .
and i was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills .
my dad came out again .
`` he said , `` '' i do n't know how you do this , son — i mean , you do n't ride in cars , you don’t talk . ''
`` my sister said maybe i should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you’re not saying anything . '' '' ( laughter ) well , i put on my backpack again . ''
i put my banjo on and i walked all the way to the east coast , put my foot in the atlantic ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the united states .
and on earth day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of earth day — that’s when i began to speak .
`` and that’s why i said , `` '' thank you for being here . '' '' because it 's sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there 's no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ? ''
and i’m thanking you , and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
and that’s communication .
and they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
and it’s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
well , my journey kept going on .
`` my dad said , `` '' that’s one , '' '' and i still didn’t let that go . ''
i worked for the coastguard , was made a u.n. goodwill ambassador .
i wrote regulations for the united states — i mean , i wrote oil spill regulations .
`` 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , `` john , do you really want to make a difference ? '' ''
`` `` yeah , i want to make a difference . '' ''
`` he said , `` '' you just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . '' '' and as i walked off a little bit , they 'd say , `` '' yeah , and shut up , too . '' '' ( laughter ) `` you’re going to make a difference , buddy . '' ''
how could that be , how could that be ?
how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
well , my time at the coast guard was a really good time .
`` and after that — i only worked one year — i said , `` '' that 's enough . one year 's enough for me to do that . '' '' i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to venezuela . ''
and you know , i forgot the most important thing , which is why i started talking , which i have to tell you .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
i’d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
and the informal level — i learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
and environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
and so that’s the message that i had .
`` and i said , `` '' well , i 'm going to have to spread that message . '' '' and i got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the caribbean — it was n't really my sailboat , i kind of worked on that boat — got to venezuela and i started walking . ''
this is the last part of this story , because it’s how i got here , because i still did n't ride in motorized vehicles .
i was walking through el dorado — it 's a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in venezuela , and i don’t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
`` there i am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , `` '' pasaporte , pasaporte , '' '' and with an m16 pointed at me . ''
`` and i looked at him and i said , `` '' passport , huh ? ''
i do n't need to show you my passport . it’s in the back of my pack .
`` i 'm dr. francis ; i 'm a u.n. ambassador and i 'm walking around the world . '' '' and i started walking off . ''
what possessed me to say this thing ?
the road turned into the jungle .
i didn’t get shot .
`` and i got to — i start saying , `` '' free at last — thank god almighty , i’m free at last . '' '' `` `` what was that about , '' '' i’m saying . what was that about ? ''
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
i was a prisoner and i needed to escape .
the prison that i was in was the fact that i did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
now how could that be ?
because when i started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
but the thing that was different was that every birthday , i asked myself about silence , but i never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
i had no idea i was going to become a u.n. ambassador .
i had no idea i would have a ph.d .
and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me , and that i was going to have to change .
you know , we can do it .
i was going to have to change .
and i was afraid to change , because i was so used to the guy who only just walked .
i was so used to that person that i didn’t want to stop .
i didn’t know who i would be if i changed .
but i know i needed to .
i know i needed to change , because it would be the only way that i could be here today .
and i know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to , but there’s another place for us to go .
and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
and so , i want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
we have to change now .
as our former vice president said , we have to become activists .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
and i know that all of you have touched me while i’ve been here .
so , let’s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we’ve shown each other right here at ted , and take this out into the world .
because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we’re going to treat the environment .
so i want to thank you for being here and i want to end this in five seconds of silence .
thank you .
( applause )
`` so , imagine you 're standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , `` excuse me , what is the name of this block ? '' ''
`` and you say , `` '' i 'm sorry , well , this is oak street , that 's elm street . ''
`` this is 26th , that 's 27th . '' '' he says , `` '' ok , but what is the name of that block ? '' '' you say , `` '' well , blocks do n't have names . ''
`` streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . '' '' he leaves , a little confused and disappointed . ''
`` so , now imagine you 're standing on a street , anywhere in japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , `` excuse me , what is the name of this street ? '' ''
`` they say , `` '' oh , well that 's block 17 and this is block 16 . '' '' and you say , `` '' ok , but what is the name of this street ? '' '' and they say , `` '' well , streets do n't have names . ''
blocks have names .
just look at google maps here . there 's block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
all of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
`` and you say then , `` '' ok , then how do you know your home address ? '' '' he said , `` '' well , easy , this is district eight . ''
`` there 's block 17 , house number one . '' '' you say , `` '' ok , but walking around the neighborhood , i noticed that the house numbers do n't go in order . '' '' he says , `` '' of course they do . they go in the order in which they were built . ''
the first house ever built on a block is house number one .
the second house ever built is house number two .
`` third is house number three . it 's easy . it 's obvious . '' '' so , i love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we did n't even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true . ''
so , for example , there are doctors in china who believe that it 's their job to keep you healthy .
so , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you 're sick you do n't have to pay them because they failed at their job . they get rich when you 're healthy , not sick .
`` ( applause ) in most music , we think of the `` '' one '' '' as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four . ''
`` but in west african music , the `` '' one '' '' is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence . ''
so , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
and this map is also accurate .
( laughter ) there 's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about india , the opposite is also true .
so , let 's never forget , whether at ted , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
