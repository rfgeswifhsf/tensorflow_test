( arabic ) i seek refuge in allah from cursed satan . in the name of allah , the most gracious , the most merciful .
( english ) i was born in a middle class family .
so i guess i was the lucky one .
my mother had 16 pregnancies .
from 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
you can imagine as a child what i went through .
day to day , i watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
i wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
unfortunately , in my country , there was n't a dormitory for girls , so i was accepted in medical school , but i could not go there .
so as a result , my father sent me to america .
i came to america .
i completed my education .
while i was completing my education , my country was invaded by russia .
and do you know that at the time i was completing my education , i did n't know what was going on with my family or with my country .
there were months , years , i did n't know about it .
my family was in a refugee camp .
so as soon as i completed my education , i brought my family to america .
i wanted them to be safe .
but where was my heart ?
my heart was in afghanistan .
i had a good job .
i was a professor at a university .
so i went to the refugee camp .
and when i went to the refugee camp in pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
about 90 percent of them were women and children . most of the men have been killed or they were in war . and you know , in the refugee camp ,
when i went day-to-day to do a survey , i found things you never could imagine .
i saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do .
i saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
so it was a very devastating situation .
at that moment , we talk about momentum .
at that moment , i felt , what can i do for these people ?
how could i help these people ?
but at that moment , i knew that education changed my life .
it transformed me . it gave me status .
and i knew that at that moment that what i should give to my people is education and health , and that 's what i went after .
but do you think it was easy ?
no , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
`` it was very hard to come and say , `` '' i want to do this . '' '' who am i ? ''
did they trust me ? of course not .
so i really needed to build the trust in this community .
how am i going to do that ?
i went and surveyed and looked and looked .
i asked .
he was 80 years old .
he was a mullah .
`` and he looked at me , and he said , `` '' crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think i can be a teacher ? '' '' and i told him , `` '' i will make you a teacher . '' '' finally , he accepted my offer , and once i started a class in his compound , the word spread all over . ''
in a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
but of course , we 're doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . we were training women 's rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . we were giving all kinds of training . and one day , i tell you ,
one day i was in the office in peshawar , pakistan .
`` all of a sudden , i saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , `` '' run away , hide ! '' '' and you know , as a leader , what do you do ? ''
you 're scared . you know it 's dangerous .
you know your life is on the line .
but as a leader , you have to hold it together .
you have to hold it together and show strength .
so i invited them to the office .
they came , and there were nine of them — nine taliban .
and i invited them to have a seat and have tea .
they said no . they are not going to drink tea .
and of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but i was really shaking up .
but also i was strong , holding myself up .
`` they asked me , `` '' what are you doing ? ''
by that time , my staff poured into my office .
we continuously opened clinics .
we worked with mothers and children .
we had reproductive health training .
we had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
i was very happy . i was delighted with the outcome of my work .
and one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , i was going up north of kabul , and all of a sudden , again , i was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
rifles on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
this time , we all are going to be killed .
we know where you are going .
they ran away home . nobody stayed there .
my bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
so i was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
`` and she asked me , `` '' sakena ? '' '' and i answered her . ''
today , they are the best trainers .
and — ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
that tells you that education transforms people .
i live in a country that was a beautiful country .
i just want to share this with you .
we were going everywhere .
but you know what happened to my country .
today , people can not walk out of their door without security issues .
but we want the same afghanistan we had before .
they are earning degrees . they are training to be lawyers .
he said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .

( applause ) maya penn : i 've been drawing ever since i could hold a crayon , and i 've been making animated flip books since i was three years old .
at that age , i also learned about what an animator was .
there was a program on tv about jobs most kids do n't know about .
`` when i understood that an animator makes the cartoons i saw on tv , i immediately said , `` '' that 's what i want to be . '' '' i do n't know if i said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life . ''
animation and art has always been my first love .
`` it was my love for technology that sparked the idea for `` '' malicious dishes . '' '' there was a virus on my computer , and i was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , i just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ? ''
maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
`` and thus , `` '' malicious dishes '' '' was born . ''
at four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
that started my love for technology .
i built my first website myself in html , and i 'm learning javascript and python .
`` i 'm also working on an animated series called `` '' the pollinators . '' '' it 's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they 're so important . ''
if plants are n't pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
so i decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
( applause ) ( foot stomp ) ( music ) ( roar ) pollinator : deforestsaurus ! i should have known !
i need to call on the rest of the pollinators !
( music ) thank you . ( applause ) all of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
ideas can spark a movement .
ideas are opportunities and innovation .
ideas truly are what make the world go round .
if it was n't for ideas , we would n't be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
at eight years old , i took my ideas and started my own business called maya 's ideas , and my nonprofit , maya 's ideas for the planet .
( laughter ) and i make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
i 'm 13 now , and although i started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
i was greatly influenced by art , and i wanted to incorporate it in everything i did , even my business .
`` i would find different fabrics around the house , and say , `` '' this could be a scarf or a hat , '' '' and i had all these ideas for designs . ''
`` i noticed when i wore my creations , people would stop me and say , `` wow , that 's really cute . where can i get one ? '' ''
and i thought , i can start my own business .
now i did n't have any business plans at only eight years old .
i only knew i wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and i wanted to give back .
my mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , i would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon , and i would write down the names and the price of each item .
i started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
soon , my items began selling all over the world , and i had customers in denmark , italy , australia , canada and more .
now , i had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
soon , my business really started to take off .
then one day , forbes magazine contacted me when i was 10 years old .
( laughter ) they wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
i 've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since i was little .
my parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
i heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so i started doing my own research , and i discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
for example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
these actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
so when i started my business , i knew two things : all of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits i made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
( applause ) i feel i 'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
i feel that i can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
we live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
but it 's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
it takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
that is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
thank you , and peace and blessings .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) pat mitchell : so , you heard maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . where are they ?
please , mr. and mrs. penn . would you just — ah !
( applause )
here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
they 're exactly what they sound like .
they are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
so most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
now , by showing you some of these images , i hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , i think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they 're useful .
useful as the universe 's most massive laboratories .
and as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and i think there are four major types , and the first type that i want to describe is probing the very big .
so , how big ?
well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it 's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
it 's just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
but more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
they are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
and many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
so that was very big .
the second things is very hot .
okay , if i take an image of a galaxy cluster , and i subtract away all of the starlight , what i 'm left with is this big , blue blob .
this is in false color .
it 's actually x-ray light that we 're seeing .
and the question is , if it 's not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
the answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it 's plasma .
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
the extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
so this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
there are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
third thing : probing the very small .
now , to explain this , i need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
most of the universe 's matter is not made up of atoms .
you were lied to .
most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
dark matter is something that does n't like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
if you 're a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
and dark matter is no exception .
well , how do we do this ?
to answer that question , i 'm going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
here is an image .
since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
they are mostly made up of dark matter , and that 's what you see in this bluish purple .
the red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
what 's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
and this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
so , it 's very funny .
the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
certainly what i 've said so far is crazy .
okay , if there 's anything stranger i think it has to be dark energy .
if i throw a ball into the air , i expect it to go up .
what i do n't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
they do n't understand why it 's expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
they give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
so , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it 's horribly complicated .
here is a computer simulation .
and we need a way to simplify it .
well , i like to think about this using an analogy .
if i want to understand the sinking of the titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
similarly , i can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
so , as i come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
i mean , i began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and i 've given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
well , to answer this , i want to give you a quote by henry ford when he was asked about cars .
`` he had this to say : `` '' if i had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . '' '' today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems . ''
and the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
they are not faster horses .
they will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
so , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
and i ca n't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . thanks .

`` so , imagine you 're standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , `` excuse me , what is the name of this block ? '' ''
`` and you say , `` '' i 'm sorry , well , this is oak street , that 's elm street . ''
`` this is 26th , that 's 27th . '' '' he says , `` '' ok , but what is the name of that block ? '' '' you say , `` '' well , blocks do n't have names . ''
`` streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . '' '' he leaves , a little confused and disappointed . ''
`` so , now imagine you 're standing on a street , anywhere in japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , `` excuse me , what is the name of this street ? '' ''
`` they say , `` '' oh , well that 's block 17 and this is block 16 . '' '' and you say , `` '' ok , but what is the name of this street ? '' '' and they say , `` '' well , streets do n't have names . ''
blocks have names .
just look at google maps here . there 's block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
all of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
`` and you say then , `` '' ok , then how do you know your home address ? '' '' he said , `` '' well , easy , this is district eight . ''
`` there 's block 17 , house number one . '' '' you say , `` '' ok , but walking around the neighborhood , i noticed that the house numbers do n't go in order . '' '' he says , `` '' of course they do . they go in the order in which they were built . ''
the first house ever built on a block is house number one .
the second house ever built is house number two .
`` third is house number three . it 's easy . it 's obvious . '' '' so , i love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we did n't even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true . ''
so , for example , there are doctors in china who believe that it 's their job to keep you healthy .
so , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you 're sick you do n't have to pay them because they failed at their job . they get rich when you 're healthy , not sick .
`` ( applause ) in most music , we think of the `` '' one '' '' as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four . ''
`` but in west african music , the `` '' one '' '' is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence . ''
so , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
and this map is also accurate .
( laughter ) there 's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about india , the opposite is also true .
so , let 's never forget , whether at ted , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
