there is trade , there is disarmament , there is cross-border relations .
the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
the west , as i would see it , comes out of that decade weakened , because we did n't understand the group .
everybody seems to agree with that .
social groups are taking to the streets .
because we never talk to the people in these countries .
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
but talking can be done in different ways .
and if we can not demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side .
`` it 's their right to fight . '' '' now as you know , mandela did n't do that . ''
and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
if we 're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts , if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplomats can not be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations .
sometimes you have to .
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
but i also see lots of poverty , and it 's quite jarring , both in the scale and the scope of it .
and i 'm not the first person to ask this question .
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
so that 's why i took a bit of time to study coke .
they take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
they have this very continuous feedback loop .
in tanzania and uganda , they represent 90 percent of coke 's sales .
now , think about how this can change people 's lives .
health extension workers can help with so many things , whether it 's family planning , prenatal care , immunizations for the children , or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery .
in ethiopia , there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program .
now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow .
`` let 's listen to this song that coke created for it , `` '' wavin ' flag '' '' by a somali hip hop artist . ''
so how does health and development market ?
well , it 's based on avoidance , not aspirations .
`` it does n't sound anything like `` '' wavin ' flag '' '' to me . ''
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation .
( laughter ) but what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea ?
now it could have come from one of two places .
to me , that is deep happiness .
( laughter ) that 's reassuring .
it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community .
it was half as long .
that 's 3.2 billion people .
over the last hundred years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way , and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that .
i think there 's — i do n't know what data would impress you , but how about , 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states .
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air , and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices , particularly sitting in cities .
the 20 largest cities in the world .
we 're a recreational vehicle that does n't really matter , and i do n't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .
or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle .
you do it in your sneakers .
we do n't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world .
we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it’s the most exciting job i’ve ever had .
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
but we’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether i’m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
in a newtonian universe , there’s no center — thank you .
of who else there is , of the history and so forth .
and this network of relations is ever-evolving .
so we call it a relational universe .
there must be mechanisms of self-organization inside the universe that make things .
because there’s no place to put a maker outside , as there was in the aristotelian and the newtonian universe .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
and i also think that science will never go away and — i’m finishing on this line .
streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has , and yet it 's an asset that 's largely hidden in plain sight .
when we started out , we did some early surveys about how our streets were used , and we found that new york city was largely a city without seats .
and so we did a six-month pilot .
it was n't about that we 'd closed broadway to cars .
it was about those lawn chairs .
`` `` what did you think about the lawn chairs ? '' ''
this is in front of macy 's , and they were a big supporter of this new approach , because they understood that more people on foot is better for business .
all told , we 've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city .
we 've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space .
we also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program , and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in new york .
bike volumes have spiked .
injuries to all users , pedestrians , cyclists , drivers , are all down 50 percent .
this summer , we launched citi bike , the largest bike share program in the united states , with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another .
people have ridden seven million miles .
what we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon .
and what 's important about that is that , on our planet , on earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life .
so what we 're saying , essentially , is maybe that 's a habitat for life in the solar system .
it 's actually an ice moon .
this is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first christmas eve , december 24th , 1968 , when i was about eight months old .
what 's also not often said about the space exploration , about the apollo program , is the economic contribution it made .
and it showed that for every $ 1 spent on apollo , 14 came back into the u.s. economy .
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , i think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
so exploration can pay for itself .
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
so that star is also 50 million light years away .
and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars .
`` this is a beautiful quote that i found — we 're talking about serendipity there — from alexander fleming : `` '' when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly did n't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic . '' '' now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor . ''
and they certainly did n't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe .
it can be beautiful . it can reveal quite astonishing things .
and if i blow it up there , you see it .
that 's here . that 's home . that 's us .
i think he 's going to be super popular .
we 've got the robot — in his head is a database of a lot of jokes .
and also i can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions .
some of you in this middle section — you have red/green paddles .
`` the bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live . '' '' `` `` that 's terrible , '' '' said the patient . ''
( laughter ) that 's all for now .
thank you .
boo hewerdine , thomas dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . it 's been a blessing singing for you .
very interesting .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
i 'm saying , where do they go when they 're like me ?
you remember all that oil ?
because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission .
does he look like he 's happy ?
but we had problems with it . we had severe problems there .
so what we going to do now ?
we had to do these for adults . so , we did succeed and we still do .
that 's what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply did n't work .
`` let 's go set up a company that teaches people , educates them , gives them the tools they need to keep going . '' '' and that 's a perfect example of one . ''
and guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . then you can customize it .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
you have to do it . africans have to do it , in conjunction with everyone else .
when i became interested in these questions about 10 years ago , scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of .
if all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes , larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains , and the larger the brain , the more cognitively able its owner should be .
maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain .
but nobody did .
well , what about our brain then ?
because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically , we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain .
and all of you are primates .
well , other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs , and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of , we could do the math .
they just ca n't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons .
when you eat like a primate , you ca n't afford both .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
what about us ?
so because of cooking , what once was a major liability , this large , dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons , could now become a major asset , now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that 's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
he was struggling to explain something to me : a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter .
now a laser is different .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
in fact , the ideal may be to use no words at all .
but do n't take my word for it .
they do it by changing their shape .
now that assumes half-hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of 35,000 dollars , and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time , and given that there are some apparently 30 million powerpoint presentations created every day , that would indeed add up to an annual waste of 100 billion dollars .
of course , that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations .
our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money .
that is not enough .
here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes .
i can take a bmw when i 'm seeing clients .
it 's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you could n't have .
so , how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
so , without these wireless technologies , this , as a concept , could never happen .
those are the types of things that you will look at and feel .
and the social benefits : the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is , i told you , 75 percent ; i think we can get that down to 50 percent .
the demand for parking , of course , is down , congestion and the co2 emissions .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people 's willingness to reduce their driving behavior .
and what congestion pricing is is that it 's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing .
and road pricing is where we 're all going to have to go , because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .
when are we going to do it ? are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years ?
`` `` i want to say one word to you , just one word . '' ''
so , the examples that i gave you are these islands of mesh networks , and networks are interesting only as they are big .
this time you will still play the handsome young thing , but i 'll be the sexy woman .
and if i had my druthers , we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .
`` we are — in the words of ted hughes , `` i think that we are like two feet . we need each other to get ahead . '' ''
we sit around it and it shapes our minds .
now we 'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe — a sonic composition .
they destroy stars around them .
they churn up debris in their surroundings .
it 's actually not massive enough .
but basically that 's what we 're talking about .
so you ca n't hide anything behind a black hole .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
so now we 're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
at the end of their lives , they 're going around each other very near the speed of light .
so they 're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
this is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
luckily we 're at this safe distance in long beach , california .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
here 's my multiverse creatures .
thank you . thank you .
the one i 'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means .
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear .
it is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them .
i was thinking about the recent ongoings in congress , where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the start vote .
in global terms , it 's a little bit of money .
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections .
but it 's not just iconic women like shirin , like aung sun suu kyi , like wangari maathai — it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world .
she also received the peace prize .
and after a few months i was writing songs .
`` and they 're like , `` '' what 's that girl doing ? '' '' and then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story . ''
`` they all come up and they 're like , `` '' you know , my aunt 's sister 's babysitter 's dog 's chicken went to china and adopted a girl . '' '' and i tell you what , it like everybody 's got a story . ''
i want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone .
and i know u.s.-china relations does n't need another lawyer .
( applause )
people change us . nothing is secure .
you 're an indian , egyptian , italian , american .
your days become devoted to protecting yourself .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that 's right next to this world .
these warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them does n't happen to anyone else .
their own personal security is not their end goal , and because of that , because , rather than worrying about security , because the transformation of suffering is their end goal , i actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security .
and through their work over the last years , this is not only happening that this house is opening , but it 's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it .
she made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard , but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls .
for eight years , she walked through the rift valley .
she had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman 's body in it , a half a torso , and she would teach people , everywhere she went , what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like .
so , we said , what else could we do ?
when she began her mission eight years ago , she was reviled , she was detested , she was completely slandered in her community .
not running from loss , but entering grief , surrendering to sorrow .
something happened when i began traveling in v-day , eight years ago . i got lost .
i remember being on a plane going from kenya to south africa , and i had no idea where i was .
in the shared future , it will be just that , shared .
how does it impact your ability to work , or envision a future , or thrive , as opposed to just survive ? what i believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women , it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself .
this young girl and her friend that i met in an orphanage in delhi were hiv positive from a syringe .
and the injection is so valuable , that the people basically trust the doctor , being second to god , which i 've heard many times , to do the right thing . but in fact they 're not .
they are lucky . they already have a job .
so recycling and reuse are the major issues here .
( applause ) and it costs the same as a normal syringe .
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating .
is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance ?
when so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes — honor , religion , nationality — what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
`` but you 're young , you could still try again . '' '' my sense of outrage about women 's rights was brought to a boil when i was about 11 . ''
they took off her colorful sari .
was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion ?
she is also immensely pragmatic .
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran , then a math class , then an english class , then computer classes .
the world leymah gbowee was given was a world at war .
leymah was not an activist , she was a mother of three .
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .
she promised to raise the issue with her community .
as the senior officer approaches with a baton , leymah stands up with deliberation , reaches her arms up over her head , and begins , very slowly , to untie her headdress that covers her hair .
and the next thing you know , the police have disappeared .
`` if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to , the man 's family is cursed . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) she said , `` '' i do n't know if he did it because he believed , but he knew we were not going to leave . ''
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf , a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years .
`` a filipina activist once said to me , `` '' how do you cook a rice cake ? ''
that 's the heat from the bottom .
and in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men .
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations .
and they need allies from their communities .
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou , and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers .
it is in these little stories , these individual stories , that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world .
thank you .
well , normally , a charity starts with the cause , and someone that is directly affected by a cause .
and we thought , you know what , there 's nothing for men 's health .
`` but there was nothing for this cause , so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer , and then we created our tagline , which is , `` changing the face of men 's health . '' ''
so with that model , i then cold-called the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation .
so we 'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars worth of debt . so if movember 2006 did n't happen , the four founders , well , we would 've been broke , we would 've been homeless , sitting on the street with mustaches . ( laughter ) but we thought , you know what , if that 's the worst thing that happens , so what ?
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
`` so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , `` '' i have this most amazing concept . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' it 's going to transform your organization . i do n't want to tell you about it now , but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto ? '' '' so i flew here , met down on front street east , and we sat in the boardroom , and i said , `` '' right , here 's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization . '' '' and he looked at me and laughed and said , `` '' adam , sounds like a really novel idea , but we 're ''
so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
and i 'm robbie , and i 'm 14 , and i play the fiddle .
there are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home .
all of these books are well-intentioned .
their marital satisfaction is lower .
i have been looking at what underlies these data for three years , and children are not the problem .
we have no clue what portion our wisdom , if any , is of use to our kids .
we sign them up for team sports , thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills , you know , for when they go to harvard business school .
i hold down a steady job .
`` according to the american time use survey , mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers , which is better than it was in erma bombeck 's day , but i still think that something she wrote is highly relevant : `` i have not been alone in the bathroom since october . '' ''
( laughter ) but here is the thing : men are doing plenty .
that is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless .
there 's no curriculum for it .
but the thing that stuck with me is she said that she did n't know whether oscar the grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive .
thank you .
`` and it deploys legs — it looks almost like `` '' star wars '' '' — when it lands , it absorbs the shock and starts walking . ''
the one in front , the smaller , is strider ii .
so , this is climber .
once it stabilizes that , it lifts a foot , and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing .
or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward . it 's called chimera .
and it can actually crush an empty soda can .
but the cool part is the user interface .
this was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary .
( laughter ) so , based on that success , the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .
and thus , darwin i was born in 2005 .
you 're going to see the action , three against three , completely autonomous .
so , what is the secret of our success ?
so , i see this , scribble everything down , draw things , and i go to bed .
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
at our lab romela , the robotics and mechanisms laboratory , we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions .
so , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up .
batman , fighting against bad guys , he has his utility belt , he has his grappling hook , he has all different kinds of gadgets .
for us roboticists , engineers and scientists , these tools , these are the courses and classes you take in class .
math , differential equations .
also , it 's not about that , only about that . you also have to work really , really hard .
`` so , i always tell my students , `` work smart , then work hard . '' ''
( applause )
we 're going to share a lot of secrets today , you and i , and in doing so , i hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex .
`` if i had known it was you , i would never have said those things . '' '' ( laughter ) i was n't a person to him until i was his professor . ''
this concept , called objectification , is the foundation of sexism , and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives .
we see it in advertisements .
we reduce them to childlike qualities .
most of the responses were negative .
`` `` uncomfortable . '' ''
not exactly .
this theory was later revised , though , when scholars noted the sculptor 's obvious focus on the figurine 's reproductive features : large breasts , considered ideal for nursing ; a round , possibly pregnant belly ; the remnants of red dye , alluding to menstruation or birth .
they also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down because her tiny feet do n't allow her to be freestanding .
she also had no face .
for this reason , it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a portrait of a person .
in the history of her interpretation , she went from object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction .
a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary , because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself .
( applause ) that is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal .
( applause ) this includes not treating pregnant women like community property .
this also includes understanding that even if you are personally against abortion , you can still fight for a woman 's right to choose .
when it comes to women 's equality , the two need not oppose one another .
when you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show , you become a solver , and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos , the chaos of , say , a black-and-white puzzle grid , a mixed-up bag of scrabble tiles , or a shuffled pack of playing cards .
but many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well .
it 's an eternal quest .
gwen : cobalt . david kwong : cobalt , yes . cobalt .
and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap . is n't this fun ?
okay , good .
okay , great . so we have a cobalt horse , amber owl , a silver ox , yes , okay , a red donkey , and what was the emerald color ? a rooster .
what image did it ultimately become ? a cobalt horse .
and then we had an experiment with a silver ox .
thank you , katy , for taking that photo for me .
and if we did our jobs well , you wo n't know that we were even involved .
`` ed ulbrich : that was a clip from `` '' the curious case of benjamin button . '' '' many of you , maybe you 've seen it or you 've heard of the story , but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film , the main character , benjamin button , who 's played by brad pitt , is completely computer-generated from the neck up . ''
and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character .
so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of brad 's head , aged to appear as benjamin , and attach that to the body of the real actor .
so we focused on motion capture .
you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers .
that 's not terribly compelling .
we needed the subtleties of the skin .
so we aborted using motion capture .
and the sauce was code in software that we 'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one .
and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour .
and now what we 're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture .
the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras , and those cameras can , frame-by-frame , reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject 's doing at the moment .
so , clearly , we were in a substantially better place for this .
we measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count .
we could go up into the millions of polygons .
`` this is when we 're like , `` '' ok , we 're going to be ok , this is actually going to work . '' '' and the `` '' aha ! '' '' was , what if we could take brad pitt , and we could put brad in this device , and use this contour process , and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights , and we could , in fact , scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses . ''
right ? so , effectively , we ended up with a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face is capable of doing .
and we commissioned them to make a maquette , or a bust , of benjamin .
so this is ben 80 .
we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution — enormous polygonal count .
and here 's the resulting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that .
next we had to go into the shooting process .
and so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought brad onto a sound stage in los angeles and he watched on the screen .
and then , the sauce i talked about with our technology stew — that secret sauce was , effectively , software that allowed us to match the performance footage of brad in live action with our database of aged benjamin , the facs shapes that we had .
`` and then this is what we called the `` '' dead head , '' '' no reference to jerry garcia . ''
and then here 's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance .
and then , again , the final shot .
so really , a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that benjamin had to appear so that we could put ben 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that 's on the other actors in the real world .
we also had to create an eye system .
and if you could feel the warmth , and feel the humanity , and feel his intent coming through the eyes , then we would succeed .
there was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue .
he 's also in an old age home , he 's in a nursing home around other old people , so he had to look exactly the same as the others .
( applause ) a couple of quick factoids ; it really took 155 people over two years , and we did n't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut .
what is truer than truth ? answer : the story .
five women , representing five continents , and three olympic gold medal winners .
my first question was , naturally , what was i going to wear ?
( applause ) in the green room of the stadium , i met the other flag bearers : three athletes , and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren .
( laughter ) but so did most of the flag-bearers , except sophia loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion .
all the cameras were , of course , on sophia .
yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor — they have children that they do n't want or they can not feed .
call it aphrodite , or venus , or bimbo , or whatever you want ; the name does n't matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it .
so here 's another tale of passion , and this is a sad one .
the husband , furious , threatens to kill the american .
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop .
does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room — all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
was it working in the sun ?
these jobs are also done by the plants , the animals and the ecosystems on our planet , including the ecosystems i study : the tropical coral reefs .
the structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves , and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play .
`` this magnification of threats , this compounding of factors is what jeremy jackson describes as the `` '' slippery slope to slime . '' '' it 's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime . ''
if they do n't understand what a coral is or where it comes from , or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is , why would we expect them to care about saving them ?
what is a coral and where does it come from ?
corals are born in a number of different ways , but most often by mass spawning : all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year , releasing all the eggs they 've made that year into the water column , packaged into bundles with sperm cells .
when they 're fertilized , they do what any other animal egg does : divides in half again and again and again .
they attach in the place they find most suitable , they build a skeleton underneath themselves , they build a mouth and tentacles , and then they begin the difficult work of building the world 's coral reefs .
but , indeed , much of the caribbean and much of our world is much more like this .
scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world 's coral reefs , and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes .
and we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic .
so we can use this knowledge , we can go back and say we need to restore those factors — that pink , that white , those crevices , those hard surfaces — in our conservation projects .
we can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals .
starting about six years ago , i began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled .
and i tried those one by one by one , looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach .
so this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw .
( laughter ) so we 're starting to figure out the secrets to this process , the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them .
we are limited by the space on our bench , the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour .
we have advanced medical technology , we have defense technology , we have scientific technology , we even have advanced technology for art .
so never mind that they 're worth hundreds of billions of dollars .
and we almost took out an entire generation of corals .
like , why did i really have to mow the lawn ?
why was homework really that important ?
`` in his most famous book , `` '' pedagogy of the oppressed , '' '' he states , `` '' no one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so . '' '' i 've been thinking a lot about this lately , this idea of humanity , and specifically , who in this world is afforded the privilege of being perceived as fully human . ''
these events and all that has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in america that growing up , i did n't always understand in the way that i do now .
for example , i think of how one night , when i was around 12 years old , on an overnight field trip to another city , my friends and i bought super soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water-filled battle zone .
so that we could be kids , not casket or concrete .
that the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath , that you can not simply be curious , that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake , that someone 's implicit bias might be the reason you do n't wake up in the morning .
`` the unforgivable shit i would do to her . '' '' online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy , and it is imperative that it ends . ''
and when we curb abuse , we will expand freedom .
the daffodils were blooming , but the referees were not blowing the whistle when i was telling them to .
( laughter ) funny , they 're very friendly to me before the opening tip , but they really ignore me during the game . ( laughter )
[ @ arkrazorback dirty play can kiss my team 's free throw making a — @ kysportsradio @ marchmadness @ espn bloodied 3 players so far . ] it is routine for me to be treated in the ways i 've already described to you .
my spirituality , my faith , being a hillbilly — i can say that , you ca n't — all of it is fair game .
it 's traumatic .
this is really critical .
it was published , it went viral , it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all , all over the world , and when it is intersectional , it is worse .
i can often get a social media company 's attention .
`` `` oh , you live in an echo chamber . '' ''
`` having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they `` '' ca n't wait to cum on my face , '' '' i have a right to set that boundary . ''
( applause ) and this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what — that actually happened to me once when i was a child , and so that tweet brought up that trauma , and i had to do work on that .
but you know what we do ? we take all of this hate speech , and we disaggregate it , and we code it , and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it : when i get porn , when it 's about political affiliation , when it 's about age , when it 's about all of it .
i 'm going to offer just a few , and of course i challenge you to create and contribute your own .
that is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them .
so apparently , i 've got a pretty bold voice .
`` we 're cool in this room , but when this goes out , everyone will say , `` oh my god , she 's a reverse racist . '' ''
and lastly , believe her .
( applause ) this is fundamentally a problem of human interaction .
and as i believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing , trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred .
`` edith wharton said , `` '' the end is latent in the beginning , '' '' so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech . ''
i would like for you to reflect it back to me .
( laughter ) a : yes , you are .
( applause )
welcome to thailand .
not just child mortality alone , you need also family planning .
seven children per family — tremendous growth at 3.3 percent .
there was just no future .
and this picture was sent throughout the country .
`` we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , `` '' we only want to lend to women who practice family planning . ''
and then we thought we 'd help america , because america 's been helping everyone , whether they want help or not .
of course , it must be american cola .
you get two brands , coke and pepsi .
( laughter ) and here is this , then , young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid .
i 'm not sure whether coca-cola followed us , or we followed coca-cola , but we 're good friends .
and so that 's the case of everyone joining in .
then aids came along and hit thailand , and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids .
`` and after i gave them statistics , they said , `` '' yes . okay . you can use all the radio stations , television stations . '' '' and that 's when we went onto the airwaves . ''
so they were happy with that .
and then we went down one more step .
`` and we said , `` '' everyone needs to be involved . '' '' so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff do n't work , and dead customers do n't buy . ''
look at this — i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also .
and then what happened ?
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
access to credit must be a human right .
and we also ask the next olympics to be involved in saving lives .
my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school .
i 've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i 've explored this nocturnal world .
how do they do that ?
thank you .
`` `` come on adam , do n't be so wishy-washy . take a bite . '' `` i did . '' ''
so , time paradox , i want to argue , the paradox of time perspective , is something that influences every decision you make , you 're totally unaware of .
and always low on past-negative and present-fatalism .
so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past — past-positive gives you roots . you connect your family , identity and your self .
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop-out rates of school kids , combating addictions , enhancing teen health , curing vets ' ptsd with time metaphors — getting miracle cures — promoting sustainability and conservation , reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate , altering appeals to suicidal terrorists , and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes .
in a single cubic foot of this material — about what would come around your computer or large television — you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol .
second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials .
and it 's when this lid goes on the part , that the magic really starts .
because the manufacturing process is our organism .
this matrix self-assembles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
in this case , we 've grown a corner block .
they used to use a plastic packaging buffer , but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material .
they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing , and it 's going to improve the local soil .
and i think that can be some really good news .
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
but what about natural forces ?
i was working on a very interesting technology at mit , but it was a very long-term view of how to develop technology , and it was going to be a very expensive technology , and also it would be patented .
so the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind .
we do n't want to lose pulling power , nor direction .
we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works .
the other thing is , most boats , when they reach a certain speed , and they are going on waves , they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water , and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost .
so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy , but the idea is , what is the purpose of technology if it does n't reach the right hands ?
it 's to replace competition by collaboration .
it 's just an intellectual property setup .
we were peer-learning , we were engineering , we were making things , prototyping , but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible , to fail as quickly as possible , to learn from .
business as usual is saying , what 's most important is to make lots of profit , and you 'll be using technology for that , and people will be your work force , instrumentalized , and environment is usually the last priority .
what 's next for us ?
i was speaking to a group of about 300 kids , ages six to eight , at a children 's museum , and i brought with me a bag full of legs , similar to the kinds of things you see up here , and had them laid out on a table for the kids .
and other things that i do n't — are n't familiar with .
`` and the whole room , including me , was like , `` '' yeah . '' '' ( laughter ) and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as `` '' disabled '' '' to somebody that had potential that their bodies did n't have yet . ''
interesting .
and also these very life-like , intrinsically painted silicone legs .
and the journey started , funny enough , with a ted conference attendee — chee pearlman , who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today .
she was the editor then of a magazine called id , and she gave me a cover story .
`` you do n't look disabled . '' '' ( laughter ) i thought , `` '' well , that 's amazing , because i do n't feel disabled . '' '' and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored , about beauty . ''
poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art .
( laughter ) and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
and the only purpose that these legs can serve , outside the context of the film , is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination .
and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan , my first night out on the town , i went to a very fancy party .
it 's a conversation about augmentation .
it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
thank you .
kt : no .
kb : where are we ? where are we ?
pity , i would have told them it was the ace of spades .
kb : oh , no , no , no . he asked me could he do the left hand . absolutely not .
have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text in order to come across as sad or disappointed ?
have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walked from the check-in to the gate ?
you have now completed the test .
scientists tell us that vaccines are safe .
but how do we know if they are right ?
maybe a few hours on sunday .
this was a huge confirmation of the theory .
but also because in the ideal case , it 's about laws .
it 's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent .
so just because the prediction comes true does n't actually logically prove that the theory is correct .
well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true .
so when nicolaus copernicus said , actually the earth is not the center of the universe , the sun is the center of the solar system , the earth moves around the sun .
that difference , that angular difference , is the stellar parallax .
the first was an assumption about the size of the earth 's orbit .
besides inductive science , scientists also often participate in modeling .
it 's a model that 's made with mathematics , and like the physical models of the 19th century , it 's very important for thinking about causes .
so what , though , is driving that change ?
and they asked the question , what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life ?
and the answer is , scientists judge , and they judge by judging evidence .
we can also think of science as being a kind of a jury , except it 's a very special kind of jury .
it 's not a jury of your peers , it 's a jury of geeks .
scientists can say no , it 's false .
it 's the authority of the collective community .
well , see , now i 'm thinking , i 'm in manhattan , this is a bad analogy , but most americans who do n't live in manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition , and their cars work , and they work incredibly well .
so why is that ? why do cars work so well ?
it 's not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even elon musk .
we use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other .
ca : what are your plans ? mit ? india ?
how are you going to split your time going forward ?
and i did go out , and i did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring , along a roadside .
this rebirth of grass . and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .
i decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we 've transformed .
so in that respect , to me , i 'm not against the corporation .
and these ages of man are still at work today .
`` not to say , `` '' oh my god , what is it ? '' '' but to be challenged by it — to say , `` '' wow , this is beautiful , '' '' on one level , but on the other level , `` '' this is scary . i should n't be enjoying it . '' '' like a forbidden pleasure . and it 's that forbidden pleasure that i think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defines kind of what i feel , too — that i 'm drawn to have a good life . ''
that if we keep putting things , through industrial and urban existence , back into the system — if we keep doing that — we can continue on .
and it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .
and again , it 's actually a relief for what 's going on in china because i think on the table right now , there 's 27 nuclear power stations to be built .
and one of the other things that happened in the three gorges — a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost ; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that .
so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms .
so the industry 's already growing around these new developments .
right now that 's all cleared out — this was done about eight months ago — and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
so they 're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in china .
there 's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs .
it took me five fake tries because they were just going . to slow them down was literally impossible .
`` they were just wound up doing these things all day long , until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say , `` okay , everybody freeze . '' ''
while setting up this shot , people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch .
there 's 21,000 employees . this one factory — and they had several of them — is half a kilometer long .
so it 's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places .
this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley .
this portrait — i 'm not usually known for portraits , but i could n't resist this one , where she 's been through mao , and she 's been through the great leap forward , and the cultural revolution , and now she 's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her . it 's quite something .
and it is through communications today that i believe that that is not an unreal idea .
and the beauty of what 's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that i like .
whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly .
and one of the things that came out — allison , who actually nominated me , said something earlier on in a brainstorming . she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
and she told me — the nurses had n't mentioned this — that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
they come to a certain point and then stop .
`` i said , `` '' is this like a dream ? '' '' and she said , `` '' no , it 's not like a dream . it 's like a movie . '' '' she said , `` '' it 's got color . it 's got motion . ''
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
`` and i then said to her , `` i think i know what you have . '' ''
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris , he saw — this was real — a scaffolding .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
on one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
you smell chestnuts roasting .
so , what is going on ?
it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
( laughter ) i saw an aston martin this morning .
and in the charles bonnet syndrome , you do n't go to those higher levels .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
thanks very much .
( laughter ) well , yeah , a lot of them .
because you understand what 's doing it , it does n't make you worried ?
( applause )
audience : shake . fold .
js : cuts itself .
how ? as soon as it starts , you just tear it off .
as a result , they easily escape into our environment .
not only do phthalates pollute our environment , but they also pollute our bodies .
we noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels , so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels .
jy : to better understand how this biodegradation works , we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains .
to do this , we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid .
we can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources .
thank you . jy : thank you .
( applause )
and whatever number you 're thinking of , it probably is n't as bad as this .
and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low-income families in boston who would come in presenting with housing issues , but always had an underlying health issue .
and at the end of my freshman year of college , i read an article about the work that dr. barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center .
i 'll never forget , the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons .
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients , and especially low-income patients , healthy , that we did n't use it ?
what if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed ?
so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center , when patients come into the doctor 's office , they 're asked a few questions .
`` do you have safe housing ? '' '' and when the doctor begins the visit , she knows height , weight , is there food at home , is the family living in a shelter . ''
and we gave it a shot .
and our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities .
we know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers are n't enough , that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
and the thing is , there 's thousands of these folks already out there .
do they have food to take with the prescription ?
but they are ours for the taking — simple examples of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources that , if we reclaimed and redeployed , could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare .
`` but he said this , `` '' rebecca , when you have a vision , you have an obligation to realize that vision . ''
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
it was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men .
it could have been sean bell .
and while we 're busy pretending not to see , we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference is changing people 's possibilities , that 's keeping them from thriving , and sometimes it 's causing them an early death .
in fact , what they 're suggesting is , stare at awesome black people .
i 'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and made them better .
`` and i saw this person across the street , and i was thinking , `` '' oh great , black guy . '' '' i was going toward him without even thinking about it . ''
`` and she was like , `` '' oh , that 's interesting . '' '' the guy across the street , he was a black guy . ''
how many authentic relationships do you have with young black people , folks , men , women ?
i 'm saying go deeper , closer , further , and build the kinds of relationships , the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes .
and you know , we love grandma and we love uncle joe . we do .
and we need to be able to say something , because you know who else is at the table ?
because we 're not saying anything .
we 've got to take our lovely darlings , our future , and we 've got to tell them we have an amazing country with incredible ideals , we have worked incredibly hard , and we have made some progress , but we are not done .
we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations , and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men .
these are people who are powerful preachers .
they are incredible scientists and artists and writers .
so let 's give this a try .
come on .
what do i mean by the informal in this case ?
but not only houses , also small debris from one city , from san diego , to tijuana .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of bermuda triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
i would like to share with you a new model of higher education , a model that , once expanded , can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind .
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to nigeria .
patrick never gave up his dream of higher education .
wael is from syria .
he 's a big believer in education .
this is the story of countless women in africa , for example , prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers .
and here comes the third reason : unesco stated that in 2025 , 100 million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them , to meet the demand .
patrick , debbie and wael are only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students from 143 countries .
we just looked at what was n't working and used the amazing power of the internet to get around it .
universities have expenses that virtual universities do n't .
we do n't need to pass these expenses onto our students .
by using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible , we do n't need to send our students to buy textbooks .
all of our materials come free .
even professors , the most expensive line in any university balance sheet , come free to our students , over 3,000 of them , including presidents , vice chancellors , professors and academic advisors from top universities such as nyu , yale , berkeley and oxford , came on board to help our students .
we use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments .
when our students are accepted , they are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it .
this way , we open our students ' minds , we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures .
we opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student .
broadband is not necessary .
all right , the mermaid is indeed real , but anyone who 's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this .
but we 're humans — we 're terrestrial mammals .
so , how do i study this ?
and when i started out , i was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe , so i could make sure i 'm actually seeing the light that 's being transformed by the animals .
and we 're rubbing our eyes , checking the filters , thinking that somebody 's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera , but the eel was real .
but then we started to find other fluorescent marine life , like this green fluorescent bream , with its , like , racing stripes along its head and its nape , and it 's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there .
he would design his own gear , make his own cameras , and he was fascinated with the seahorse , hippocampus erectus , and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth .
and here 's our footage .
( music ) they 're the most cryptic fish .
you could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse .
and then we found it .
but this is all beautiful to see .
i was like , this is gorgeous .
there 's no biofluorescent marine life down there , below 1,000 meters — almost nothing , it 's just darkness .
so he could see when a single neuron fires .
mark twain summed up what i take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism .
`` one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact . '' '' ( laughter ) twain meant it as a joke , of course , but he 's right : there 's something fascinating about science . ''
let me start with the problem of generalization .
we see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial , and we bring drugs to a national market .
and if you 're a baby , that 's like a ted talk .
all right , it 's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls , and it 's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us , but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time .
and if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks , maybe everything in the box squeaks .
let me show you another example now , this time about a problem of causal reasoning .
and this might not seem like a problem to you , but like most problems , it 's only a problem when things go wrong .
he would like to make this toy go , and he ca n't .
i 'll show you a few-second clip .
and there 's two possibilities , broadly : maybe he 's doing something wrong , or maybe there 's something wrong with the toy .
i am then going to try twice and fail both times , and then hyowon is going to try again and succeed , and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board .
ls : okay , laura , but of course , babies love their mommies .
this time , hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once , and so am i .
( video ) hg : two , three , go ! ( music ) let me try one more time . one , two , three , go !
`` eighteen months later , it 's talking to you , and babies ' first words are n't just things like balls and ducks , they 're things like `` '' all gone , '' '' which refer to disappearance , or `` '' uh-oh , '' '' which refer to unintentional actions . ''
( applause ) ca : and if i understand you right , the other key point you 're making is , we 've been through these years where there 's all this talk of how quirky and buggy our minds are , that behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that that we 're not rational agents .
there are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day that get the world right .
`` and she said , `` '' no , the lego is the treasure . '' '' ( laughter ) and then she said , `` '' dad , we 're lego rich . '' '' i was like , `` '' yeah . ''
`` and at a certain point , you look around , you 're like , `` '' whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd . '' '' and i mean like this is a nerdy crowd , but that 's like a couple of levels above furries . ''
so when i do my job , people hate me .
that , by the way , in case you 're paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
i 'm not perfect , but what i am is optimistic , because i do n't just get hate mail .
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
over the past few years , i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
this is a person going for a walk .
the next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .

`` he said , `` '' it 's tough to make predictions , especially about the future . '' '' i 'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast . ''
this is the best economic news on the planet these days .
this is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons .
now , some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism , but that 's absolutely the wrong way to look at it .
so this is a time of great flourishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physicist freeman dyson , is not hyperbole at all .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
over this time frame , ted has continued to hold a full-time job . bill has n't .
other ways that bill is dropping out of society ?
so i can not tell a happy story about these social trends , and they do n't show any signs of reversing themselves .
i do n't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough .
we 're facing very tough challenges .
the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
`` winston churchill came to my home of mit in 1949 , and he said , `` '' if we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance , it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production . '' '' abraham lincoln realized there was one other ingredient . ''
thank you very much .
in essence , they are not different .
`` roland barthes once said of flaubert 's novels , `` '' flaubert did not write a novel . ''
when you were little , i bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art .
kids have to go to lessons , to school , do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons , but they are n't fun anymore .
if you 're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall , you 'll surely get in trouble with your mom .
`` i was trying my best , and my teacher came around and asked me , `` '' what are you doing ? '' '' `` `` i 'm drawing diligently , '' '' i said . ''
`` then my teacher said , `` really ? well , young-ha , you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling . '' ''
contemporary art , i later discovered , is n't explained by a lame story like mine .
that was duchamp .
they get locked in .
people who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the internet all night long .
we become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv .
where i teach students in drama school , there 's a course called dramatics .
i have another experience : in my writing class , i give students a special assignment .
so i give them blank sheets of paper and a theme .
it can be a simple theme : write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood .
why we can not be something is not important .
it saves our souls and makes us live happily .
`` so i asked the driver , `` '' what is this ? '' '' he said it was his profile . `` `` then what are you ? '' '' i asked . `` `` an actor , '' '' he said . ''
gotcha !
as humans , we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers .
they taught him music — scales , in fact .
saint yared was a real , historical figure , and the natural world can be our musical teacher .
every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees , whether it 's mandarin chinese , where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning , to a language like english , where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ...
`` `` lickih nehu . '' ''
the musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score , which was actually purchased by the museum of modern art — the score , that is .
( laughter ) it is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves : their coughs , their sighs , their rustles , their whispers , their sneezes , the room , the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting , creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold , the pipes clanking and contributing .
we are already immersed .
when seeking melodic inspiration , look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language .
even their calendar system begins with the birth of kim il-sung .
even then , our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the great leader .
we were never allowed to discuss the outside world .
as students of science and technology , many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the internet .
`` we played `` '' truth and lie . '' '' a volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard , and the other students had to guess whether it was a truth or a lie . ''
in one of their personal letters to me , a student wrote that he understood why i always called them gentlemen .
but i think they knew how sad i was for them .
the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean spring , but i do n't want you to do anything risky , because i know in your world , someone is always watching .
in fact , most of the rights that we have today in this country — as women , as minorities , as workers , as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment — these rights were n't handed to us .
( laughter ) nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent , not physically , but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive , and then denying them those sources of power .
you can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them .
but it 's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it .
violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were , because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective .
the air jordan 3 black cement did for sneakers what the iphone did for phones .
every celebrity 's been seen wearing it .
and while that 's obviously the anomaly , the resell sneaker market is definitely not .
thirty years in the making , what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much — ( laughter ) now we have sneaker addictions .
in the pantheon of great collections , mine does n't even register .
so i thought , i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data , just to play with for my own amusement .
the goal was to develop a price guide , a real data-driven view of the market .
you have to be 18 to play the stock market .
and profit on the secondary market is about a third .
nike lines happen 104 times more often .
never knowing who had the best price , or even if the stock you were looking at was real .
and not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner , but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market .
and that 's why we 're talking about sneakers .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
so the real question then is : how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and hiv ?
now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
but in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual .
in addition , these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto , and what 's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine , and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
this strategy , working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
so to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
but this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the u.s. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
the developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're leapfrogging the west .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
some day , perhaps soon , we 'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
ca : and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
that 's what europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what michael specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd did n't really want that to happen .
the world needs people like you . thank you .
and there 's something nice about slides getting stuck .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we wo n't see tonight . so .
with that , let 's get the first slide up here .
everything 's gotten simpler in design , and here 's this mega airport , and god , i just — i took a picture .
so , here 's the first door . you know , you get the message .
you know , it 's pretty clear .
( laughter ) same color , same message , same words .
( laughter ) yet it does n't say that ; it does n't need to say that .
`` and at the end of the film , he says in this great voice that i ca n't mimic but i 'll kind of try , but not really , he says , `` '' i remember attending an exhibition called , 'photography : the end of painting . ' '' '' and then he says , `` '' and , of course , it was n't at all . '' '' so , apparently when photography was perfected , there were people going around saying , that 's it : you 've just ruined painting . ''
`` there comes a leap in consciousness — call it intuition or what you will — and the solution just comes to you , and you do n't know from where or why . '' '' so , it 's kind of like when somebody says , who did that song ? ''
`` so , a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says , `` the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature . '' ''
( laughter ) there was some bomb shelter built , apparently in the '60s cuban missile crisis .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
and my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture .
i was in the caribbean at christmas , and i 'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell — not that they will sell — that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin .
( laughter ) i did some work for microsoft a few years back .
you know : thank god it 's monday — i get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else 's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
`` it says , `` '' wonder around . '' '' and then it 's a piece of the software . ''
`` there 's a lot of great writing in `` '' ray gun . '' '' and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books . ''
`` look at the image of this lady — who knows what she 's going through ? — and the copy says : `` '' he knows just how to give me goosebumps . '' '' yeah , he jumps out of buildings . it 's — unfortunately , this one works , kind of , as a spread . ''
i 'm not sure this is an improvement , or a good idea , because , like , if you do n't spend quite enough time in front of your computer , you can now get a plate in the keyboard , so there 's no more faking it — that you do n't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway .
( laughter ) i 'm sure she never found the dog , because i took the sign . ( laughter )
you 're going to be dead a really long time .
the librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
on the right are some tugs from a company called aethon in pittsburgh .
in fact , robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways .
and ordinary people ca n't interact with them .
the eyes are on the screen there .
and baxter 's safe to interact with .
it feels the force , understands that chris is there and does n't push through him and hurt him .
and when he grabs an arm , it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen .
she decided she really liked robots .
and so our vision is that mildred who 's the line worker becomes mildred the robot trainer .
this is the percentage of adults who are working age .
and it 's gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
if we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers , before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older .
and as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
so they do n't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them .
i think people are very similar , but i also think that we have trouble seeing that .
since the dawn of human history , we 've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossiping with friends . this is nothing new .
`` any dot can be clicked and expanded . and we see here , `` '' i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips . '' '' so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions . ''
`` and all of these are stated by people : `` '' i know that objectively it really does n't mean much , but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond , it 's nice to feel bigger again . '' '' the dots exhibit human qualities . they kind of have their own physics , and they swarm wildly around , kind of exploring the world of life . ''
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
`` we see , `` '' i feel like i have been at a computer all day . '' '' ( laughter ) these are automatically constructed using the found objects : `` i think i feel a little full . '' ''
`` so as you can see , we feel fine uses a technique that i call `` '' passive observation . '' '' what i mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives . it scans the world 's blogs and looks at what people are writing , and these people do n't know they 're being watched or interviewed . ''
they 're just living life , and they end up just acting like that .
another technique is directly questioning people .
now , these are n't just little points of light , little pixels .
each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world — a quote that was stated by somebody , an image , a news story , a person , a company . you know , some kind of heroic personality .
and those are the constellations of today .
we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband 's coffin .
we can pull out his secrets , and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates , hillary , presidential , barack obama .
we can also see a world map , so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so .
you know , this is really an infinite thing .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
because nobody 's going to help you and support you if you 're not managing your own finances well .
that smoothened out . we were able to save , just before i left , 27 billion dollars . whereas — and this went to our reserves — when i arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves .
so all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
barclays bank of the u.k. is bringing in 500 million .
and i can go on . dollars , on and on , into the system .
so in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of african countries have had multi-party democratic elections .
but you should know that this continent is not — is a continent of many countries , not one country .
and if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there 's plenty of opportunity .
the best way to help africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
so i invite you to explore the opportunities .
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children .
yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan .
lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others .
these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities .
in fact , more than 95 percent of these children have living parents , and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty , disability and ethnicity .
awareness-raising is required at every level of society .
and along the way , he became the face for the us government 's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists .
but it 's impossible to exercise that right if the media ca n't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them .
suddenly , after years of claiming it was vital to their case , the government dropped their demands to risen altogether .
someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .
that someday is already here if you 're a mouse .
the world 's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda , and they may .
if you ask the internet , this is what you 'll be told .
( laughter ) but no , this is n't a working mother .
`` just put the term `` '' working mother '' '' into any google image search engine , stock photo site . ''
`` ( laughter ) nothing says `` '' give that girl a promotion '' '' like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation . ''
i 'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today .
they are totally real , some of them are very raw , and not one of them looks anything like this .
so we choose to look at , and believe , this image .
but i know what it tells us .
ok , this is pop quiz time : what percentage of working women in america do you think have no access to paid maternity leave ?
every morning , i asked myself how much longer i could do it .
every day , i cried all the way to work and all the way home again .
we have decided — decided , not an accident , to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies .
childbirth is a public good .
but all of us have voices .
we have to stop framing this as a mother 's issue , or even a women 's issue .
we need to stop being comforted by them .
let me tell you a story .
rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have , it could invent new behaviors .
that was perfectly okay 200 million years ago .
so let me describe briefly how it works .
well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex .
it 'll be expanded without limit .
( applause )
no one knows if he got to the top . it 's still a mystery .
`` but he was credited with coining the phrase , `` '' because it 's there . '' '' now i 'm not actually sure that he did say that . ''
there 's very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , i 've printed this . i 'm going to read it out .
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
i remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter .
we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger . part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly i was just utterly terrified .
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean .
and that , i guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
and it seems to me , therefore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to engage , to endeavor , rather than to watch and to wonder , that 's where the real meat of life is to be found , the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days .
i ca n't explain quite how good it is until you 've tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship i 've ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
this is a photo of captain scott and his team .
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
`` is there a chance you 'll see her there ? '' '' ( laughter ) but scott 's journey remains unfinished . ''
it is , arguably , the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
it will take us about four months to make this return journey .
that 's the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
( applause )
this is the national palace — the equivalent of the white house .
this is the ministry of economics and finance .
this is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades , and it was not a natural disaster — it was a disaster of engineering .
andre told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
( applause )
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony .
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
`` reductive listening is listening `` '' for . '' '' it reduces everything down to what 's relevant and it discards everything that 's not relevant . ''
`` so he 's saying , `` '' i 've got this problem . '' '' he 's saying , `` '' here 's your solution . thanks very much . next . '' '' that 's the way we talk , right guys ? ''
it looks a bit like this .
if you ca n't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it 's too loud .
and thirdly , if you 're in bad sound , it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it .
seek those sounds out ; they 're good for you and so it this .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
i think , while i 'm enjoying my life as a happy musician , i 'm earning a lot more recognition than i 've ever imagined .
but it 's now your turn .
just play your life with all you have , and share it with the world .
i was raised by lesbians in the mountains , and i sort of came like a forest gnome to new york city a while back .
i can make free-floating lines , like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene .
so i took the objects out , and i created my own taxonomy of invented specimens .
first , botanical — which you can kind of get a sense of .
( laughter ) at some point , i got up to the human form , life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers .
do you guys know this painting ?
it 's kind of weird .
that happens , you know .
her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball , made out of 1986 terrorist cards .
way ahead of their time .
that 's his head ; there 's the chest , you can kind of see the beginning .
i 'm going to go down the body for you : there 's a waterfall coming out of his chest , covering his penis — or not-penis , or whatever it is , a kind of androgynous thing .
and you come together to realize that we 're all in this together , that this delusion of difference — this idea of countries , of borders , of religion — does n't work .
last year , three of my family members were gruesomely murdered in a hate crime .
he asks me to come over and comb his hair in preparation for his wedding photo shoot .
even in that moment , when everything was so distracting , he was attuned to me .
thank you for everything .
and she is .
my littler brother , a basketball-obsessed kid , had become and transformed into an accomplished young man .
that is who they were .
i fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor , wailing .
they were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith , because of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads , because they were visibly muslim .
he offers to set up a press conference at a local community center .
these days , it feels like islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry .
i look around expectantly .
`` i sit on her bed and gently ask her , `` '' have i ever done anything but treat you with respect and kindness ? ''
within a month , she joined the faculty at the university of virginia , where she now works on pluralism , race , faith and culture .
will you be neal ?
it may feel really small , but i promise you it makes a difference .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
`` he says to me , `` '' we 've done some work around the country . ''
but understand what you 're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female , so that we could put it in any of these people .
it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
they take the load off , and it becomes , again , compliant .
i 'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
this weighs 6.9 pounds .
now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there 's something about honeybees that draws people into their world .
i had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
it kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony , and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity .
so honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years .
in our collective conscience , in a really primal way , we know we ca n't afford to lose bees .
and they 're trucked in in semi-loads , and they must be trucked out , because after bloom , the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape .
this small bee is holding up a large mirror .
it 's aptly named .
so what are we going to do ?
the latest numbers on the die-off of bees , is there any sign of things bottoming out ?
maria spivak : yeah .
so it 's getting precarious .
( applause )
how do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business ?
we create dedicated structure processed systems , basically to deal with the new complexity of business .
you have mr. noise , mr. petrol consumption , mr. anti-collision properties .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
so , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
but what occurs for zero impact ? mr. repairability , process , scorecard , evaluation , coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact .
now , in front of the new complexity of business , the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines .
the connections , the interactions , the synapses .
instead of one problem between the back and the front , now i have two problems .
it is even counterproductive .
precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife .
simple rule number one : understand what others do .
when you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , i hold you by the ear .
suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses , my real forecast , because i know i will not be blamed if i fail , but if i fail to help or ask for help .
this is my two at home , kendall and jay .
there was a period of time when my wife — her name is tammie — and i , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : kendall and jay .
tell me what 's wrong . i ca n't understand you .
i think back to my father .
my brother , henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
and as we were preparing to come back from the burial , the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city .
he did n't want cry in front of me , but he knew he was n't going to make it back to the city , and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women .
and this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
his grandmother had two jobs .
`` so , like my mother would say , make a long story short , i just simply said to johnny , `` '' yes . '' '' he told me to go in his room . ''
she 's what i know today to be mentally ill , higher-functioning at times than others .
anyway , johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
so when i go in the room , i close the door .
this fear , getting outside the man box , totally enveloped me .
you see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and objectification is the foundation and the violence ca n't happen without it .
so we 're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
the death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes : criticizing the king , stealing a loaf of bread . slavery , of course , was the preferred labor-saving device , and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment . perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning , in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire , and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat , howling in pain , was burned to death .
there 's a cognitive illusion . we cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something , the higher the probability that you assign to it .
that 's a process that seems to be continuing , but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day , things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards . so today , we get exercised — and rightly so — if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in texas after a 15-year appeal process . we do n't consider that a couple of hundred years ago , they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted 10 minutes , and indeed , that that would have been repeated over and over again . today , we look at capital punishment
`` well , why has violence declined ? no one really knows , but i have read four explanations , all of which , i think , have some grain of plausibility . the first is , maybe thomas hobbes got it right . he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was `` '' solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short . '' '' not because , he argued , humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative , but because of the logic of anarchy . in a state of anarchy , there 's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively , before they invade you . more recently , thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling ''
`` the result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead , and violence declines for selfish reasons . as wright put it , `` '' among the many reasons that i think that we should not bomb the japanese is that they built my mini-van . '' '' ( laughter ) the fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called `` '' the expanding circle , '' '' by the philosopher peter singer , who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy , an ability to treat other peoples ' interests as comparable to one 's own . unfortunately , by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family . ''
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .
these boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents , and they are put to work as sex slaves .
this is nadir .
tapestries were ubiquitous between the middle ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why .
and for me as a curator , i felt proud . i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little .
that was an interesting case .
`` it was a such a visceral , emotive experience . '' '' now , i 've described two very immersive exhibitions , but i also believe that collections , individual objects , can also have that same power . ''
some of them are comfortable . they feel at home .
others are very uneasy . it 's an intimidating place .
i want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind , where they 're prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the unfamiliar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
you know it 's an orgy .
in short , the tech companies have democratized encryption .
so the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that i 've described — this is not imaginary .
it means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys .
or two : you give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs .
africa shall rise .
just think about this problem for a second .
this is what i spoke about in the last ted .
today i 'll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action .
mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly .
so , it 's empathizing the other person being touched .
you 've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
you are , in fact , connected not just via facebook and internet , you 're actually quite literally connected by your neurons .
so , here you have my last slide .
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock .
we used to read ; now we speed read . we used to walk ; now we speed walk .
but there 's a very serious point , and i think that in the headlong dash of daily life , we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us .
and this went on for some time , until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people .
i just thought , and i thought long and hard .
in other cultures , time is cyclical .
we try and do more and more with less and less time .
and it 's driven by a very simple and sensible message , which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate , cook and consume it at a reasonable pace .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing .
i 'm 37 , and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s , and i look at kids now , and i 'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework , more tutoring , more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago .
i mean , you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness , and that 's true , but that 's not all of it .
i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time .
one is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sexy .
because people at the top of the chain , people like you , i think , are starting to realize that there 's too much speed in the system , there 's too much busyness , and it 's time to find , or get back to that lost art of shifting gears .
and perhaps , the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper , richer , stronger .
he spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult , and his crowning glory was the building of a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital 's central square and rotated to follow the sun .
now get this : until recently , he was earning an official monthly salary of less than 7,000 dollars .
we 've spent a great deal of time investigating a $ 1 billion — that 's right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shocking , but more about that later .
and that 's how my relationship with corruption really began .
our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in cambodia .
so let 's go back to some of those people i talked about earlier .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies , totaling almost 56 billion dollars .
so we spoke to sources in country , trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal .
now , that 's not bad going for a convicted money launderer .
after many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents , we found evidence that , in fact , shell and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company , and frankly , it 's hard to believe they did n't know who they were really dealing with there .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
( laughter ) in the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , i would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
in the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we do n't realize it .
( noise of shooting arrow ) ( applause ) a bow may function in a simple mechanism , but in order to make a good bow , a great amount of sensitivity is required .
now , some of you might hear this and feel sad .
it felt like a provocation .
ok , so is better off just a number ?
all right , so we 're not finding steady employment , we 're not earning as much money , and we 're not living in big fancy houses .
and all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation by employers and financial institutions .
nothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor is anything but profoundly immoral .
so my grandfather , their son , became a traveling salesman , and he lived boom and bust .
could n't write this in a novel , right ?
and ironically , and probably sometimes to their frustration , it is their steadfast commitment to security that allows me to question its value , or at least its value as we 've historically defined it in the 21st century .
they 're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons .
`` now , artist ann hamilton has said , `` labor is a way of knowing . '' labor is a way of knowing . ''
by prioritizing care , men are , in a sense , staking their claim to the full range of human existence .
`` so we need to stop asking kids , `` what do you want to be when you grow up ? '' ''
we need to seriously consider a universal basic income .
the promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit our 21st century values , not some archaic idea about bringing home the bacon , is long overdue — just ask your mother .
now , i 've experienced this firsthand .
`` either they say , `` '' why does n't everyone live like this ? '' '' or they say , `` '' that sounds totally horrifying . ''
i know that i am not a tribute to my great-grandmother , who lived such a short and brutish life , if i earn enough money to afford every creature comfort .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
the biggest danger is achieving a dream that you do n't actually believe in .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
we back so far up we 're finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the big bang .
and we can network between domes and classrooms .
but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india .
this is nepal and tibet .
and just in closing , i 'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out — so i 'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is .
it is a tool for our allies to show up differently for us .
i witnessed my brothers and my siblings continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement .
why us ?
opal tometi : and antiblack racism — ( applause ) and antiblack racism is not only happening in the united states .
and what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement that challenges systemic racism in every single context .
this is unconscionable .
and this would not happen if this nation did n't have a population that was black , and we have to be real about that .
the reality is that race in the united states operates on a spectrum from black to white .
so a bubble up rather than a trickle down .
let me give an example .
if we were to talk about indigenous women , if we were to talk about trans women , it would even go further down .
ag : effervescence — like champagne .
patrisse , let 's start with you .
( applause ) mb : what about you , opal ?
i 've come up with this new mantra after coming back from a three-month sabbatical , which is rare for black women to take who are in leadership , but i felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team to also practice stepping back as well as also sometimes stepping in .
you know , in this process of my sabbatical , i was really reminded of this southern african philosophy of ubuntu .
and i realized that my own leadership , and the contributions that i 'm able to make , is in large part due to the contributions that they make , right ?
ag : yeah ...
we can have disagreements without being disagreeable , but it 's important for us to sharpen each other , so that we all can rise .
we have images of our death on the tv screen , on our twitter timelines , on our facebook timelines , but what if instead we imagine black life ?
we imagine black people living and thriving .
the water protectors are being forcibly removed from the camp that they have set up to defend what keeps us alive .
ot : that 's right .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
( laughter ) ( music ) ( applause )
my archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad 's books , my photographs .
i mean , this was — was i my things ?
i cherish the future .
that 's my camera lens . the first one — the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
`` that 's my feature film . `` `` king , murray '' '' won cannes film festival 1970 — the only print i had . ''
`` `` '' sputnik '' '' was downtown , the negative . it was n't touched . ''
it 's the only copy i had . pieces of it .
i mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
so , i was so disturbed by what i saw , and i was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards , that i decided i would take six months off .
i was 28 years old .
every time any westerners came to the village , she hid the girl .
and of course , i was immediately intrigued .
and i was paying for this myself , so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week .
her mother was not raising her , her grandmother was raising her .
and so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
`` and i said to my translator , `` '' what 's going on , why is she crying ? '' '' and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment , and then she started getting tears in her eyes . ''
i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother .
and i went to that address and knocked on the door , and a man answered the door .
`` and i said to the translator , `` '' what did he say ? '' '' and she said , `` '' he wants to know who you are . '' '' and i said , `` '' well , tell him that i am a photographer . '' '' i started explaining who i was , and he interrupted . ''
i was very worried about her .
`` i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her . '' '' i said , `` '' but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i 'm stuck here for a week . '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm staying in a hotel downtown . ''
`` i do n't pretend to understand what 's going on here . '' '' i said , `` '' all i know is , i 've been photographing a lot of these children . '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm in love with your niece , i think she 's an incredibly special child . '' '' and i said , `` '' look , i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them , to see if you approve of them . ''
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
this is father keene . he 's just a wonderful guy .
this may be one of those myth-buster things that we 'll have to clear up here , in a minute .
and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary .
now , we went out to dinner that night to celebrate .
the uncle went back to his family , and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner .
now , i 'd been staying in this room for about three months — it was a little 15-story korean hotel .
and we fall asleep — and i 've been in this room , you know , for a couple of months now .
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
i remember sitting near the bed , and i was just so — i had two overwhelming feelings .
so , we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall , we put blankets at the bottom of the door , we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air .
five people jumped and died , other people were killed by the smoke .
and there 's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this , and people were shouting in korean .
and i remember , natasha did n't want us opening the door — sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we 'd spent so much time barricading the room .
in any case , 12 hours later , i mean , they put us in the lobby .
gene ended up using his coat , and his fist in the coat , to break open a liquor cabinet .
people were lying on the floor .
natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers , and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man 's birthday .
so , these are the greenhouse tents .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i could n't believe it .
she entered seventh grade at her own age level .
pledge of allegiance for the first time .
now , remember the picture , how much she looked like her grandmother , at the beginning ?
and kylie — i mean , it was almost like kylie was her own child .
the captain of the cheerleaders .
beauty pageant .
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .
what happened ?
these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton , and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground , they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands .
`` so in his book , `` '' regenesis , '' '' which i recommend , he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species , and he has a machine called the multiplex automated genome engineering machine . ''
it 's kind of like an evolution machine .
you try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip , and the ones that win , that you can then put into a living organism . it 'll work .
okay , the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon . they 're abundant . there 's some around here .
now , there 's work to do .
henri , from the netherlands , with a dutch last name i wo n't try to pronounce , is working on the aurochs .
another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa .
now there are 880. they 're increasing in population by three percent a year .
do you want extinct species back ?
they 're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you .
but for the most part , we 're good at this .
and in fact , hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this .
they probably had n't heard of the artists .
this bias seems to show up very early .
they test the babies own food preferences , and babies typically prefer the graham crackers .
so often they 're rational and useful , but sometimes they 're irrational , they give the wrong answers , and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences .
these stereotypes and biases have real-world consequences , both subtle and very important .
they were the same baseball cards .
`` so if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families , you might give them a book like this . [ `` '' heather has two mommies '' '' ] if you are conservative and have a different attitude , you might give them a book like this . ''
people do n't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics .
`` our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy , could motivate us to write a book like `` '' uncle tom 's cabin , '' '' or read a book like `` '' uncle tom 's cabin , '' '' and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us from acting upon our impulses when , as rational beings , we feel we should be constrained . ''
`` we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job , for an award , we are strongly biased by their race , we are biased by their gender , we are biased by how attractive they are , and sometimes we might say , `` '' well fine , that 's the way it should be . '' '' but other times we say , `` '' this is wrong . '' '' and so to combat this , we do n't just try harder , but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information ca n't bias us , which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens , so the only information they have ''
i woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
i do not remember what time it was .
i looked out the windows and i saw a full half-circle of explosion .
but there 's another side that i have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it .
`` but i think the worst kind of fear is the fear — as samia , a bosnian woman , once told me , who survived the four-years besiege of sarajevo ; she said , `` '' the fear of losing the 'i ' in me , the fear of losing the 'i ' in me . '' '' that 's what my mother in iraq used to tell me . ''
it 's like dying from inside-out .
`` a palestinian woman once told me , `` it is not about the fear of one death , '' she said , `` '' sometimes i feel i die 10 times in one day , '' '' as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets . ''
we are missing my mother 's story , who made sure with every siren , with every raid , with every cut off-of electricity , she played puppet shows for my brothers and i , so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions .
there is a side that leads the front-line discussion , and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs . there is a side
we must have a full picture of what that means .
and i do argue that women lead the back-line discussion , but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion .
`` she said , `` '' but what i worry about the most is not any of that . ''
that girl that i told you about ended up starting women for women international group that impacted one million people , sent 80 million dollars , and i started this from zero , nothing , nada , [ unclear ] .
i can , however , give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have .
it 's in the eye of the beholder .
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
it did not evolve for natural survival .
it 's women who actually push history forward .
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
is n't that exhaustively cultural ?
and once again , i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
i have in mind the so-called acheulian hand axes .
these acheulian hand axes — they 're named after st. acheul in france , where finds were made in 19th century — have been unearthed in their thousands , scattered across asia , europe and africa , almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed .
and the plot really thickens when you realize that , unlike other pleistocene tools , the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges .
competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities — intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability , conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .
so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone , do n't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful .
your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it , even before they could put their love into words .
to me , the sky is always gray , flowers are always gray , and television is still in black and white .
but , since the age of 21 , instead of seeing color , i can hear color .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
it 's like going to a nightclub .
before , i used to dress in a way that it looked good .
( laughter ) and it might happen the opposite , the other way around . so i really enjoy creating , like , sound portraits of people .
prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman .
i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control .
and i 've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms , from , say , the ecological , okay .
so like , you ca n't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease , and inbreeding and incest and , let 's see , what 's the other one ?
it 's not pleasant .
i 'm sorry if i put that idea in your head .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue .
its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high-agility movements .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
now , ok , you can open your eyes .
only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women 's lives , how they would become role models for their own community , did some agree .
when we first met , she was barely able to write her name .
fayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married .
she is now 26 .
the arab states are going through tremendous change , and the struggles women face are overwhelming .
allison hunt : my three minutes has n't started yet , has it ?
finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting — almost a year .
`` i 'm going to replace your hip — it 's about an 18-month wait . '' '' 18 more months . ''
i would n't have my new hip for tedglobal in africa .
oh yeah .
we do not think that way .
i worked alone .
`` it 's gon na be so great when the pain stops . ow ! '' '' all the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer . ''
my next surgeon 's appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor 's office .
two reasons .
and even though it was n't the kind of art that i was ultimately passionate about , it felt great .
i actually did n't even have a regular pair of scissors .
so i got out of school , i got a job , i got a paycheck , i got myself to the art store , and i just went nuts buying supplies .
surprisingly , they just handed them right over , and then with some pencils i already had , i made this project for only 80 cents .
it really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless .
this seemed like the ultimate limitation , being an artist without art .
( laughter ) then i opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally .
i looked for temporary materials , like spitting out food — ( laughter ) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine .
what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation , as each time i created , the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project .
it turned out to be about life , and having life skills .
because ultimately , most of what we do takes place here , inside the box , with limited resources .
( applause )
i was fatalistic .
but she understood one basic principle about young people like me .
i told her a story about my uncle ruben .
he would take me to work with him because i was broke , and he knew i needed some money .
but what do teachers like ms. russ do to succeed with young people like the ones i study ?
these very same stories and experiences already have grit , character and resilience in them .
so let 's help young people refine those stories .
but if i was born without any straps on my boots — ( laughter ) how am i supposed to pick myself up ?
he told us his story .
let 's believe in young people .
this is oliver medvedik . he 's not a vending machine , but he is one of the founders of genspace , a community biolab in brooklyn , new york , where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow e. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry dna .
in fact , i saw oliver do one of these strawberry dna extractions about a year ago , and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that i 'm going to talk to you right now .
and i was at a dinner party with some friends , some artist friends , and i was telling them about this project , and they could n't believe that you could actually see dna .
this is what that looked like .
`` why are they numbered ? is this person more rare than the other one ? '' '' and i had n't even thought about that . ''
they were just numbered because that was the order that i extracted the dna in .
and so , of course , i decided to create an art installation called the dna vending machine .
we 're in the first edition of 100 pieces , hoping to do another edition pretty soon .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect , whether on the roof of a temple in singapore , or in his increasingly ambitious installation work , here with 192 functioning sewing machines , fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations .
they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization , and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work .
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art , subodh gupta .
and finally number 10 , last and certainly not least , ranjani shettar , who lives and works here in the state of karnataka , creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial , and brings , like subodh , the local global .
and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space , and interact with the objects .
10 artists , six minutes , i know that was a lot to take in .
but i can only hope i 've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .
i 'm a neuroscientist , a professor at the university of california .
so i 've looked at about 70 of these .
the pattern is that those people , every one of them i looked at , who was a murderer , and was a serial killer , had damage to their orbital cortex , which is right above the eyes , the orbits , and also the interior part of the temporal lobe .
now the only person — it turns out one son and one daughter , siblings , did n't get along and their patterns are exactly the same .
and we do n't know where it 's going to pop up .
( laughter )
and then there are some that are , well , not so good .
they really suck , actually , because you do n't know what they 're trying to say .
( laughter ) and then there are others that are about people .
well , with cards , most people tend to draw clear , more detailed , and more logical nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and so what does that mean ?
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
so it would be able to replicate the information that is on the dvd .
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
you can add a third dimensionality to the film .
and you see here a picture of a tissue section .
and what you see there in that tissue section , in fact , is you see that reflector tape .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they 're programmably degradable .
so it allows for the recovery of what we 've stored before .
we 're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to replace a vein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics , perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt , maybe carry your drugs in your pocket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thread of silk .
thank you .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
this is actually the first picture i took in the book .
but we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .
so this is great for pickled vegetables , which is what we 're canning here .
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
`` the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called `` '' the wait for the 30-hour hamburger just got longer . '' '' because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours . ''
most of the characteristic char-grilled taste does n't come from the wood or the charcoal .
now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in — and that part does use photoshop — just the edges .
and so those coals that kept falling off the edge , we kept having to put them back up .
but hey , they grow back .
i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook .
here 's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue , or other radiant heat source , goes as you move away from it .
you know , there 's two ways you can make a product .
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it .
and it 's really simple , as you can see here .
people cross oceans to go see them .
they jump high . they wear red .
you might be wondering , who are these people ?
these are the maasais .
my mother , my grandmother , my aunties , they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by .
( laughter ) cool , yeah ?
i went to school not because the maasais ' women or girls were going to school .
why did she say that ?
and if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult .
when i went to school , i had a dream .
`` so he figured out . `` `` well , '' '' he said , `` '' okay , you 'll go to school after the ceremony . '' '' i did . the ceremony happened . ''
we walked out to the courtyard , and there were a bunch of people waiting .
and as we danced and danced , and we approached this circle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
three weeks later , i was healed , and i was back in high school .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
well , while i was in high school , something happened .
but the problem is , my father is not the only father i have .
there 's a belief among our people that morning brings good news .
`` `` well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? '' ''
i found snow !
i learned that that ceremony that i went through when i was 13 years old , it was called female genital mutilation .
i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . i had a right .
`` as i went back , i started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and i said , `` '' i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you . what do you need ? '' '' as i spoke to the women , they told me , `` you know what we need ? we really need a school for girls . '' ''
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she 's punished .
`` and i said , `` '' well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education . ''
angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
a transformation had begun in her life .
that 's sharon . that 's five years later .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
be the first . people will follow you .
( applause )
a caterpillar 's mouth .
on there is bacteria , and near that bacteria , 10 times smaller , a virus .
let 's first visit our planet , but at night , and from space .
this is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime , if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet . and the thing you would notice first , of course , is how dominant the human presence on our planet is .
but let 's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime .
this is part of the amazon basin , a place called rondônia in the south-center part of the brazilian amazon .
if we come back to the same place in 2001 , what we 're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads , and more roads after that , at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really carefully , there 's a thin white line through that kind of seam , and there 's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle .
these soybeans are being shipped to europe and to china as animal feed , especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago , where we do n't want to feed animals animal protein anymore , because that can transmit disease .
instead , we want to feed them more vegetable proteins .
now , the irony is , it 's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the twin cities .
the difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food , or maybe golf courses in scottsdale , you take your pick .
well , that 's not even the worst example in the world .
now , a lot you will remember this from your geography classes .
those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east , where snow melts , it travels down the river through the desert , and forms the great aral sea .
well , in the 1950s , the soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton , believe it or not , in kazakhstan , to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the soviet union .
they really needed the money .
it 's pretty extraordinary .
it 's an extraordinary change .
let 's start with this .
one of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of soviet biological weapons testing .
but let 's bring it home .
we also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture .
it 's more than all our electricity .
and yet , we do n't talk about it very much .
so we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet , whether it 's 40 percent of our land surface , 70 percent of the water we use , 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions .
so without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we 're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
now , this would require nutrients and water .
plants need water and nutrients .
`` ( music ) ( `` '' institute on the environment , university of minnesota : driven to discover '' '' ) ( music ) ( `` '' the world population is growing by 75 million people each year . ''
today , we 're nearing 7 billion people .
and we all need food .
population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources .
more than 40 % of earth 's land has been cleared for agriculture .
that 's almost the size of south america .
that 's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry , or from all the world 's planes , trains and automobiles .
there is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture .
we need everyone at the table .
advocates of commercial agriculture , environmental conservation , and organic farming ...
for many millennia , humans have been on a journey to find answers , answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence , about who we are and why we are , and of course , who else might be out there .
might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans ?
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
for millennia , we 've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there 's intelligent life out there .
now , we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is , rather than ask what should be , believed .
seti does n't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence ; it merely notes the possibility , if not the probability in this vast universe , which seems fairly uniform .
the numbers suggest a universe of possibilities .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that 's 10 trillion .
so , there are many possibilities .
it 's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization .
so , one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos .
but this is a simple signal , and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .
the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust , to build an environment where raw data could be stored , and where it could be accessed and manipulated , where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .
and then , we 'd like to augment the automated search with human insight .
how do you do that ?
i do n't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there .
but it 's not really what is probably most efficient .
and then finally , a point that you do n't think of so much in developed world medicine : it eliminates sharps .
it just — you do n't want to do that .
you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort .
so , it works very well there , but it does n't work very well when you need more quantitative information .
there are also dipsticks , but if you look at the dipsticks , they 're for another kind of urine analysis .
there are an awful lot of colors and things like that .
the wax printer does what looks like printing .
the printers cost 800 bucks now .
they 'll make , we estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day they 'd make about 10 million tests a year .
and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see .
`` he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in india and saying , `` '' have you taken your dapsone ? '' '' `` `` yes . '' '' `` have you taken it every day ? '' `` yes . '' ''
`` and the colors indicate `` '' disease '' '' or `` '' normal . '' '' but even that 's complicated , because to you , to me , colors might indicate `` '' normal , '' '' but , after all , we 're all suffering from probably an excess of education . ''
and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dramatic flourish , and out comes the universal solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . in this particular case , a camera phone .
they 're everywhere , six billion a month in india .
and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that .
this is one : one of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum .
it works really , really well .
6:20 .
oh , my goodness . so , looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out — as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in — was , for these guys , quite a revelation .
very small example of something that they could do .
i thought that was a really , really nice example .
so there 's a whole series of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities .
why do we all follow the line in the street ?
people consciously follow things even though , why , we do n't know .
we co-opt other experiences — we take one item and transfer it to another .
a friend of mine was a designer at ikea , and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children .
this is the billy bookcase — it 's ikea 's biggest selling product .
so , what came out of this ?
so what is this ? i hear you all ask . no , i do n't .
and i think that 's what this is very much about .
last section : green armband . we 've all got them .
it 's about this really .
and , again , as designers , we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form .
when you put yourself in the position of these people , things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle , become much more relevant than the form of it . the way it 's produced , it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials .
it 's turning these guys — again , one of the themes — it 's turning them into entrepreneurs .
we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start , no pun intended , their next project .
he 'd just been diagnosed with als , which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years .
because , as we all know here today , it does n't work very well .
all of our statuses are different .
all of our hopes and dreams , what we want to accomplish , is different , and our paths will be different , they are all stories .
so , the first set of pathologies , they end up in the stick man on his icon , but the rest of them are really what 's important here .
because steven , despite the fact that he was paralyzed , as he was in that pool , he could not walk , he could not use his arms — that 's why he had the little floaty things on them , did you see those ? — he was happy . we were at the beach , he was raising his son , and he was productive .
but it 's not a data point at that one moment in time .
it is a data point of steven in a context .
and we convert that information into this structure , this understanding , this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable , to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered .
we did this for als . we can do this for depression , parkinson 's disease , hiv .
these are not simple , they are not internet scalable ; they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease .
here is an m.s . patient .
look at this hiv patient down here , zinny .
here they are . it 's an open network , everybody is sharing . we can see it all .
and here is data on 15,000 people 's current anxiety , right now .
and i want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years .
`` and we worked hard , and we thought about it and we said , `` '' what 's something we can use all the time , that we can use in the medical care system , that everyone will understand ? '' '' so , the patients print it out , because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network . ''
this is a journal , pnas — i think it 's the proceedings of the national academy of science of the united states of america .
this is a report about a drug called lithium .
lithium , that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder , that a group in italy found slowed als down in 16 patients , and published it .
now , we 'll skip the critiques of the paper .
here 's the implication of what happens .
`` i want to know now . can you help us ? '' '' so , we launched some tools , we let them track their blood levels . ''
`` can we find out what 's going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? '' '' so , we did . we took all the patients like humberto , that 's the apple background , we stole that because we did n't have time to build our own . this is a real app by the way . ''
`` and then we say , `` '' well how do we line them all up ? '' '' so , we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points , integrated across everything we know about the patient . ''
these are all the patients that started lithium .
terrifyingly accurate matching .
and i put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna , in his lumbar cord , and filled out the irbs and did all this work , and i never really knew .
and some of them were available . so , we hired one .
( laughter ) we hired them , set them up , assisting at lab .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
we have to go talk to him . because i 'd like to know what happened .
but my brother did n't . my brother went straight down the line .
first time we ever tried it . we 'll try to get it better later but 12 months so far .
and i found a woman that had — we found her , she was odd because she had data after she died .
so there was no job , no food .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
that 's their house .
until they identify this case , we 'll never release him .
pm : you 're running a medical clinic .
i admired them , and i decided to become a doctor .
my mother died in [ a ] gynecology complication , so i decided to become a gynecology specialist .
that 's why i became a doctor .
so it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s — that 's what made us go back and work for them .
and when i saw the people who needed me , i was staying with them to help , because i [ could ] do something for them .
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
dm : she 's very tough ; it 's most challenging .
and really when you think [ you ] can not do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
pm : but you do it for good reasons .
dm : thank you .
he collected all kinds of case studies .
`` ( music ) ( video ) stephen bradley : i thought i saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appearing to say to me , `` '' come . '' '' the next day i rejoiced with trembling . ''
others overcome their self at raves .
jh : so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out , or melt away , and it feels good , it feels really good , in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives .
it feels somehow uplifting .
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
i 'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human .
darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves , but they 're of great use to our groups .
within this team there 's competition .
maybe one of them will make it to the olympics .
so within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other .
the main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooperators , but as soon as you have a group of cooperators , they 're just going to get taken over by free-riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .
there 's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .
it takes advantage of the others .
so here 's how things play out .
and nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat .
it happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , primitive nests , or hives .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
this is why politics is so tribal .
nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
a few years after that , in bangalore , i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night , and i picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
so it took me from places like chile — the atacama desert in chile — to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors .
the reason why they have to work in winter is because they do n't have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and submersibles to do their work .
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter .
i still do n't understand this one russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
this is cosmology 's final frontier .
i was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight , which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere , the upper stratosphere , 40 km up .
the weather , as you can imagine , this is summer , and you 're standing on 200 ft of ice .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
( video ) radio : okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
and both require silence of some sort .
right now , they are under the skin , but in the future , they wo n't have to be implanted .
this is now a little tiny patch .
this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
`` here are some things , the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind : `` '' a data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better , faster , and stronger . living by numbers . '' '' and this one , which is really telling , this was from july , this cover article : `` '' the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise . it 's about tracking every facet of life , from sleep to mood to pain , 24/7/365 . '' '' well , i tried this device . ''
i did n't have one of those , but i got the fitbit .
the only thing it really tracks by itself is activity , and even then , it 's not complete .
`` how long did you do it for ? '' '' ( laughter ) and it says , `` '' how hard was it ? '' '' ( laughter ) furthermore it says , `` '' start time . '' '' now , this does n't appear — this just does n't work , i mean , this just does n't work . ''
this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
there 's over 650 wireless companies , 100 of which or more are working in wireless health .
and when you put that together with , for example , now an app for the iphone with your genotype to guide drug therapy ...
so half the earth 's internet population is using facebook .
so that 's the kind of thing that we do when we 're predicting stuff about you on social media .
so my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the proceedings of the national academies .
if you google this , you 'll find it .
it 's four pages , easy to read .
one of them is a sociological theory called homophily , which basically says people are friends with people like them .
we also know a lot about how information spreads through networks .
it turns out things like viral videos or facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks .
an example i often give is that , if i ever get bored being a professor , i 'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you 're a drug user , if you 're an alcoholic .
i could start that business tomorrow , and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that .
so one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path .
it 's sometimes said of facebook that the users are n't the customer , they 're the product .
`` and it 's actually very similar research that we 'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user , `` here 's the risk of that action you just took . '' ''
this is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective , and so scientists are going to be willing to do it .
one of the problems that people bring up when i talk about this is , they say , you know , if people start keeping all this data private , all those methods that you 've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail .
and so i think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward , as these tools evolve and advance , means that we 're going to have an educated and empowered user base , and i think all of us can agree that that 's a pretty ideal way to go forward .
we can cut violent deaths around the world by 50 percent in the next three decades .
there 's just one problem : these two scourges are still with us .
you all know the figures , right ?
so urban geographers and demographers , they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence , no .
são paulo , mexico city , took 15 to reach that same interval .
now , what do these medium , large , mega- , and hypercities look like ?
what we 're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge .
and tokyo ? it 's 46 .
the implications are disconcerting .
but as we 've heard so many times , these new technologies are dual-edged , right ?
some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens .
one way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones , kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices , of what works and what does n't .
take the case of são paulo , where i 've been working .
it 's gone from being brazil 's most dangerous city to one of its safest , and it did this by doubling down on information collection , hot spot mapping , and police reform , and in the process , it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years .
even my own group is involved in developing applications to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens .
but we need to be careful .
but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
goering was hitler 's second in command in world war ii , his designated successor .
van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death .
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
once van meegeren was on trial , he could n't stop talking .
i 'm a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?
it 's simple , you tell them they 're from mcdonald 's .
they believe mcdonald 's food is tastier , and it leads them to experience it as tastier .
you probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female .
people have murdered those that they loved , believing that they were murdering an imposter .
this was recorded in 1931 .
according to an unconfirmed report , a saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes .
if people want to get me something at the end of the conference , you could buy me a chagall .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery is n't .
who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?
okay . who here , it does nothing for them ?
the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 minutes ii into their house to film her painting .
and here 's a brief clip of this .
because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
so she 's stunned that he 's standing in a subway station .
the first shock hurts like hell .
it hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose .
and this is a big problem , particularly in hiv patients .
however , upon discontinuation of therapy , the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood .
it was the first time the story of stonewall had been told to a national audience .
traditionally , broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people , but i wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work , and see if we could give many , many , many people the chance to be listened to in this way .
in josh 's case , it 's with animals , so this is josh talking with his mom sarah at grand central nine years ago .
( video ) josh littman : from a scale of one to 10 , do you think your life would be different without animals ?
sl : well , i can understand why you think that people like amy more , and i 'm not saying it 's because of your asperger 's syndrome , but being friendly comes easily to amy , whereas i think for you it 's more difficult , but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much .
so many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness , courage , decency and dignity , and when you hear that kind of story , it can sometimes feel like you 're walking on holy ground .
today , more than 100,000 people in all 50 states in thousands of cities and towns across america have recorded storycorps interviews .
slowly and remarkably , they became friends , and when he was finally released from the penitentiary , oshea actually moved in next door to mary .
oshea israel : just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation .
you still believe in me , and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain i caused you , it 's amazing .
those are the key ingredients .
this is the picture of us at that interview .
he passed away very suddenly a few days later .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
`` and we expected huge masterpieces ! '' '' but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life , search , thought , everything — just in a reduced , small version . ''
so , we’ll go with the first piece .
woman : you do n't need me .
boy : what do you do all day ?
boy : look man , reading do n't feed no one .
boy : my fuckin ' reality .
marcus : with an ak-47 ?
director 1 : i saw his last film .
woman 2 : they suck ? what about yours ?
you make people fuckin ' sleep .
dream about bullshit .
i 've been away 20 years in total .
i 've lived in france for about four , and i feel actually thrown back 20 years , living in france .

state your name and age for the commission .
i am 15 or 16. i don’t remember .
( sister : 16 . ) cc : mr. gelehun , i’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed .
no .
one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers .
and considering where you are coming from , and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ?
great dreams are n't just visions , they 're visions coupled to strategies for making them real .
number two : we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem .
this is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype , which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal .
there 's no way that we 're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry .
probably the craziest sounding project we have is project loon .
but i promise you , you name it , we had to try it to get there .
so we 're going to keep going .
will people laugh at me ?
or , more specifically , what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video .
`` they 're responsible for this video , `` '' here it goes again . '' '' 50-million-plus views on youtube . ''
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
they wanted us to make use of the space .
so we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
and as if that was n't enough , all of these incredibly complicating things , right , they wanted it in one shot .
so , just some statistics about what we went through in the process .
and yet , a bowling ball will always follow the same path .
( laughter ) you know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .
so you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you do n't have to reset the whole thing .
let me start again .
( cheering )
`` what you just heard is `` '' skylife '' '' by david balakrishnan . ''
we want to play you one more selection .
it 's by astor piazzolla , an argentine composer .
and we talk about different ideas — he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart .
nevertheless , there are giants in the ocean , and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware .
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish .
now , this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense .
ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance — now you see me , now you do n't — and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
( applause ) ew : the full monty .
now , what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light , and that 's all dr. kubodera could see when the giant comes in here .
so , we 've made a whole series of instruments .
if you have n't seen it , it 's worth reading . he 's a pianist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples ' lives in unusual situations .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer 's can still respond to .
maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones , you can find somebody who ca n't recognize their face in the mirror , or ca n't tell anyone in their family , but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing . and with that you can bring back parts of people 's memories and personalities .
i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on .
to get their hands on music , to shape it themselves , change it , to experiment with it , to make their own music .
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly .
everybody can experience music in a profound way , we just have to make different tools .
i think that 's true for many of us , and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have , from ourselves to the outside world .
so , he figures out a way to download himself into his environment , actually into a series of books .
every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument , like this chandelier . it takes up the whole stage . it looks like a chandelier , but it 's actually a robotic music instrument .
every single book is robotic , so they all move , they all make sound , and when you put them all together , they turn into these walls , which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers . so he 's disappeared , but the whole physical environment becomes this person .
this is a sneak preview .
so instead of being grand opera , this opera will turn into what we 're thinking of as personal opera .
i think that this is the future of interface , it 's the future of music , the future of instruments .
he 's very shy , too .
he makes his own cds . actually , he is quite well known in the boston area — mentors people at the hospital and children , locally , in how to make their own music .
but , then was the really interesting aspect of the work , following the engineering part , where , basically , we 're coding over dan 's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out , you know , how does dan move ?
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
there 's this constant cacophony of noise .
some things actually do stick out .
for example , this here is a big bird , a rhinoceros hornbill .
this buzzing is a cicada .
it has to be simple , it has to be scalable , and so what we also noticed while were there was that everything we needed was already there .
but in fact , this is the little-known fact that i did n't realize at the time : deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world 's planes , trains , cars , trucks and ships combined .
also , according to interpol , as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging , like the illegal logging that we saw .
the moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest , the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw , it sends an alert through the standard gsm network that 's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging .
well , to test it , we took it back to indonesia , not the same place , but another place , to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging .
so — thank you . ( applause ) word of this spread , possibly because we told a lot of people , and in fact , then some really amazing stuff started to happen .
what we saw was that people throughout asia , people throughout africa , people throughout south america , they told us that they could use it too , and what 's most important , what we 'd found that we thought might be exceptional , in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service .
through my work i 'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
as an iceberg melts , i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
that 's about a 15-foot boat .
late in january 1975 , a 17-year-old german girl called vera brandes walked out onto the stage of the cologne opera house .
then the producer came over to vera and said ...
this one had this harsh , tinny upper register , because all the felt had worn away .
he went and sat outside in his car , leaving vera brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano .
but also , because the piano was so quiet , he had to set up these rumbling , repetitive riffs in the bass .
of course , i think any of us , in any remotely similar situation , would feel the same way , we 'd have the same instinct .
but jarrett 's instinct was wrong , and thank goodness he changed his mind .
so let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology , from complexity science , from social psychology , and of course , rock 'n ' roll .
now , these are really ugly fonts , and they 're difficult fonts to read .
but i think it 's time for us to think about what we count .
so i spent time with vivian , and i saw that she did n't find joy in cleaning toilets .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber .
what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests .
`` and i 'd write them back , and i 'd say , `` '' what a minute . we 're not french . ''
`` we 're an american company . we 're based in san francisco . '' '' and i 'd get a terse response : `` '' oh , that 's worse . '' '' ( laughter ) so one particular day when i was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre , i ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices . ''
and that 's what i did a few years ago when i took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of maslow 's hierarchy of needs .
for example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?
the teenage king of bhutan was also a curious man , but this was back in 1972 , when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind .
`` most world leaders did n't take notice , and those that did thought this was just `` '' buddhist economics . '' '' but the king was serious . ''
we create the conditions for happiness to occur .
`` in other words , we create a habitat of happiness . '' '' wow , that 's interesting . ''
how many know him ? anybody ?
( laughter ) the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out — an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
`` actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many dictionaries define pursuit as to `` '' chase with hostility . '' '' do we pursue happiness with hostility ? ''
co-branding opportunities .
this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
( applause ) certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
we 're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
we 're asking 10 simple questions — it is simplicity .
that 's about it .
i guess i 'm sort of a curious ceo .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
why is it that business leaders and investors quite often do n't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business ?
we count on people .
and then the anxiety set in .
the next day i started with the medications and the therapy .
depression is so exhausting .
then he would have a week of going downhill .
those are the things that i feel sad about now .
and the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you — it scares the hell out of me .
i stumbled into the hospital and right away there 's a gentleman , harold , 68 years old , came to the emergency department .
the attending physician directed me to go share with harold and his family the diagnosis , the prognosis and options of care .
`` and after a while i said , `` '' harold , what is it that has meaning to you ? ''
if we extrapolate this out over the next two decades with the growth of baby boomers , at this rate it is 60 percent of the gdp .
it has at stake the free-market economy and capitalism of the united states of america .
how can this be ?
how can we treat this without understanding this ?
our group , palliative care , in 2012 , working with the sickest of the sick — cancer , heart disease , lung disease , renal disease , dementia — how did we improve patient experience ?
quality of life , enhanced .
think about the human being .
and it 's a phone call or two a week , but he 's thriving in the context of end-stage lung disease .
how did we get this far without empowering somebody to know what it is they 're dealing with , and then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings to know if that is what we should do ?
there was a seminal article out of the new england journal of medicine in 2010 .
end-stage lung cancer : one group with palliative care , a similar group without .
if palliative care were a cancer drug , every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it .
we need to shift today so that we can live tomorrow .
so what follows from that is that if you think it 's all about money — you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money — you 're going to have a pretty miserable time .
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
a simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we 're in a world of people control .
so , complete transparency will make a huge difference .
we 're going to make every contract — we 're announcing this today — available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are , what the conditions are , driving huge value for money , but also huge increases , i believe , in well-being as well .
we 're working with some of these people .
let me just give you one example that i think is incredibly simple , and i love .
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .
that sort of behavioral economics can transform people 's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government can not possibly achieve .
`` and it is robert kennedy 's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little : it `` '' does not allow for the health of our children , the quality of their education , or the joy of their play . ''
stepping onto the sidewalk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
my son still had his dad .
and besides , it 's not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight .
these outsights ranged from the trival to the profound , from the mundane to the humorous .
as an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself .
paramount amongst those was the realization that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind .
and then i was also surprised by the city 's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses , things that you would otherwise maybe ignore .
some of it 's helpful . a lot of it 's kind of reversed .
( laughter ) it 's like , there was no escape from this man 's death grip , but he got me safely there .
`` `` bless you , man . '' ''
`` `` god bless you . '' ''
it 's a different way of thinking about it , but i think it 's kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it 's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .
and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities , and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast .
in fact , cars , who needs them ?
buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
and today , architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
given the amount of time that we spend indoors , it 's important to understand how this affects our health .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you 'll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you 're outdoors .
it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit .
it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states .
( applause )
all of this happens in seconds .
a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day .
both my wife and i were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites .
we called the project cyark , which stands for cyber archive .
let me show you some of them : chichen itza , rapa nui — and what you 're seeing here are the cloud of points — babylon , rosslyn chapel , pompeii , and our latest project , mt . rushmore , which happened to be one of our most challenging projects .
and so this is not a video .
and of course the data can be used to develop 3d models that are very accurate and very detailed .
it 's used for studies , for visualization , as well as for education .
let me close with another short story .
well , i 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you
( laughter ) the two wizards that i have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen .
so you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes .
let 's give them a hand .
the other is called the lester election .
okay . that 's lesterland .
number one , the united states is lesterland .
the united states is lesterland .
i do n't mean any criminal act .
so the right wants smaller government .
`` if we deregulate these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? '' '' this is a system that 's designed to save the status quo , including the status quo of big and invasive government . ''
it works against the left and the right , and that , you might say , is good news .
but here 's the bad news .
i can only find cheese . i 'm sorry . so there it is .
but we can not ignore this corruption anymore .
each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us .
so it 's fair to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?
but i do n't buy it .
it 's solvable , not by being a democrat , not by being a republican .
`` and i imagined a doctor coming to me and saying , `` '' your son has terminal brain cancer , and there 's nothing you can do . ''
i 'm going off to build google glass .
`` when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in september of 1787 , he was stopped in the street by a woman who said , `` mr. franklin , what have you wrought ? '' ''
so before i start , i want to talk about a little anecdote , a little story about a man i met once in mumbai .
they have figured out everything that 's required to dismantle , take things apart , rewrite the circuitry , re-flash the firmware , do whatever you want to with the phone , and they can fix anything so quickly .
it 's not taught in universities .
believe me , those little classrooms are really noisy .
so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device .
bruno giussani : like this , works ?
( applause ) so , very briefly , i 'll just explain to you how this is done , because that 's the more interesting part .
to most of you , this is a device to buy , sell , play games , watch videos .
i think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
it might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
and the secret is she opens every single one .
he told me not to tell anyone .
there 's something in new york city .
and then they started crime mapping .
there is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape — no census .
imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
if you do n't like the 24/7 all kardashian all the time programming , you 've got to stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian 's sideboob .
you 're about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
so what 's superhydrophobic ?
and we 're talking really small here .
so very small , but very useful .
it 's a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
you can see the difference .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
it could be anything that 's anti-icing , because if you do n't have water , you do n't have ice .
again , i will go through them as fast as possible .
well , you have to remember that tv was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal .
`` and then when you finally see where it is , then you 've got to move it to get the cursor over there , and then — `` '' bang '' '' — you 've got to hit a button or do whatever . ''
that 's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion — or one-and-a-half , depending on how you want to count .
and we have never known how to do this technically , so this slide is a fake slide .
what we did stumble across was something ...
and what you can do — oops , i did n't mean to do that — what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously could n't be presented before .
filmmakers , for example , are the experts in monologue making : you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning , middle and end , and in some sense the art of it is that .
what i 'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there , but you have to keep a few things in mind .
`` and then for a real beginner , you would go down even further and elaborate more — say , `` '' open the oven , preheat , wait for the light to go out , open the door , do n't leave it open too long , put the penguin in and shut the door ... '' '' ( laughter ) whatever . ''
nn : this is about the oil pan , or the oil filter and all that .
i can get back to the illustration , but in this case it 's not a single frame , but it 's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that 's described in the text .
the two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
( laughter ) ok. i 'm at the third and last part of this , which i said i would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment .
there is a myth , and it truly is a myth : we believe — and i 'm sure a lot of you believe in this room — that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak .
and in fact , it 's a powerful educational instrument .
this student was one of our first students , and it 's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard , and she came ... within two days — i want to show you the program she wrote , and remember her hairstyle . and that is the program she made .
and the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation : you had five people at five different sites — they were known people — and you had to have these people in teleconference , such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
and the fact that we knew the people — we had to take a page out of the history of walt disney — we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people 's faces .
so if i wanted to call my friend peter sprague on the phone , my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk , ( laughter ) and that would be the tv used for the occasion .
`` and when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say , `` '' he or she would n't agree , '' '' and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial . ''
and there are a number of schemes , which i do n't want to dwell on , but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face — literally in the face of the person .
so if i , all of a sudden , turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person , then at the person to my right 's site , he 'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .
you are responsible for the lives of hundreds of men and women , and your base is under attack .
incoming mortar rounds are exploding all around you .
now close your eyes .
he watched as a corpsman passed him over , declaring him a goner , and then leaving him to die .
but at night i would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall .
we 've had various names for post-traumatic stress throughout the history of war : homesickness , soldier 's heart , shell shock , thousand-yard stare , for instance .
after working for a few years on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit , i eventually transferred to the national intrepid center of excellence , nicoe , which leads tbi care for active duty service members .
that was a real experience for one of my patients , and when he created his mask , he was able to let go of that haunting image .
philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy .
and for the first time in 23 years , i could actually talk about stuff openly to , like , anybody .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
the question is n't whether or not i know you .
the economies of the future depend on that .
we can reach them . there are paths that enable us to reach them .
security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks , keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations .
a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance , where at any given point in time , with any single person , i am both close and distant from that individual , all as a function of what i need to do right now .
so jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness , and it 's a problem faced not just by individuals today , but also by organizations , organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities .
with distributed groups of people ?
i believe that mars is the most likely target for life outside the earth .
i 'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on mars .
viking was developed and managed at the nasa langley research center .
we had four spacecraft , two around mars , two on the surface — an amazing accomplishment .
( laughter ) this is olympus mons .
is there water on mars ?
this is my favorite picture . this was just taken a few weeks ago .
mars had rivers , mars had lakes , but more important mars had planetary-scale oceans .
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
( laughter ) this is a map that shows where we 've put our spacecraft on the surface of mars .
we asked this question 10 years ago .
this airplane was designed at the langley research center .
how do we transport an airplane to mars ?
how do we get it to mars ?
video : seven , six . green board . five , four , three , two , one .
we believe that in a one-hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on mars by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gases of biogenic origin , looking for gases of volcanic origin , studying the surface , studying the magnetism on the surface , which we do n't understand , as well as about a dozen other areas .
and , of equal importance is , we test ares in the earth 's atmosphere , at 100,000 feet , which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we 'll fly .
we do our tests at 100,000 feet .
it 's a large effort . it 's all at nasa langley research center .
so , i 'm graduating college and , feeling very idealistic , i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union .
in fact , some of them actually survived the internet challenge , and some got even more repressive .
that is , promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed .
( laughter ) but this is rarely a good sign . right ?
and , again , this is happening quite often .
they do n't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime .
i mean , anyone who has been to russia would know that there was no planning in russia for the next month .
they may have become slower , but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states .
and it 's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .
now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page .
so it does play a social role , however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement .
`` it 's going to be pornography , `` '' sex and the city , '' '' or maybe watching funny videos of cats . ''
so this is something you have to recognize .
( applause )
would we see 544 greyhound bus drivers ?
we are more dependent on it now than ever .
[ $ 60.2 billion ] now why is this ?
they 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they do n't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the internet .
on the next table was a chinese guy , and in the crew room , it was entirely filipinos .
and when we got to pirate waters , down the bab-el-mandeb strait and into the indian ocean , the ship changed .
and that was also shocking , because suddenly , i realized , as the captain said to me , that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship .
what else does our sea blindness mask ?
light does n't penetrate beneath the surface of the water , so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound .
you can do it immediately , right ?
hold the hand like this , palm up .
i start here , palm down , you can follow .
so , that was the warming up .
now , i need an assistant .
and i will give my tribute to water .
i work with a special method to do it , quick . i work with
if a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he — before he deals the card . now , so i think , number three , i have arranged them in a full house .
i will explain later . one , two , three , four , five .
right ? you agree .
so here , i think i know about where the cards are .
( laughter ) ok .
direct in the right brain , that 's much better . and so — ( laughter ) — arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing .
now , you can carry this in your wallet , so ...
( laughter ) so , but here , and — is the camera getting too much ? no . ( laughter )
perfect .
now , i do it quicker , better .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
here , i will do the most difficult thing .
( audience : queen of hearts . ) lg : queen of ? queen of hearts .
zoe : the queen . lg : queen , yes .
i think we keep the queen here , yes .
they did n't ?
no ? ( audience : no , they 're all gone . ) lg : but you see the hand .
ah , good , good , good . but now .
( laughter ) yeah , good .
i liked it . now , a little more difficult .
one , two , three , four — yes , the camera got it ? five , six , seven , eight — ah — nine , 10 , the jack , jack of spades , queen of — i like that laugh , yeah ! good . queen .
so i find ...
( audience : armani . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : armani . ) ( laughter ) lg : it was after the blindfold .
i drop the cards and you — which size ?
so , in this case , i try to locate diamonds . i look at the cards , and ok .
yes , yes , ok .
so now — i always ask , why do i put myself in this position ?
go ahead . yeah , good . i like the empathy .
looks good , like batman . ow !
but i like her , yeah . i said , be a little tough .
so , what was the card ?
so now i have to improvise again .
lg : good . good . two — ( applause ) — thank you .
three — three of diamonds . yes !
yes ? zoe : yeah .
if — and then nine , right ?
nine ? yeah ? correct ?
yes ?
`` you bring in science , and it ruins the magic . '' '' now i 'm an arts graduate ; i love myth and magic and existentialism and self-loathing . ''
this is a wonderful thing .
that is a wonderful idea .
your consciousness , the you-ness of you , the me-ness of me — that gets this one go .
we have been mountains and apples and pulsars and other people 's knees .
that is a good thing .
unlike the occupants of the universe , the universe itself is not wasteful .
this is a wonderful thing .
understanding , to me , does not remove the wonder and the joy .
i have a son . his name is archie .
you house is in a terrible state .
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
i 'm sitting on a chair .
`` i had a friend tell me , `` '' do n't worry about how much you like the work you 're doing now . ''
it was that i would ask one simple question .
and i realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb , and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall , or no wall at all .
but the point is , it 's on us to figure that out , and we need a framework , we need a way to navigate through this .
why are you saying that ? open up a journal .
`` it 's kind of like in wall street 2 , if anybody saw that , the peon employee asks the big wall street banker ceo , `` '' what 's your number ? everyone 's got a number , where if they make this money , they 'll leave it all . '' '' he says , `` '' oh , it 's simple . more . '' '' and he just smiles . ''
roger bannister and the four-minute mile , it was a physical impossibility to break the four-minute mile in a foot race until roger bannister stood up and did it .
i 'm sitting there , and my buddy jonathan , who had talked me into it , he comes up to me and he could see the state i was in .
`` and he says , `` '' scott , hey man , what 's the worst that could happen ? ''
as i 'm finishing this swim , i get to aquatic park , and i 'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished , so they 're cheering me on and they 're all excited .
and he 's just flailing like this .
the fastest things to do things you do n't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them .
and there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner .
they change everything , and it 's a proven fact .
with 80 percent of people who do n't like the work they do , that means most people around us , not in this room , but everywhere else , are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings .
( applause ) and this is how badly i wanted it , it grew at zero percent for four years , and i was about to shut it down , and right about then , i moved to san francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure , of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way .
well , for four years , i knew nobody in this space , and i did n't even know it existed , that people could do this stuff , that you could have movements like this .
and then i 'm over here in san francisco , and everyone around me was doing it .
i just read in forbes , the us government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off .
and that 's already starting to happen .
what would that look like ?
as with many other important innovations , those radical ideas required no new technology , just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment , plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection .
as i watched him paint , dad taught me that art was not about being decorative , but was a different way of communicating ideas , and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight .
fortunately , my family also had engineers in it , and with my parents , these were my first role models .
then , when i was about nine years old , we went to rome .
and there was something about this place , i did n't know why , that just felt special .
and incidentally , it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that 's ever been built .
for example , here are some of the pantheon 's miracles .
my teachers told me that i had to get serious and focus on one or the other .
however , urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like michelangelo , leonardo da vinci , benjamin franklin , people who did exactly the opposite .
so then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the pantheon actually happen ?
the problem is , no matter how talented , rich or smart you are , you only get one to one and a half miracles .
however , by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution , they came up with a design that only works if there 's a big hole in the roof .
that done , you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light , cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens .
not bad .
so what came after the moon ?
it 's more like the invention of concrete : important , absolutely necessary to build the pantheon , and enduring , but entirely insufficient by itself .
so what is next ?
how can a fancy version of cruise control be profound ?
machine vision , special sensors , and high-performance computing can do a lot of this , but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board .
this con man , henry oberlander , he was such an effective con man , british authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the western world .
lying is an attempt to bridge that gap , to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were , how we wish we could be , with what we 're really like .
we 're essentially against lying .
extroverts lie more than introverts .
we parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we do n't understand the gaps in our lives .
well , there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
`` freud said , look , there 's much more to it than speech : `` '' no mortal can keep a secret . ''
now here 's the deal .
this mother , diane downs , shot her kids at close range , drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car , claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it .
and i do n't understand it , and i never will .
so one challenge we have is to remember , oversharing , that 's not honesty .
and that 's the truth . thank you .
`` hey . i wan na start today — talk about the structure of a polypeptide . ( laughter ) i get a lot of people asking me , in terms of `` '' lost , '' '' you know , `` '' what the hell 's that island ? '' '' you know , it 's usually followed by , `` no , seriously , what the hell is that island ? '' ( laughter ) ''
so thank you , if you 're here .
and one of the reasons he was amazing : after world war ii he began an electronics company .
to open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is .
`` i mean , i would call him , and i 'd be like , `` '' listen , grandpa , i really need this camera . ''
`` i 'll get invited to ted one day . this is like — `` '' ( laughter ) and you know , and my grandmother was the greatest . ''
this is the kind of thing . so it would be like , you know . right ?
there was no time to develop it .
the romance of the script was amazing to me ; it would inspire me .
and you 're full of that amazing — that feeling of excited anticipation .
`` `` '' lost '' '' ! i had no idea ! and i realized , holy shit , it 'd come full circle . ''
like , the inspiration i get from the technology is now using the stuff that i do , inspired by it , to sell technology . i mean , it 's nuts ! ( laughter ) i was gon na show you a couple of other things i 'm gon na skip through .
the most incredible sort of mystery , i think , is now the question of what comes next .
there 's that .
june 29 , 2016 .
i gather it scares you , too .
in this round , i sense that your fears of me , of the world that i have insisted is right for us both , has gathered over a generation .
i listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions and electing vulgar demagogues .
i now see as i did n't before that not having the right skin or right organ is not the only varietal of disadvantage .
`` language is one of the only things that we truly share , and i sometimes used this joint inheritance to obfuscate and deflect and justify myself ; to re-brand what was good for me as something appearing good for us both , when i threw around terms like `` '' the sharing economy , '' '' and `` '' disruption '' '' and `` '' global resourcing . '' '' i see now that what i was really doing , at times , was buying your pain on the cheap , sprucing it up and trying to sell it back to you as freedom . ''
but it will not be a cheap , shallow redemption that comes through blather about us all being in it together .
we have , for too long , chased various shimmering dreams at the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other , the dream of tending to each other , of unleashing each other 's wonders , of moving through history together .
and here are the dietary factors going head-to-head against these drugs .
that is the equivalent of what we face now .
all right , now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid , but look at these graphs that levin showed .
this graph shows the national debt as a percentage of america 's gdp , and as you see , if you go all the way back to the founding , we borrowed a lot of money to fight the revolutionary war .
now then we get the great depression and world war ii .
we 're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at world war ii , and the baby boomers have n't even retired yet , and when they do , this is what will happen .
so i 'm a social psychologist , and i study morality , and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds .
but then , after world war i , things dropped , and we get this historically low level of polarization .
so look at this data . this is from the american national elections survey .
so for a lot of reasons , those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time .
the politicians i 've met are generally very extroverted , friendly , very socially skillful people , and that 's the nature of politics . you 've got to make relationships , make deals , you 've got to cajole , please , flatter , you 've got to use your personal skills , and that 's the way politics has always worked .
they do n't meet each other 's spouses or children .
so there 's a lot we can do , but who 's going to push them to do it ?
no labels and common cause , i think , have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our congress more effective .
this means that there 's much less money coming into the house .
i do n't think so , because it happens , not all that often , but there are a variety of examples that point the way .
well , grover norquist is n't , because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money .
you ca n't do a thing about it .
`` since i 'm a product of this philosophy , of 90/10 , and secondly , `` '' life on an incline , '' '' that 's the way i grew up to be valuing what i got . ''
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
i 'm going to take you on two journeys , my policing journey and my prison journey .
i had other options , but i did n't choose them .
`` they sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , `` '' now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to . ''
and they did n't say anything .
this is a visual of education inside the prison .
i started this with community support .
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind .
apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors .
two smartphones from two of the biggest companies in the world ; one that protects data by default , and one that does n't .
but african-americans are also disproportionately likely to use android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance .
it 's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power .
modern social movements rely on technology — from black lives matter to the arab spring to occupy wall street .
but chances are , they 'll probably have a cheap , $ 20 android phone in their pocket .
so i wanted to ask you a personal question , which is : do you do that ?
this is used by criminals . this is used by stalkers .
if more money is invested in highways , of course there is less money for housing , for schools , for hospitals , and also there is a conflict for space .
`` and the second kind of equality is one which we could call `` '' democratic equality . '' '' the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law . ''
for example , if that is true , a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one .
we called it transmilenio , in order to make buses sexier .
a committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses .
( laughter ) and i was almost impeached in the process .
indeed , a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city , which is road space .
how to distribute it between pedestrians , bicycles , public transport and cars ?
in many developing country cities , more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades .
only 20 years later , between 1920 and 1930 , almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the united states .
and this changes the way people live , move , enjoy the city .
ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods do n't have cars .
this would be , again , a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start , low cost , pleasant transit with natural sunlight .
as a latin american , and latin america was the most recently organized region in the world , i would recommend , respectfully , passionately , to those countries which are yet to urbanize — latin america went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 — i would recommend asian and african countries which are yet to urbanize , such as india which is only 33 percent urban now , that governments should acquire all land around cities .
in this way , their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces , with the parks , with the greenways , with the busways .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that 's me .
good , really good , maybe an all-star .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who 's batting 200 on angioplasties .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
and i felt really good .
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came , paramedics came to take her home .
`` `` do you remember that patient you sent home ? '' ''
and it was what i was feeling .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that 's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and fortunately he did n't die .
he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
now in both cases , i did n't send them home and i do n't think there was any gap in their care .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
if i were to walk into a room — like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
and here 's the thing .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
she shares her experience with others .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
my name is brian goldman .
i 'm sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still do n't know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while , and that 's one of the example symptoms of it .
that means they can be self-administered .
tr : so you 're 86 percent accurate right now ?
but darwin does n't only explain the evolution of a single idea .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
in fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of sweden .
`` but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said , `` wow , that 's the chinese character for the word 'people . ' '' ( laughter ) so , apparently this is how you write `` '' people , '' '' as in the people 's republic of china . ''
and we had the chance to explain the project .
we also asked ourselves , what could denmark possibly show china that would be relevant ?
bicycles have become forbidden many places .
but in fact , the container ships go full of goods from china to denmark , and then they sail empty back .
and to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the chinese state censorship .
so for the first time , i got invited to speak at the national parliament .
and they form this sort of vertical backyard where , on a nice summer day , you 'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of 10 meters .
and because copenhagen is completely flat , if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view , you basically have to do it yourself .
then we sort of cut up the volume , so we would n't block the view from my apartment .
it 's actually a stand-up product from switzerland , because in switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators .
and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes , we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic , naturally ventilated , rasterized image .
they can actually have both .
unfortunately , it was the national bank of iceland .
so he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan .
and we made this small movie that i 'd like to show .
and this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains , in what 's going to be the first carbon-neutral island in central asia .
so in a way you can see how the mountain in copenhagen sort of evolved into the seven peaks of azerbaijan .
`` the cry of `` '' raw data now ! '' '' which i made people make in the auditorium , was heard around the world . ''
`` a classic story , the first one which lots of people picked up , was when in march — on march 10th in fact , soon after ted — paul clarke , in the u.k. government , blogged , `` '' oh , i 've just got some raw data . here it is , it 's about bicycle accidents . '' '' two days it took the times online to make a map , a mashable map — we call these things mash-ups — a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected . ''
look at zanesville , ohio .
it allows anybody to go there and burrow down .
well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a postcode — which is like a zip plus four — for a specific group of houses , you can make paper , print off a paper which has got very , very specific things about the bus stops , the things specifically near you .
here focusing in on haiti .
fortunately , just after the earthquake , geoeye , a commercial company , released satellite imagery with a license , which allowed the open-source community to use it .
it has a sense of your body , pain , hunger , orgasms .
right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
for much of the 20th century , that view held sway .
even 30 years ago , when ted got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness .
no knock on the neuroscientists .
right now , we do n't really have a bead on that .
it 'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams , like hurricanes , like life , and we 'll figure it out .
we 've got this wonderful , great chain of explanation , we 're used to it , where physics explains chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains parts of psychology .
faced with an anomaly like this , radical ideas may be needed , and i think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically .
now , there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be .
his crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
actually , all we 've got to do is explain the objective functions , the behaviors of the brain , and then we 've explained everything that needs to be explained .
in the 19th century , maxwell figured out that you ca n't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , newton 's laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern .
this opens up the way for you to do science with it .
every system might have some degree of consciousness .
this view is sometimes called panpsychism : pan for all , psych for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even rob knight 's microbes , elementary particles .
the idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking .
i mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
complex information processing , like in a human , complex consciousness .
a really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , giulio tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory .
the amount of information integration falls off , but it 's still non-zero .
well , on the panpsychist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness .
that 's what physics really is ultimately doing , describing the flux of consciousness .
now , if you 're a panpsychist and you take that view , you 're going to go very hungry .
`` what about the artificially intelligent system in the movie `` '' her , '' '' samantha ? ''
understanding consciousness is a real key , i think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves .
and the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died .
the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .
and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
you ought to read the label to find out where it came from , but it 's still cheap , and everybody thinks it 's okay .
the trophy fish were so big that you could n't put any of those small fish up on it .
we use nets that are 20 miles long .
think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away .
the green revolution , all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we use too much of it .
and another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .
well , the northwest passage is already there .
the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they 'll start to merge , and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global , coastal ocean .
that does n't sell .
as the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it 's warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
it 's not about the fish ; it 's not about the pollution ; it 's not about the climate change .
i also drove along the streets of amsterdam , again playing music by this same composer .
it started a couple of years ago .
and that is why i have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street , online , in the air : to feel that state of wonder , to truly listen , and to listen without prejudice .
ca : that was the good news . the bad news was that to do it , he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops . ( laughter ) em : i mean , you can certainly drive — if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reasonable number .
not at all a dig at the new york times , this , by the way .
and so this is something that maybe a lot of people do n't realize .
wait for an hour , but the good news is , you 're helping save the planet , and by the way , the electricity is free . you do n't pay anything .
if the sun was n't there , we 'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin , and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation .
ca : but you 're not selling solar panels to consumers .
it 's no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
em : exactly . what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility .
ca : all right , so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself , i guess , a kind of crazy bet .
and i really think there 's a fundamental difference , if you sort of look into the future , between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization , that 's out there exploring the stars , on multiple planets , and i think that 's really exciting , compared with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event .
the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket , but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time , and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight .
it 's much like on a jet .
so that 's just to give a sense of scale .
can we put it into our education system ? can someone learn from you ?
physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive , like quantum mechanics .
learn from this man .
em : thank you . ca : that was awesome . that was really , really cool .
i lie awake . i think thoughts . i walk aimlessly .
and i saw this really smart critic who i love .
and i said , how do i know about stalinism ?
so i do n't really know that . i do n't really — actually i do my own kind of research , you know .
people say , oh , do that . an astrologer tells me to do something .
so i do it .
so , you know , for years i would go to bars and , sort of , anyone i met whose name was eric i was humping immediately , or something .
`` `` '' he ate out , he saw shows , '' '' right ? ''
so you 'll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something .
and at least , you know , in my case , because if i just do one thing all the time , i do n't know , i get very , very bored . i bore very easily .
and you know , i do n't say that i do everything well , i just say that i do a lot of things , that 's all .
you do n't master feeling lousy about one thing .
yeah , exactly .
i will show you this next thing , speaking of costumes for operas .
i do n't know where it comes from .
and then performing arts high school .
and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
this is one of my favorite clips of rosie .
a : cutting hair ? never , never .
rod : no , but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first , i think .
im : are you freaking out ? you look so cute .
right ? and then i realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and i thought , oh , i said something , you know , in an interview .
and so i think that 's what it all boils down to .
im : you know what ? stop laughing . it 's not funny .
the liquid is actually that clear liquid .
and that 's what it was in the early days .
now , the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk .
we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs , medium-sized predatory dinosaurs , and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters .
these fossils were deposited in a river system .
but the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton .
thank you .
kurt andersen : like many architects , david is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent — or at least pretends to be — that he asked me to question him rather than speaking .
this was — out of all the tourist sites in new york city — this was her number-one pick .
to honor and remember .
tourist : it 's reality , it 's us . it happened here .
we gave the office a few days off .
and that was the mission that we came up with .
we took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists , and over four days — it was like this urban barn-raising — to renovate it , and everyone wanted to help .
ka : and that was done , effectively , by october 8 or something ?
dr : yeah .
and i sat in on several meetings .
ka : on the hudson river ?
and there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site .
dr : yeah . his initials are js , and he owns rockefeller center , if that helps anyone — volunteered to help .
and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together , watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul — which is just to the right — and moving around the site .
`` so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said , `` '' i 'm going to lock the door , because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this . '' '' and we said , `` '' well , this is half the size , it does n't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone — everyone in the city . ''
it seems to me with this , that it was the opposite of that .
it 's all incredibly humble material .
but the design was driven by a need to be quick , cheap , safe , respectful , flexible .
did that require , as an architect , a new way of thinking about what you were doing ?
so the notion of collaboration — i think this reinforces how important that is .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i 've been interested in before .
dr : and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas , where i think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses .
is this an opportunity , is the silver lining — a silver lining , here — to rebuild some more traditional city grid , or not ?
i do n't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces , regardless of what the number is .
ka : as you say , it 's not a memorial .
but were you conscious of memorials ? the vietnam memorial ?
the scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable .
from the dust , we pulled out bacterial cells , broke them open , and compared their gene sequences .
let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another .
`` i told tim , `` '' if you could just see the microbes , it 's kind of like being in costa rica . kind of . '' '' and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland . ''
if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building , you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another .
and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different .
and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns , it makes me think that it 's possible to tackle really challenging problems , like hospital-acquired infections .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape .
would n't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ?
( applause )
let 's first begin with a thought experiment .
and you observe a really strange effect .
and so , taking all of these different threads and putting them together , i asked , starting several years ago , is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads ?
intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open .
just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
for example , here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself , illustrating its potential for gaming .
in the next 18 minutes , i 'm going to take you on a journey .
so i 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn , and have been for the past two and a half years .
so like the equivalent , the titan equivalent , of tar , or oil , or what — we did n't know what .
`` it was a moving demonstration of what the words `` '' united nations '' '' are supposed to mean : a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good . ''
you are looking at a shoreline .
so , this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan . ( laughter ) and then finally , the probe came to rest on the surface , and i 'm going to show you , ladies and gentlemen , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system .
there 's hundreds , up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes .
so again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions .
so we have , possibly , liquid water , organic materials and excess heat .
right now , earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life .
`` the debate is over the proposition : `` '' what the world needs now is nuclear energy . '' '' true or false ? ''
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
and that would be very interesting in the developing world .
they 're referred to as nuclear batteries .
the governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive , and these will go ahead .
his team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources .
this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit .
iran is doing that right now .
that 's the footprint that is always being confused .
for example , cellulosic ethanol , to power the entire u.s. vehicle fleet , this is how much land you would need .
so then here 's the final ranking .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more .
in every case , they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power .
ca : mark , 30 seconds , either on that or on anything stewart said .
you can make it reliable , as i showed with that diagram .
i used to be against nuclear power .
david fanton : hi , i 'm david fanton . i just want to say a couple quick things .
i 've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that i own .
and so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible .
now , with regard to the resources , we 've developed the first wind map of the world , from data alone , at 80 meters .
so , people of the ted community , i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error .
therefore , we do n't find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy .
these women and those young men united iranians across the world , inside and outside .
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women .
given the scale that twitter is at , a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day .
the sheer scale of what we 're dealing with makes for a challenge .
the details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty .
we 'll start off easy .
seems pretty straightforward .
so why are the stakes higher for this ?
now , given the sorts of challenges i 'm up against , it 's crucial that i not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected .
so what do i do ?
there 's more in that picture than just a cat .
it 's the kind of complicated circle that i 'm going to tell you about .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago .
it 's 2,200 people in the year 2000 .
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
and i 'm about to show you a 30 second video animation that took me and james five years of our lives to do .
so , again , every dot is a person .
every tie between them is a relationship .
we 're going to put this into motion now , taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years .
and we used a variety of techniques to do this .
and , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
and that , in fact , if we really want to understand human emotions , we need to think about them in this way .
now , we 're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way , in simple , sort of , brief periods of time .
maybe there 's a kind of below the surface , quiet riot that animates us all the time .
so the friend of a friend of a 's is , back again , a friend of a 's , whereas the friend of a friend of b 's is not a friend of b 's , but is farther away in the network .
`` that 's my social experience . '' '' but now we , with a bird 's eye view looking at this network , can see that they occupy very different social worlds . ''
and i can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you : who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network ?
you 'd rather be d , on the edge of the network .
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days ?
so , similarly , the pattern of connections among people confers upon the groups of people different properties .
superorganisms have properties that can not be understood just by studying the individuals .
now , look at this .
this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
and actually , the structure of those tissues is quite different , and it 's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease , other conditions , in terms of how you 're going to regenerate your tissue , and you 're going to need to think about the materials you 're going to use really carefully , their biochemistry , their mechanics , and many other properties as well .
so it 's going to be very different from tissue to tissue .
and bone is actually quite good at repairing .
so what we do is , in humans , we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones .
and so you do get these kinds of contacts , and of course , being british and also growing up in france , i tend to be very blunt , and so i had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case , there probably was n't that much in there to protect in the first place .
so for other kinds of operations , there 's definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches .
and so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body .
what i mean here is that we 've started to define nature in a way that 's so purist and so strict that under the definition we 're creating for ourselves , there wo n't be any nature left for our children when they 're adults .
right ? like , we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet , and all the other plants , and all the other microbes .
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity , man or woman .
and when i got in there with my canoe , what did i find , but people .
they even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals .
all of a sudden , there 's nature all around us .
all of a sudden , we see this monarch caterpillar munching on this plant , and we realize that there it is , and it 's in this empty lot in chattanooga .
so to deal with this , the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park , even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness .
and in fact , i took a look , and banff national park is doing all of the things i just listed : suppressing fire , having fire , radio-collaring wolves , reintroducing bison .
you ca n't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere .
additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
so for now , it 's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of philadelphia , and if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence , you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of philadelphia .
for so long , we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash .
this forest here has queensland maple , it has sword ferns from southeast asia .
you can make your own novel ecosystem , too .
it 's really simple .
this never made any sense anyway .
which brings me to the second thing that we have to do , which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is untouched is unloved .
and i do n't want to be the one to tell this kid , who is on a special program that takes philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks , i do n't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he 's holding is a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash .
we secured equipment , funds , vehicles , we trained a team , we set up a hundred clinics throughout the great rift valley to try and understand a single question : why are people going blind , and what can we do ?
so we said , could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way ?
here in nakuru , where i 've been living , we can search for people by whatever condition .
those blue pins that drop represent elders , or local leaders , that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment .
so for patients like mama wangari , who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren , for less than 40 dollars , we can restore her eyesight .
and so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school , i started thinking about what i wanted to do , and just like probably most students , had no idea what that meant or what i wanted to do .
and i thought about so much about the soldiers who i eventually had to end up leading .
a lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons .
they signed up because of a sense of obligation .
their family said this was important .
they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge .
and now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts .
and i just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers .
but i really had no idea what that even meant .
but i had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
when i first came back from afghanistan , i thought that if you make it back from conflict , then the dangers were all over .
it plays out in all of our memories .
i wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
because sometimes there 's this fear and there 's this apprehension that if i say anything , i 'm afraid i 'll offend , or i 'm afraid i 'll trigger something , so the common default is just saying nothing .
the fact is , we have literally 2.6 million men and women who are veterans of iraq or afghanistan who are all amongst us .
sometimes we know who they are , sometimes we do n't , but there is that feeling , the shared experience , the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life , while it might be closed , it 's still not over .
`` we think about `` '' thank you for your service , '' '' and people say , `` '' so what does 'thank you for your service ' mean to you ? '' '' well , `` '' thank you for your service '' '' means to me , it means acknowledging our stories , asking us who we are , understanding the strength that so many people , so many people who we serve with , have , and why that service means so much . ''
he comes back and instead of deciding that , well , now since i 've lost my leg , that second dream is over , he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball , and he starts this group called vetsports , which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing .
these are the people who i served with , and these are the people who i honor .
and this is sultanbelyi , which is one of the largest squatter communities in istanbul .
and if you do the math , that 's 130 people every minute .
so , these are the cities of the future , and we have to engage them .
`` so — `` '' the hut was made of corrugated metal , set on a concrete pad . ''
they did have electricity , but it was illegal service tapped from someone else 's wires , and could only power one feeble bulb .
this was southland , a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi , kenya .
`` `` '' after we finished , armstrong straightened his tie , put on a wool sports jacket , and we headed out into the glare . ''
it was perhaps eight feet tall , 40 feet long , and 10 feet wide .
`` `` '' for armstrong , southland was n't constrained by its material conditions . ''
'this place is very addictive , ' he had said .
the crud in the front is mattress stuffing , and you see that all over turkey .
so , that 's just a rock in the hillside .
this is commerce in kenya , right along the train tracks , so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way .
so , the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village , to the more developed city , to the even highly developed sultanbelyi ?
one is people need a guarantee they wo n't be evicted .
that can mean community organizing from below , but it can also mean possibilities from above .
he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood , and the people in the neighborhood , and is a great resource in the community .
`` i got to the airport , to the hotel , checked in , and , sitting there in the lobby , was a brochure for the sydney festival . i thumbed through it , and i came across a show called `` '' minto : live . '' '' the description read : `` '' the suburban streets of minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of minto . '' '' what was this place called minto ? ''
i have to say , it was n't exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
lone twin had come to minto and worked with the residents , and they had created these dances .
they can transform cities and communities .
modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of world war ii .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we have n't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour .
`` she had gathered with others to watch 'the sultan 's elephant , ' and , you know , it just made all the difference . '' '' lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model . ''
thank you very much . ( applause )
i try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate .
there we go . all right .
so here are pictures of myself .
and i remember reading that book , and at 3 in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas i was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate , to send bits of information from one star system to another .
but drake 's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and i 'll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment , which did n't succeed , we have been doing seti ever since , not continuously , but ever since .
but something that 's not appreciated by the public is , in fact , that the experiment continues to get better , and , consequently , tends to get faster .
this is a little plot , and every time you show a plot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
in other words , we 're looking for a needle in a haystack .
in fact , it 's doubling every 18 months , and , of course , every card-carrying member of the digerati knows that that 's moore 's law .
so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years , we 'll be able to look at a million star systems , a million star systems , looking for signals that would prove somebody 's out there .
we do n't know the answer to that either , but we will learn that answer this year , thanks to nasa 's kepler space telescope , and in fact , the smart money , which is to say the people who work on this project , the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand , one in a hundred , something like that .
and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you : either we 're going to find e.t . in the next two dozen years , or i 'll buy you a cup of coffee .
now , i might be at ground zero for this .
`` i happen to know what the consequence for me would be , because we 've had false alarms . this is 1997 , and this is a photo i made at about 3 o'clock in the morning in mountain view here , when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought , `` '' this is the real deal . '' '' all right ? ''
and the answer is that we do n't know the answer .
now , you might find that a bit hyperbolic , and maybe it is , but nonetheless , it 's conceivable that this will happen , and , you know , you could consider this like , i do n't know , giving julius caesar english lessons and the key to the library of congress .
it can address the problem by getting young people interested in science . look , science is hard , it has a reputation of being hard , and the facts are , it is hard , and that 's the result of 400 years of science , right ?
in the 19th century , if you had a basement lab , you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home . right ? because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up .
today , you 've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are .
so that 's one thing . the other thing is , it 's exciting science .
i mean , this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth . right ?
they get interested in something .
so , all right , i give talks to adults , that 's fine , but i try and make 10 percent of the talks that i give , i try and make those for kids .
`` in fact , my last comments to these kids , at the end i said , `` '' you know , you kids are smarter than the people i work with . '' '' now — ( laughter ) they did n't even care about that . ''
in another generation down the line , i think we will have succeeded .
just 25 years ago , the developing countries , the poorer countries of the world , were , notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people , they accounted for only about a third of the world 's output .
that 's a remarkable change .
it means that most countries around the world , rich or poor , are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that i want to talk about and highlight .
now , the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that i 've already begun to illustrate through the description of beijing .
if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way , we will create waste , pollution , congestion , destruction of land and forests .
you ca n't negotiate with the laws of physics .
the cities that already are there , well established , we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities , and make it easier , encourage more people , to live closer to the center .
we 've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that .
again , breathing was a hazardous activity .
take the example of california .
it shows what can be done .
you 're seeing what can be done .
we need leaders to step up .
( applause )
growing up in the hot last vegas desert , all i wanted was to be free .
and best of all , i thought , i can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack . ( laughter ) and i did !
i was so shocked , i was just as shocked as everybody else , and i was so discouraged , but i knew that if i could find the right pair of feet that i would be able to do this again .
it was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift i could ever receive — a new kidney from my dad — that allowed me to follow my dreams again .
it 's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head-on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits .
i 'm here today to talk about social change , not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that , but a new business model for social change , a new way of tackling the problem .
and how many previous times do you think they 've been in prison ?
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely compelling .
now , many of you may have noticed there 's a problem at this point , and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened .
so we have to raise some money .
they 're going to have to care in the social program , but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years , then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product .
well , the first piece , which we 've talked about , is innovation .
by working to outcomes , people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one 's dealing with .
there is , at the moment , a stale debate going on very often : state 's better , public sector 's better , private sector 's better , social sector 's better , for a lot of these programs .
with this kind of model , we can help bring them together .
i 'd like you to imagine this place .
these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil .
i was part of a team of researchers from university college london , on a grant from the u.k. department of health .
what lay at the root of their behavior ?
and i suppose that 's how i found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at wormwood scrubs .
joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression .
normally , the more empathic a person is , the larger and more active their amygdala is .
at the age of six months , virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects .
at first , this is n't perfect .
it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness .
in order to understand how this process works , i left the psychopaths and joined a lab in oxford specializing in learning and development .
instead of psychopaths , i studied mice , because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals .
it is now clear that the amygdala of mammals , including primates like us , can show neurogenesis .
the more stress , the less brain development , which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels .
this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration .
how can we apply this knowledge ?
it 's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high-security inmate in an mri scanner .
will he be among the 70 percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system ?
and finally i ended up encountering psychology by chance .
i was at a ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself , because the snow had melted and i did n't have money to go to a movie . but i found that on the — i read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that i 'd seen in the center of zurich , and it was about flying saucers [ that ] he was going to talk .
instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war , and now they 're projecting flying saucers into the sky .
and i started reading his books after that lecture .
this is a typical result that many people have presented , and there are many variations on it .
but this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the united states since 1956 say that their life is very happy .
and that has n't changed at all .
in fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness .
and it 's interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement — whether it 's china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the mayas , or egyptians — what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life .
these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form .
now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out .
you do n't think ; it goes automatically , if you merge yourself with the music , and so forth .
you see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
this is an interesting little quote from masaru ibuka , who was at that time starting out sony without any money , without a product — they did n't have a product , they did n't have anything , but they had an idea .
and the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart 's content .
if we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average .
relaxation is fine — you still feel ok .
and that is the kind of challenge that we 're trying to understand .
it 's like , on facebook , you have friends only from — it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook .
`` it 's not just one dude making one poster , it 's — we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , `` '' make me a poster . post it . ''
so you can see they are still shy , they do n't want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i do n't know , commented on one of the photos .
and at some point , you become friends on facebook , and you become friends in life .
i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . and we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball .
and it goes the other way around .
crazy , yes ?
`` and i 'm just going to take a picture of it , and i 'm just going to post it on facebook with kind of `` '' israelis for peace '' '' or something . ''
oh my god .
and then will come what they call the heart , the lush heart note .
everything that you’re smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table — a nice , safe neighborhood .
some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts , and it didn’t really work .
this smells of cut grass . now , this is the skeleton of the molecule .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
in other words , i’ve taken off-the-shelf components , and i’ve made a spectroscope .
so nobody likes particularly to — you know , aftershave with carcinogens .
( laughter ) there are some reckless people , but it’s not worth it , ok ?
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
the deck was the size of a cargo bed of a ford f-150 pickup truck .
this would be her route : over 3,600 miles across the open north atlantic ocean .
( video ) tmm : do you guys have a weather report , over ?
( video ) tmm : just sprained my ankle .
i 'm in something big , bad and ugly .
in 1998 , i was a high school student living in louisville , kentucky .
she was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization .
`` she sings this song . it 's called `` '' dear heart . '' '' ( guitar ) when i was dreaming , i took my body to beautiful places i 'd never been . ''
and when i awoke here , the sky was so cloudy .
but the key to eradicating polio is early detection , early response .
but we need to have early detection , early response .
i hope that you will take a look at it .
you usually arrive right about here .
now , the people here in rio mostly know vila cruzeiro from the news , and unfortunately , news from vila cruzeiro often is not good news .
but vila cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins .
now , we learned that favelas are informal communities .
where we 're from , in holland , everything is planned .
jk : we had a friend .
he ran an ngo in vila cruzeiro .
`` so the local news started writing about it , which was great , and then even the guardian wrote about it : `` notorious slum becomes open-air gallery . '' ''
we figured that our ideas , our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time .
and instead of looking for funding , we started a crowdfunding campaign , and in a little over a month , more than 1,500 people put together and donated over 100,000 dollars .
we picked this spot in vila cruzeiro , and houses are being plastered as we speak .
jk : so the favela was not only the place where this idea started : it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan , because these communities are informal — this was the inspiration — and in a communal effort , together with the people , you can almost work like in an orchestra , where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony .
most of us never think twice about talking , about communicating .
`` in two weeks time , that 's the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed `` '' jeopardy '' '' set . ''
occasionally i still get recognized at the mall or whatever .
and when i do , it 's as a bit of a know-it-all .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name .
`` i remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me , as badly as i wanted to go to school , that i was also going to miss `` '' hollywood squares '' '' and `` '' family feud . '' '' i was going to miss my game shows . ''
and you think , ah hah , knowledge really is power — the right fact deployed at exactly the right place .
and of course i said yes , for several reasons .
so me and the other human player wound up at this secret ibm research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in westchester county to play the computer .
`` i think guys had `` '' w-a-t-s-o-n '' '' written on their bellies in grease paint . ''
being a renaissance man or woman , that 's something that was only possible in the renaissance .
that means between now and late 2014 , we will generate as much information , in terms of gigabytes , as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together .
they told the lifeguard , they went back to the hotel , and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach , luckily , because that was the day of the boxing day tsunami , the day after christmas , 2004 , that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean .
and it happens in real life all the time .
`` ( laughter ) the great 18th-century british theologian and thinker , friend of dr. johnson , samuel parr once said , `` '' it 's always better to know a thing than not to know it . '' '' and if i have lived my life by any kind of creed , it 's probably that . ''
i have always believed that the things we know — that knowledge is an absolute good , that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are , as individuals and as a species .
thank you very much .
but rather , it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog .
and so , that 's what i 've begin doing , and so i 'd like to unveil the international canopy network here .
and so we 're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy , the beauty of the canopy , the necessity of intact canopies , to people outside of academia .
and then the students would come into our sound studios , they would make their own rap songs with their own beats .
these mosses are taken from the forest ; they 're used by the floriculture industry , by florists , to make arrangements and make hanging baskets .
what can i , as an ecologist , do about that ?
i started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science .
by making these partnerships that i described to you , i have really opened my mind and , i have to say , my heart to have a greater understanding , to make other discoveries about nature and myself .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane .
the u.s. government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes .
aids had become a chronic disease .
they also stop passing on the virus .
this is fairly recent science that has shown that .
this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization .
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product , unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available , you will probably choose to do something else .
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
today , nelson otwoma is healthy .
`` nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool , and he told me not so long ago , `` '' ellen , we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us , that new medicines , without delay , become available to us . '' '' and this is no longer fantasy . ''
you 've started one or two in your time .
and if i see — you know , if i fly on somebody else 's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it was n't , 21 years ago , then i 'd think , well , you know , maybe i can create the kind of airline that i 'd like to fly on .
rb : yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
what does the brand stand for in your head ?
ca : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
i mean , what are the numbers on this ?
ca : so , you 've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that .
rb : yeah . we were launching a megastore in los angeles , i think .
ca : i mean , it is a tough job .
`` rb : yeah , well , 25 years earlier , we 'd launched the sex pistols ' `` '' god save the queen , '' '' and i 'd certainly never expected that 25 years later — that she 'd actually knight us . ''
ca : ok. so can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
i mean , i think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we 've done in the past .
and then finally , just thought , there 's a better way .
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and — ca : what did you write to your family ?
how much was the pr value part of this ?
rb : in fact , i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying , you know , come on , richard , there are better ways of crossing the atlantic .
and it was one of the reasons i left school when i was 15 years old .
rb : no , i think if you 're bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm .
( laughter ) rb : well , i 've done both . i think i went to prison first .
and one of the problems young people have is venereal disease .
`` and he said , `` '' look , bollocks is not a — has nothing to do with balls whatsoever . ''
you 've been accused of being ruthless .
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
and we just — you know , there were n't really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to — all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to extract the methane out of the earth 's atmosphere as well .
rb : i 'm 56 .
you know , if i can make a difference , i hope to be able to make a difference .
and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you 've got sergey and larry from google , for instance , who are good friends .
and you know they 're going to make a hell of a difference to the world .
and i was thinking that your body hated it , at the time , because we are very immune to this . this is called alpha-gal epitope .
our antibiotics are running out .
so probably it does n't matter 50 years from now — streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant — because we wo n't be here . but if we are — ( laughter ) we 're going to need something to do with the bacteria .
but basically what i was talking about there we 've now gotten to work .
and i 'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it .
and that is , why do we and other animals have brains ?
and at some point of its life , it implants on a rock .
that problem is solved .
one reason is a very smart five year-old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem — look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win .
so it 's a very simple algorithm .
so this is the end of a ph.d. project from one of the best robotics institutes .
it 's a hard problem because the water sloshes about , but it can do it .
but it does n't do it with anything like the agility of a human .
now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance .
and this is her getting the world record in real time .
`` so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard `` '' crrcckkk '' '' on the station you wanted to hear , that was the noise . ''
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
and more than that , the outside world , or task , is both ambiguous and variable .
it changes over time .
now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
now i would n't tell you all this if it was n't that a few years ago , we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills .
as we go around , we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down , but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is , and then combine those in a real bayesian way .
and what this part really says is i have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs .
so i get two sources .
what evidence is there for this ?
the left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle .
all we 're playing with is a tempo causality .
now i have to admit , these are the worst studies my lab has ever run .
so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .
but critically , they 're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms .
so they do n't know the rules the other person 's playing by .
and there 's a big gap between the task and the movement system .
so i hope i 've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement .
so i think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you 're laying down memories of childhood .
and these are the neighborhoods , for example , in the central valley of california that were n't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up ; they were decimated .
so we know what it 's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars .
and while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways , they actually invested in bicycling and in walking .
these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live , and their vehicle-miles traveled per day , the amount that each person drives , actually peaked in 1996 , has been dropping ever since , and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country .
the economist joe cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region .
these are all exaggerations , slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth , which is portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of america .
fourteen americans die each day from asthma , three times what it was in the '90s , and it 's almost all coming from car exhaust .
and we take car crashes for granted .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
because if your city is designed around cars , it 's really good at smashing them into each other .
the environmental movement in america has historically been an anti-city movement from jefferson on .
until some economists said , you know , is that the right way to measure co2 ?
there are only so many people in this country at any given time , and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact .
yet all of these innovations — that 's what they said in the brochure .
and then it 's usually won by cities where they speak german , like dusseldorf or vienna , where they 're burning , again , half as much fuel .
i do that hourly .
but i had always felt like , look , you know , i made the best choice i could make given who i was then , given the information i had on hand .
it somehow got me to where i am in life right now .
in other words , i had drunk our great cultural kool-aid about regret , which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time , that we should always look forward and not backward , and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets .
until i tell you who said it .
so if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you .
so let 's start off by defining some terms .
so in other words , we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance .
when i went home that night after getting my tattoo , i basically stayed up all night .
and we certainly do n't have any empathy for that part — which explains the third consistent component of regret , which is an intense desire to punish ourselves .
but i want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one .
and i think of this as a kind of existential wake-up call .
this is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
( laughter ) text : relpy to all .
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people 's health and happiness and livelihoods , and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
and the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality .
all right .
actually , you know what , i should warn you , you 're going to be disappointed .
so let me reassure you about something .
i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling .
the lesson that i ultimately learned from my tattoo and that i want to leave you with today is this : we need to learn to love the flawed , imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them .
i 'm a writer and a journalist , and i 'm also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , i 've learned how to do a lot of new things .
so i packed my cat , my rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
the cat came and went through an open window in the van .
the doggy went into doggy day care .
whenever i could , i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops .
ice in my ice chest melted within hours , and it was pretty miserable .
and i refused to give them up , so i stayed in the van .
and when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , i used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .
and i do n't know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
i just was n't drunk or high .
`` the real homeless do n't have hope . '' '' a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . and i remember thinking , `` if i killed myself , no one would notice . '' ''
but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
but i am here to tell you that , based on my experience , people are not where they live , where they sleep , or what their life situation is at any given time .
i believe in law and order .
i believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities .
and then a judge , a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input .
as each person , one by one , approached the front of that courtroom , i could n't stop but think : how did they get here ?
prosecuted , adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them .
we know there 's another seven million people on probation or parole , we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color , particularly poor people of color .
but what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them .
we rarely , if ever , talk about the prosecutor .
he was 18 years old , he was african american and he was a senior at a local public school .
this led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges .
with a criminal record and without a job , christopher would be unable to find employment , education or stable housing .
and i recognized him , but i could n't place from where , and before i knew it , this young man was hugging me .
it was christopher .
he wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community .
he applied to college , he obtained financial aid , and he went on to graduate from a four-year school .
it 's a bigger win for all of us .
in retrospect , the decision not to throw the book at christopher makes perfect sense .
thank you .
we were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche .
we saw some very ugly things .
you want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you .
keeps you safe .
in fact , there 's no statistical connection between combat and suicide .
in fact , one study found that if you deploy to iraq or afghanistan , you 're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later .
i did my fieldwork on the navajo reservation .
certainly , modern society is hard on the human psyche by every metric that we have .
around 50 percent have filed for ptsd compensation .
we know that if you take a lab rat and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself , you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely .
and veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way — in fact , any platoon that treated itself that way — would never survive .
veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes .
if we can , i think the vets are going to be fine .
thank you very much .
i was going through a lot of personal problems at the time .
my friend chris , who i just showed you a picture of , had been battling mental illness for some time .
it started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
and i went onstage to accept a webby award for best blog .
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a closing thought .
i 'd love to just talk about each one briefly .
it 's sad , and it 's not pleasant to talk about , but your husband might leave you , your girlfriend could cheat , your headaches might be more serious than you thought , or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .
one , you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever , or two , you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes .
`` the second `` '' a '' '' is awareness . ''
i love the way that they 'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for thanksgiving dinner .
i love the way that they see the world , because they 're seeing the world for the first time .
because you all used to be three years old .
that three-year-old boy is still part of you .
they 're in there .
you go places you 've dreamt about .
so those are the three a 's .
( applause ) when i was growing up , my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in canada .
we 've got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
you can watch a horror movie with monsters .
you can go to the movies and get good seats .
we 've got all that , but we 've only got 100 years to enjoy it .
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .
li-fi uses off-the-shelf leds to transmit data incredibly fast , and also in a safe and secure manner .
a solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy .
and this is faster than most broadband connections these days .
if i remove the blockage , the video will restart .
so we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well .
this means , despite the blockage , there 's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell , so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information , in this case , a high-definition video .
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals , and tell you about a tool , a very simple tool that i have found .
although it 's really nothing more than a literary conceit ; it 's not a technology .
and there was a day about seven years ago : i was planting potatoes , it was the first week of may — this is new england , when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom ; they 're just white clouds above .
and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience .
i had thought always — and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening — that lawns were nature under culture 's boot , that they were totalitarian landscapes , and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex .
as an intellectual matter , looking at the world from other species ' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly , which is — and this is in the realm of intellectual history — which is that we have this darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
ugh . mini-me . ( laughter ) we have this intellectual , this darwinian revolution in which , thanks to darwin , we figured out we are just one species among many ; evolution is working on us the same way it 's working on all the others ; we are acted upon as well as acting ; we are really in the fiber , the fabric of life .
you suddenly realize that consciousness — which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature , human consciousness — is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world .
all the six different species — rabbits , actually — are all performing ecological services for one another , such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another .
he waits three days , and then we towed in something called the eggmobile .
and what they 're doing is very interesting : they 're digging through the cow patties for the maggots , the grubs , the larvae of flies .
but look at it from the point of view of the grass , now .
what happens to the grass when you do this ?
so when they lose a lot of leaf mass , they shed roots ; they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .
they were looking the next karmapa , and i noticed they were talking to my mom and dad , and the news came to me that they were telling me that i was the karmapa .
how did that feel when they came and whisked you away , and your lifestyle completely changed ?
and what i mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
i was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment .
and immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
and i think that 's symbolic of what we 're seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
that 's wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
td : so we ended up talking about the bamiyan buddhas , which , as you know , were destroyed some years ago in afghanistan .
of course , in muslim , because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry , you do n't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the buddhist tradition , where , of course , there are many statues of the buddha that are highly revered .
so , we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas , but i offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way .
what we saw in the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas was the depletion of matter , some solid substance falling down and disintegrating .
so i think the way forward for the world — one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness — is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
( gasps ) oops . sorry .
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga .
well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
the flash is like a scream for help .
it 's got a lot of other light organs you ca n't see , but you 'll see in here in a minute .
it 's unbelievable .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
they 're things like this .
this is a golden coral , a bush .
so if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that 's just breathtaking .
it 's a green saber of light .
and when it starts flashing , it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast .
but as soon as it starts to flash — and it 's going to look big , because it blooms on the camera — i want you to look right here .
but he 's persistent .
( laughter ) nope .
but if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights .
bioenergy is n't global warming . bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . bioenergy is oil . it 's gas . it 's coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it , as opposed to where the rivers flood . you start getting this organic agriculture ; you start putting machinery onto this stuff . machinery , with a whole bunch of water , leads to very large-scale agriculture .
one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we do n't understand . we do n't even know what oil is . we do n't know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assumption , and one of the best guesses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
and as you 're looking at this system , if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight , then bioenergy works in a different way . and we 've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels .
`` he was at hopkins when he did this , and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , `` '' i did n't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins . do you know he just won the nobel ? '' '' ( laughter ) i mean , that was mom , but anyway , this guy is just a class act . you find him at the bench every single day , working on a pipette and building stuff . and one of the things this guy just built are these things . ''
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , insert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that 's one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons . that means 86 percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff . and there 's a role in here for conservation . there 's a role in here for alternative stuff , but we 've also got to get that other portion right .
the first time i heard about this christian coptic community was in 2009 when the egyptian authorities under the regime of hosni mubarak decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of h1n1 virus .
i was looking for the st. simon monastery on the top of the muqattam mountain .
but to reach there , you must dodge between the trucks overpacked with garbage and slalom between the tuk-tuks , the fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood .
the zaraeeb , that’s how they call themselves , which means the pig breeders , have been collecting the garbage of cairo and sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades .
they have developed one of the most efficient and highly profitable systems on a global level .
this is where they built the st. simon monastery , a 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself .
and then magd came .
magd is a guide from the church .
he managed to get me a meeting with father samaan , and surprisingly , he loved the idea .
`` so for manshiyat naser , i decided to write in arabic the words of st. athanasius of alexandria , a coptic bishop from the third century , who said : ( arabic ) , which means in english , `` '' anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first . '' '' it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words . ''
so father samaan blessed the project , and his approval brought all the residents on board .
so day after day , the calligraphy circle was taking shape , and we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece .
and standing exactly at this point every day made my realize the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece .
for the first few days , they were always refusing anything we were offering them , even a snack or a drink .
we need to question our level of misconception and judgment we can have as a society upon communities based on their differences .
everybody used to gather there .
`` in egypt , they have another expression , which is `` '' nawartouna , '' '' which means , `` '' you brought light to us . '' '' in manshiyat naser they were always telling us this . ''
but firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we 're designing and get them in motion , showing how they 'll be used .
i have a few of them — they 're no more than a minute or a minute-and-a-half apiece — but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it responds in video .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you 're interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
`` the last time i went to see this store , there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering , `` am i going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here ? '' ''
and then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror , where you put on the clothes .
i do n't know if anybody 's seen this — it 's pretty spectacular in the room .
then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor — mostly teenagers coming out of there — there 's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by durrell [ bishop ] and andrew [ hirniak ] of itch .
narrator : though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under san francisco 's oakland bay bridge , the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems .
in the second group 's scenario , the walls are alive and actually give dilbert a group hug .
you can see : there 's the plant .
and we 're announcing a new product here tonight , which is the first time this has ever been shown in public .
you throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet .
the fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater . ) ( applause ) dk : and the last thing i 'll talk about is approtec , which is a project that i 'm very excited about .
so we 're in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
so with seed-squeezers , and pumps , and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we 're designing — my students are doing this as class projects and ideo has donated their time to do this kind of work — it 's really amazing to see his success , martin 's .
to be a man means not to be a girl .
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .
i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital , with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person i 've ever met .
his name is dr. denis mukwege .
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened .
because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
i actually realized once in kosovo , when i watched a man break down , that bullets are actually hardened tears , that when we do n't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability , and have their compassion , and have their hearts , that they become hardened and hurtful and violent .
and i will tell you a very funny story .
and all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chick flicks .
`` and they were all alone , and i thought , `` '' this is the secret life of men . '' '' ( laughter ) i 've traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i 've seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it 's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world . ''
i 've seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves .
i know a 14-year-old girl in the netherlands , for example , who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
`` i want to talk about rachel corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an israeli tank to say , `` '' end the occupation . '' '' and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank . ''
and she was holding her baby .
she knew that meant she would n't go to school .
but i promise you , now that i will be educated i will always take care of you , and i will come back and i will build you a house .
and that is the power of transformation .
`` i was asking girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , `` '' no , i hate it . i ca n't stand it . ''
i am an emotional creature .
they make me present . they make me ready . they make me strong .
it 's like the older women somehow forgot .
nothing 's been diluted .
nothing 's leaked out .
thank you very much .
ham and i took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome , but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand .
there were several steps to this . there were two sides : we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules , and we had to solve the biological side of how , if we had this new chemical entity , how would we boot it up , activate it in a recipient cell .
so in addition to doing the transplant , we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell .
we got a text from dan saying that , now , the first blue colonies existed .
so we wo n't give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
i 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is .
we have , at the institute , ongoing funding now from nih in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year .
because instead of taking weeks to months to make these , dan 's team can now make these in less than 24 hours .
those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we 're taking .
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play flappy bird again . ( laughter )
with the money made from the viral video , we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own game in a box .
and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored .
so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students .
now , there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force .
so take a look at this tutorial .
this means that we can make this project relevant to anyone .
the war in syria has been happening for five years .
turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand or something of the sort , if you count all refugees .
and europe has not been able to do so , because basically , europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the european project .
and let 's be honest , this is the moment in which we need more europe instead of less europe .
so , what 's your position ?
how do you imagine these people reacting ?
so i would say that even today , the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open .
that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues .
`` and it 's just telling them , `` '' you are right , we are against you . '' '' so obviously , this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic , multi-religious , multicultural , this is creating a situation in which , really , it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed . ''
bg : in what sense ?
i think , as i said , essentially terrorism in europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing , and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong , by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world .
and europe , to a large extent , failed in that investment in the past few decades .
in 2005 , we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world .
`` another thing that 's really unique about `` '' the wizard of oz '' '' to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female . ''
he was only three at the time .
`` compare this to 1939 with `` '' the wizard of oz . '' '' how does dorothy win her movie ? ''
`` do you remember what the critics said when `` '' brave '' '' came out ? ''
it has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
alison bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid-'80s , she recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw .
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? ( laughter ) right ? thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much .
it pretty much flunks the bechdel test .
`` we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst-ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , `` '' are you coming to bed , honey ? '' '' that 's hollywood for you . ''
2011 , of the 100 most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists ?
what are they failing to learn ?
`` we have tools at our disposal like `` '' girl power , '' '' and we hope that that will help , but i got ta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passively , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ? ''
i mean , i think the netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here .
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood .
obi-wan .
i think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
i like that kind of quest for my daughter , and i like that kind of quest for my son .
titus should have thought of this as a horrible year , a year of accusation and trial , but over .
titus was so bitter .
he lost his entire savings , and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering .
`` and if i meet somebody on an airplane — this happened on the way over to scotland — if i meet somebody on an airplane , and we ask each other , `` '' what do you do ? what do you do ? '' '' and i say `` '' i study memory , '' '' they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names , or they 've got a relative who 's got alzheimer 's or some kind of memory problem , but i have to tell them i do n't study when people forget . ''
they 're reconstructive .
extreme memories for horrific brutalizations , sometimes in satanic rituals , sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements .
and what i found is that most of these situations involved some particular form of psychotherapy .
and so i asked , were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy — like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation , or in some cases hypnosis , or in some cases exposure to false information — were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre , unlikely memories ?
and we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects .
our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods : hard-boiled eggs , dill pickles , strawberry ice cream .
if we planted a warm , fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus , we could get people to want to eat asparagus more .
i know what i would choose for a kid of mine .
i emitted , in the atmosphere , nine tons of co2 ; that is the weight of two elephants .
i came here to speak about ecology , and i emitted as much co2 as a frenchman in one year .
you know the problem ; we do n't want to believe what we know .
and you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature , and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea .
one fifth of human kind depend on fish to live .
according to fao , if we do n't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050 .
the beautiful picture , by [ unclear ] in africa .
i sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question , the same crucial question , about life .
woman : you 're asking me a hard question .
fourth man : i live happily because what else should i do ?
if someday i can achieve something , i would like to say thank you daddy and mommy .
13th man : after seven years now of being in a wheelchair , i 've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair .
( applause ) yab : you can also go to the website , answer — respond to the questions also .
now i am going to speak to you about my movie .
for generations , we 've been raising our children , not unlike millions of other species living beside us .
so what are we waiting for ?
but it is not a normal movie .
this film has no copyright .
( applause )
my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact i inserted into conversation .
thank you for that reaction .
and there 's the sheep .
and it was successful overall .
so now i 'm back to adopting many — not all ; i do n't wear a helmet anymore — but dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during my year .
it was really a life-changing project .
and i , of course , do n't have time to go into all of them .
let me just tell you two really quickly .
the first is — and this was surprising to me ; i did n't expect this to come out — but i live a much quieter life now .
and it was done in europe .
so without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
and the second point i want to make , the final point , is that — and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed — that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
( laughter ) and it has made me a healthier person .
`` ( laughter ) it 's true — my mom and especially my dad always said : `` respect your opponent , and never underestimate them , ever . '' ''
so we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play , have a place to compete and make a living .
so there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract .
we do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us , there is no question .
i really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to title ix .
`` i said , `` '' more importantly , did you get it ? '' '' ( laughter ) and they did ! ''
they got to play team sports in a way they had n't before .
so you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete , a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the women 's sports foundation .
bjk : i think it goes back to an epiphany i had at 12 .
it 's simply amazing what 's possible because of it .
and we catch ourselves — i mean , i catch myself to this day .
that 's really the reason i 'm able to do this .
and then deloitte .
so the millennials are fantastic ; they want connection , engagement .
are they going to make a difference ?
they have big ideas and they can make big things happen .
but what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials .
`` because i do think they care about the environment and all these things . '' '' and they go , `` '' oh , billie , they can not focus . '' '' ( laughter ) they actually have proven that the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds . ( laughter ) ''
and they do n't really care .
and i want to hear from people .
ok ? you do n't have to agree with somebody , but everyone has the opportunity .
and every one of you is an influencer .
pm : billie , you have been an inspiration for us .
this is a plot of frequency against time — sort of like musical notation , where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower , and time goes this way .
it 's really important for our music and our language .
they can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals .
`` as you can see at the top here , they share an up-sweep , like `` '' woop , woop , woop . '' '' they both have that kind of up-sweep . ''
it 's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they 've had .
and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia , lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats .
of the ones that stayed , their reproductive rate declined .
we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .
the world is mostly blue .
that same sound traveled to the west , and could be heard in bermuda , and traveled to the east , and could be heard in monterey — the same sound .
unlike fins and blues , which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans , the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds , so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency , broader-band and more complicated .
in '95 they all sang the normal song .
nobody sang the old ones .
that 's shown down here .
here 's the same call recorded from a hydrophone 500 miles away .
now this is something that 's been known for quite a while .
over the last 50 years , as we 've put more noise into the oceans , these whales have had to shift .
so at this point , it 's primarily an issue of cost and standards .
this is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision .
these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay of fundy .
`` well , biologists who could n't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say , `` '' ca n't you move that lane ? those are just lines on the ground . ''
the shipping lanes have been moved .
and as you can see , the risk of collision is much lower .
so to conclude , i 'd just like to point out , you know , the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment .
thank you very much .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o . box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak — a single mother in sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural kansas , all asking me , a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
but then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
and , you know , it 's a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
was a beloved pianist , maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century .
`` and the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said , `` '' no , no , wait a minute . ''
and in the right speaker is going to be the original recording , and the left speaker is going to be the new recording , actually of an instrument just like that one , and i 'm going to play them together at the same time .
and i got to tell you , if you have n't heard high-definition surround , go down to your audio dealer , your audiophile dealer .
but if you do n't have that , maybe you can listen on your headphones .
except now you 're inside glenn gould 's body playing the piano , and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process .
and i believe this is coming .
`` we 've seen all these `` '' star treks , '' '' and they 're all holodeck episodes as well . ''
and i want you to hear that right now .
now , atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons .
( laughter ) do n't tell anyone . it 's a secret .
now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight .
( dolphin noises ) so you 're going to see two groups , and you 're going to see the head-to-head posturing , some open mouths , lots of squawking .
( dolphin noises ) you see , they 're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad .
but a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology , an interface to do two-way communication , and that 's what we 've been trying to do in the bahamas and in real time .
now , dolphins are social mammals , so they love to play , and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed , or sargassum in this case , around .
now in this footage , the adult is caroh .
but when we do n't dive down and get it , they 'll bring it to the surface and they 'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves , and then we 'll pick it up and have a game .
and these are artificially created whistles .
let 's see if they might actually understand what that means .
so diver a plays the scarf whistle or diver b plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it .
i once had this nightmare : i 'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines .
mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict .
i saw the young boy who had to endure physical and emotional trauma .
`` i naively asked myself , `` '' but seriously , who made those weapons ? ''
they end up relying on humanitarian agencies , which is insufficient and unsustainable , especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured .
in one of mohammed 's early medical reports , he was diagnosed with signs of ptsd .
some 11,000 people have been killed or injured since 1973 .
this lethal weapon has been used by over 20 states during armed conflicts in over 35 countries , such as ukraine , iraq and sudan .
but some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions — namely , the united states , russia and china — remain outside of this lifesaving treaty and continue to produce them , reserve the right to produce them in the future , keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles and even possibly use them in the future .
cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in yemen and syria .
research shows that cluster munitions often contaminate areas where agriculture is the main source of income .
culturally , he 's expected to provide for his family , but he simply ca n't .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm not here to beg for money , i just want to earn it . '' '' mohammed today is 21 years old . ''
on january 26 , 2013 , a band of al-qaeda militants entered the ancient city of timbuktu on the southern edge of the sahara desert .
but africa , and the far-flung corners of the world , are not the only places , or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy .
`` at the time , i was working on `` '' the chess of love , '' '' the last important long poem of the european middle ages never to have been edited . ''
there are about five of these in the world .
our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years .
having a lab that can travel to collections where it 's needed , however , is only part of the solution .
over the past five years , our team of imaging scientists , scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world 's most valuable damaged manuscripts , included the vercelli book , which is the oldest book of english , the black book of carmarthen , the oldest book of welsh , and some of the most valuable earliest gospels located in what is now the former soviet georgia .
`` the word overwritten was `` '' citizens . '' '' perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was . ''
`` `` subjects . '' ''
this was the map that columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the new world and which gave him his idea of what asia looked like and where japan was located .
in asia , we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature 's entire body .
what about the future ?
i 've got two kids ; he 's 21 now , my daughter 's 16 .
but that does n't solve my change room dilemmas , does it ?
i 'm a trans person .
do n't even get me started on how they treat us in airports .
if we do n't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone , then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places .
she had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her .
she 'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem , and that problem started with her and was hers alone .
so i asked her to tell me the story of what had happened , asked her to tell me how it made her feel .
she asked me .
what about people with anxiety issues ?
our democracies rely on elections .
without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
you see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry — a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
and the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
and the secret is the ballot form .
and that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , i wo n't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
so we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us , and then we 'll use the paper for verification .
so this is how you vote .
chris anderson : the rights of citizens , the future of the internet .
( applause ) ed is in a remote location somewhere in russia controlling this bot from his laptop , so he can see what the bot can see .
you 've been called a whistleblower , a traitor , a hero .
ca : so let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed .
prism is about content .
but there 's an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let 's do this through a warrant process , let 's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users ' data , we saw stories in the washington post last year that were n't as well reported as the prism story that said the nsa broke in to the data center communications between google to itself and yahoo to itself .
but let 's assume that these people really believe this .
going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat does n't make us safe , and that applies whether it 's in iraq or on the internet .
american businesses , chinese businesses , and any other company out there is a part of our society .
it 's a part of our interconnected world .
there are ties of fraternity that bond us together , and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards , the security , the manner of behavior , that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by .
es : there are absolutely more revelations to come .
they 're programs through which the nsa intentionally misleads corporate partners .
they tell corporate partners that these are safe standards .
so by reducing the security of our communications , they 're not only putting the world at risk , they 're putting america at risk in a fundamental way , because intellectual property is the basis , the foundation of our economy , and if we put that at risk through weak security , we 're going to be paying for it for years .
congress , who has access to be briefed on these things , and now has the desire to be , has produced bills to reform it , and two independent white house panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the united states .
the fbi went to congress and did make the case .
but congress and the american people said no .
we should n't be threatening dissidents .
es : i can see you . ( laughter ) ca : and who goes with the second choice , the fundamentally heroic act ?
this is not a left or right issue .
tim , actually , would you like to come up and say , do we have a microphone for tim ?
es : nice to meet you , and i hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does .
ca : thank you , tim .
but at the same time , the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal , that they want me to compromise the journalists with which i 've been working , to come back , and i want to make it very clear that i did not do this to be safe .
( applause ) ca : in the meantime , courtesy of the internet and this technology , you 're here , back in north america , not quite the u.s. , canada , in this form .
es : canada is different than what i expected .
`` ( laughter ) ca : at ted , the mission is `` '' ideas worth spreading . '' '' if you could encapsulate it in a single idea , what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment ? ''
but we 're not seeing all the waves out there .
instead , our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world .
it 's called the umwelt , which is the german word for the surrounding world .
let 's do a consciousness-raiser on this .
everything is about smell for you .
( laughter ) what is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air ?
but the question is , do we have to be stuck there ?
now , how do we understand that ?
it 's essentially a general purpose computing device , and it just takes in everything and figures out what it 's going to do with it , and that , i think , frees up mother nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels .
so snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared , and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors , and the star-nosed mole has this appendage with 22 fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a 3d model of the world , and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet .
so what this means is that nature does n't have to continually redesign the brain .
so as i 'm speaking , my sound is getting captured by the tablet , and then it 's getting mapped onto a vest that 's covered in vibratory motors , just like the motors in your cell phone . so as i 'm speaking ,
he was born profoundly deaf , which means that there 's a part of his umwelt that 's unavailable to him .
for example , could we feed real-time data from the internet directly into somebody 's brain , and can they develop a direct perceptual experience ?
then , two buttons appear , and he has to make a choice .
( laughter ) and the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes .
and that 's just the beginning .
thank you .
de : well , that 's right , i would n't have to write to nih anymore .
we have to crawl that with our attentional systems .
and most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent african-american population in the city at that time .
so obviously , we have a q & a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
so that question is really powerful , and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment , when you connect it to the stories that some detroiters had , and actually a lot of african-americans ' families have had that are living in midwestern cities like detroit .
the first couple of decades of their life in the north is quite well , up until about 1950 , which coincides with the city 's peak population at 1.8 million people .
but this time , the migration leaves african-americans in place , as families and businesses flee the city , leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs .
citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities , and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots , and they 're starting community gardens , which are creating a great sense of community stewardship , but they 're very , very clear to tell us that this is not enough , that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them .
these folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new , entrepreneurial ideas and profit , so much so that former models can move to detroit , buy property , start successful businesses and restaurants , and become successful community activists in their neighborhood , bringing about very positive change .
so the descendants of the great migration could either become precision watchmakers at shinola , like willie h. , who was featured in one of their ads last year , or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like shinola .
thank you .
and yet rather than be scared , most of you will feel that what i 'm talking about is kind of cool .
`` and if i were to convince you in this talk that we were likely to suffer a global famine , either because of climate change or some other catastrophe , and that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are very likely to live like this , you would n't think , `` '' interesting . ''
a full-scale nuclear war ?
a global pandemic ?
i mean , there 's just atoms in here , and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior , we will eventually , unless we are interrupted , we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines .
the second assumption is that we will keep going .
if only half the stories about him are half true , there 's no question he 's one of the smartest people who has ever lived .
well , we 'd be free to play frisbee and give each other massages .
they 'll be grafted onto our brains , and we 'll essentially become their limbic systems .
( laughter ) the deeper problem is that building superintelligent ai on its own seems likely to be easier than building superintelligent ai and having the completed neuroscience that allows us to seamlessly integrate our minds with it .
and given that the companies and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves as being in a race against all others , given that to win this race is to win the world , provided you do n't destroy it in the next moment , then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do will get done first .
these planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course .
if we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of mars for human habitation , then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the earth .
thank you .
( applause )
and there 's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle .
it takes a little while to get our heads around , but i 'll try to explain it in simple terms .
now that safe germ , that antigen , tricks our body into mounting an immune response , learning and remembering how to deal with intruders .
and we see this kind of data .
it would be 10 times bigger than the size of that screen , going 10 times deeper as well .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
however , you still do n't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait .
on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated , and that dashed line indicates the protection threshold .
if we 're above that line it 's considered protective ; if we 're below that line it 's not .
that 's what 's achieved with the nanopatch ; the delivered dose of the nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve .
( applause )
and what he heard was heartbreaking .
when our relatives die , we ca n't take care of them as our tradition demands .
ebola means you ca n't hold your children the way you would in this situation .
you ca n't bury your dead the way that you would .
( applause ) now , this does n't mean that the job is done , obviously .
but what it does teach us is that ebola can be beaten .
so people did n't even recognize the disease , people who knew ebola .
for that reason it evaded detection for some time , but contrary to public belief sometimes these days , once the virus was detected , there was a rapid surge in of support .
and as you can anticipate , there was international alarm , international concern on a scale that we had n't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this .
this caused not only problems , obviously , for the countries themselves , but also for the response .
they started to recoil from those people that you saw in those space suits , as they call them , who had come to help them .
we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it .
but despite the fact that we 've not known this disease for a particularly long time , and we do n't know everything about it , we do know how to stop this disease .
and then we 've got to be able to have systems that can find every single case , every contact of those cases , and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission .
it was stopped in senegal , where it had spread , and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus , in this outbreak .
there was so much disease , they approached it differently .
remember , this virus , this whole crisis , rather , started with one case , and is going to finish with one case .
but it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists , enough health workers , enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases , track their contacts and make sure that this disease stops once and for all .
now , by promoting economic development , i do n't mean anything magical .
so for example , states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants .
so as a result , my employer is going to be less productive .
even if everyone at my firm has good skills , if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills , my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets .
so as a result , if we can invest in other people 's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality , we not only help those children , we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we 'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth .
so the reality is , if you invest in kids , they will stay .
okay , so to sum up , there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs , if run in a high-quality way , pay off in higher adult skills .
so if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four , full-day preschool at age four , the total annual national cost would be roughly 30 billion dollars .
now , that 's one barrier .
so i think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong .
and this speed , combined with today 's high-performance micro-controllers , allows us to actually simulate , in this piece , over 17,000 leds — using just 64 .
i was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day , and i had access to 3d printers .
it just printed the pieces overnight .
( applause ) so it was n't the first time that i printed clothes .
later that year , a friend gave me a 3d printed necklace , printed using a home printer .
the breakthrough came when i was introduced to filaflex , which is a new kind of filament .
( laughter ) so the printer plates are small , so i had to piece the garment together , just like a puzzle .
audience : yeah !
thank you so much .
my first date was colin .
alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him .
in order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together , stacey and i went to sun city summerlin , which is the largest retirement community in las vegas .
dean had been named photographer of the year in las vegas two years in a row , and this caught alec 's attention , as did the fact that he met his wife , judy , at the same age when alec met rachel .
nevertheless , they were married soon after .
i 'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list , but these seven , i think , are pretty large habits that we can all fall into .
it demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
i do n't mean romantic love , but i do mean wishing people well , for two reasons .
this instrument is incredible , and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened .
that 's register .
or , i can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet .
but now , the maker community and the open-source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of back into our lives , and i believe we need to take them to the next level , to the components things are made of .
so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires .
conductive ink has been used by artists , but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens .
so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials .
we may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch .
smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities .
there 's barely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced .
jordan bunker , who had had no experience with chemistry until then , read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances and tools .
he used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker .
and now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements .
back then , computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home .
we saw that books were being turned into e-books , blackboards were being turned into youtube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into moocs — massive online open courses .
and if you think about it , all we 're really doing here is taking the same content and the same format , and bringing it out to more students — which is great , do n't get me wrong , that is really great — but the teaching method is still more or less the same , no real innovation there .
and what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods .
it literally feels like i just stepped inside this virtual lab .
audience : yes .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle .
superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens , or krypton , but he 's sent in a pod , much like moses was on the nile .
and it 's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked .
this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the 99 .
those are basic human values .
those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of 33 stones each through arabia into andalusia in spain , where they 're safe for 200 years .
now it 's very easy to assume that those books , because they were from a library called bait al-hikma , were muslim books , but that 's not the case because the caliph that built that library , his name was al-ma'mun — he was harun al-rashid 's son .
`` they said , `` '' your highness , the scholars are cheating . ''
there 's a king arthur element to the storyline , okay .
everybody believes the koran is for all time and all place .
then there 's a group that believes the koran is a living , breathing document , and i captured that idea within these stones that self-update .
and he controls them from the top down — whereas when they work for the other side , eventually , when they find out this is the wrong person , they 've been manipulated , they actually , each one has a different , colorful kind of dress .
why three ? a couple of reasons .
i think that 's there in all cultures , right ?
and so this is the way i dealt with it .
so here 's some of the characters that we have .
so the 99 attributes of allah have the yin and the yang ; there 's the powerful , the hegemonous , the strong , and there 's also the kind , the generous .
i 'm like , are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong ?
al-batina is the hidden .
`` and she said , `` '' show me . '' '' so i showed this . ''
next to him is dan panosian , one of the character creators for the modern-day x-men .
`` he said , `` '' naif , islam and cartoon ? ''
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park — 300,000 square feet , 20 rides , all with our characters : a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey .
you are noora the light .
dana : no .
jabbar : then what about the rest of us ?
jabbar : aaaahhh !
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models .
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being manipulated .
and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it 's done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
now , one of the things that i refer to when i — about the importance of this message — is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university , where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior , and i gave the students two articles , one from the new york times and one from new york magazine .
the second one took place in upstate new york .
this is islam 's influence on hinduism and judaism .
( laughter ) but i borrow a lesson that i learned from him .
on that cover you see batman , superman and a fully-clothed wonder woman with our saudi member of the 99 , our emirati member and our libyan member .
thank you very much .
but — you know what i 'm saying ?
and then you 'll be even more convinced you ca n't succeed .
they are highly unpredictable .
`` `` sperm donor ? what 's the rush ? '' ''
bernard read his first paragraph , i read my first paragraph , bernard read his second paragraph , i read my second paragraph , in this way towards the end of our papers .
now , what does that mean ?
quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality .
we might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices , and that 's why we did n't succeed .
now , i started with a quote from samuel johnson , who said that when we make choice in life , we should n't forget to live .
( applause )
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author 's description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
and i did n't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , i 've spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
and i 've learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
and even though the film did n't make any money — barely broke even , i should say — i witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
they were seeing something magical .
not a movie , not hd — for real .
`` when i say , `` '' i 'm operating it , '' '' but my mind is in the vehicle . ''
it was really , really quite profound .
they do n't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
and this was fascinating .
i did n't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions .
`` why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? '' '' we do n't make money at these damn shows . ''
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
`` when you come back to the shore and you say , `` '' we had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , '' '' you ca n't explain it to people . it 's that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it . ''
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
`` i have young filmmakers come up to me and say , `` '' give me some advice for doing this . '' '' and i say , `` '' do n't put limitations on yourself . ''
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
and if you did , you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone .
i actually was offered , right out of medical school , and accepted a volunteer contract to work with unicef in war-torn somalia , that was worth one dollar .
`` journalists called it the `` '' city of death . '' '' and they called it the city of death because 300,000 people had lost their lives there — 300,000 people , mostly as a result of war-related famine and disease . ''
i was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe .
there were dozens of women who were standing in line , and they were clutching their infants very close .
after all , it is as old as existence itself .
we say never again , and yet it happens again and again and again .
to answer that question , let 's take a look at this map of the world .
well , you notice that , in fact , that also goes up roughly three- to fourfold .
because , you see , small arms anywhere are a menace everywhere , because their first stop is rarely their last .
increased control mechanisms wo n't solve that problem .
but it 's an important step in the right direction .
but here 's the thing : they take time , which means for you as individuals , if you want to give , please , by all means do it .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
but nothing else does either .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
we had an amazing childhood . we did n't have any money , but we were outdoors most of the time .
it was rather dull . but i came back to africa at the age of 17 , as a volunteer teacher to lesotho , which is a tiny country , surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa .
but the kids were the best part .
`` and so , i said — i was annoyed — i said , `` '' what are you doing ? ''
`` i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying . '' '' well — ( laughter ) — i had n't thought of that one . ''
we can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line .
`` what banged ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` everyone talks about the big bang . what banged ? '' ''
it 's all i can convey . according to these theories , there are extra dimensions of space , not just the three we 're familiar with , but at every point in the room there are more dimensions .
but it 's slightly different than in the conventional picture .
and we try to convince ourselves — we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong .
what about those kids i 'd left behind ?
then there 's hiv/aids . and then there are deaths from war .
it 's still going on .
well , here 's the number of physicians in africa .
here 's the number of people in higher education .
well , the transition to democracy in south africa in 1994 was literally a dream come true for many of us .
but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills , especially mathematical skills , in industry , in government , in education .
and if you do n't have math , you 're not going to enter the modern age .
the idea was to set up an african institute for mathematical sciences , or aims .
it 's an 80-room art deco hotel from the 1920s .
it 's a beautiful building . we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word : we 're going to start the best math institute in africa in this hotel .
well , the new south africa is a very exciting country .
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa 's development , because , in those areas , scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .
here is a list of last year 's graduates , graduated in june , and what they 're currently doing — 48 of them .
when a county is colored yellow , we 've received an application ; orange , we 've accepted an application ; and green , a student has graduated .
so there 's 2005 , -6 , -7 , -8 .
( applause ) we 're well on the way to achieving our initial goal .
after that , i came to the netherlands where i 'm now doing a ph.d. in theoretical immunology .
nt : another student in the first year of aims was shehu .
shehu : and from there we will be able to , hopefully , make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions .
and what we need to do is to replicate it .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
and we want to add elements to the curriculum .
so we have political support right across the continent .
at every site there will be huge challenges .
every group of female friends has the funny one , the one you go to when you need a good cry , the one who tells you to suck it up when you 've had a hard day .
and as everyone knows , if you want to understand what 's happening in a community and in a home , you talk to women , whether you 're talking about southern afghanistan , or southern california .
`` `` '' female soldiers : become a part of history . ''
and from alabama to alaska , a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best , and to make a difference for their country , answered that call to serve .
they also wore body armor .
`` they would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs , and board the helicopter for an operation , and they would come back and watch a movie called `` '' bridesmaids . '' '' ( laughter ) they even wore a thing called spanx , because , as they found very quickly , the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small , and small where they should be big . ''
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
and some of them do n't .
thank you so much .
what do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy ?
now how do we get to augmented reality ?
unfortunately , it 's not nfl practice footage because the nfl thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces , but — ( laughter ) — we do what we can .
blue 8 ! blue 8 ! go !
how do we take that next step ?
i think adult diaper sales may surge .
they ended up winning a super bowl that year .
more people watched the game because it was more exciting .
you take all that information , and you stream it to your players .
that determines good teams from bad .
he goes , catches the ball , sprints in , touchdown .
now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game .
fans want to be on the field .
they want to be their favorite player .
because i believe that we can use augmented reality for something more .
to a commander hadfield or a neil degrasse tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and kardashians ?
the questions we ask , the choices we make , and the challenges we face are , as always , up to us .
thank you .
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we can not see .
what i think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves .
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to neda , people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to tehran , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
take , therefore , what modern technology is capable of : the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally .
in the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism , anti-semitism , racism , apartheid , discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world .
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
this is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doctors ; it has 200 nurses ; it has 120 midwives .
you can not begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
she herself was suffering from hiv ; she was suffering from tuberculosis .
when you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv/aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
if you 're thinking this is ebola , actually , in this case , it 's not .
yet for the last year , it has been ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear .
in that case , if we want vaccines , we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy .
so these are the things that can be done , but to do this , if we want to deal with a complete market failure , we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases .
every year , we spend billions of dollars , keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen .
and vaccines are our best defense .
i 'm here today , as june said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years .
and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global warming , and they 'd like our coral reef to be part of it .
and she nearly had a fit because christine is a professor at one of l.a. 's major art colleges , calarts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
`` cast it in bronze . '' '' but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure . ''
and what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
and i have a point outside the line . how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
so it 's like the equator or the lines of longitude .
it 's a bit suspicious is n't it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
this is what it looks like .
this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they 're sitting there feeling bamboozled .
but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a flat surface .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
but look , i can prove to you that they 're straight because i can take any one of these lines , and i can fold along it .
now , i said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible .
here 's two creatures who 've never heard of euclid 's parallel postulate — did n't know it was impossible to violate , and they 're simply getting on with it .
but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it — the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one — when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
we have these technologies . we use them .
and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
the value of education is something that froebel championed , through plastic modes of play .
( applause )
so , in b.i. , life was simple .
people actually tried to predict the future , even the economists .
( applause ) thank you .
does n't this sound like a software thing ?
this thing can put 23,000 components per hour onto an electronics board .
this is a factory in a box .
it 's 30 percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method , and it 's much better for the environment .
this is kind of like when we went from transistor radios wrapped by hand to the pentium .
one of my favorite principles is the power of pull , which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them rather than stocking them in the center and controlling everything .
we do n't have enough money . let 's kickstarter it .
we could not have planned this whole thing , but by having a very strong compass , we eventually got to where we were going , and to me it 's very similar to agile software development , but this idea of compasses is very important .
`` so i do n't like the word `` '' futurist . '' '' i think we should be now-ists , like we are right now . ''
thank you .
so i begin with an advertisement inspired by george orwell that apple ran in 1984 .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .
and their decisions about software coding , engineering , design , terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives .
after all , even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year .
and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond .
so we assume that the internet is a border-busting technology .
but if you look at china , vietnam and a number of the former soviet states , what 's happening there is more troubling .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
we also are going to need political innovation .
so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision , and at the very roots of how we can see .
and i wanted the world to know what was happening up there .
so i decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly unfreezing .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
this morning , the temperature of the english channel was 18 degrees .
some people think that swimming is a very solo sport , you just dive into the sea and off you go .
`` i had to see my coach screaming for me , `` come on lewis ! come on ! go ! go ! go ! do n't slow down ! '' ''
i have never in my life felt anything like that moment .
i remember just trying to get out of the water .
and they had burst . and i was in so much agony .
there is no possibility that this was going to happen .
a number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the north pole .
i 've known you , and i know , lewis , deep down , right deep down here , that you are going to make this swim .
we stand at a very , very important moment in this history , and you 're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders .
and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
`` and i said to myself , `` '' lewis , do n't look left , do n't look right . ''
`` just scuttle forward and go for it . '' '' and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice . ''
thank you so much .
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
now is the time to believe .
there 's a lot of activity in india .
now you can also see , if i turn this around here — hopefully i wo n't shake the world too much .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
and even in antarctica — well , at least this time of year — we from time to time will see a query rising up .
and it 's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to . hopefully your experience is good .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
this is one of our engineers .
we find that they work better when they 're submerged and covered with leaves .
there are a variety of demographics . i wo n't bore you with these .
larry page : thank you , sergey .
so one of the things — both sergey and i went to a montessori school , and i think , for some reason , this has been incorporated in google .
mendel , who was supposed to be teaching high-school students , actually , you know , discovered the laws of genetics — as a hobby , basically .
and news , which i just mentioned , was started by a researcher .
and he just — he — after 9/11 , he got really interested in the news .
and we would n't really be sure if it 's going to work or not .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
but then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects .
and we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them — and these are kind of made up .
do n't really pay attention to them .
all right , see ? you guys should try it out .
and it 's sort of like a better version of the toolbar .
thank you , sergey .
we also allow dogs and things like that , and we 've had , i think , a really fun culture at our company , which helps people work and enjoy what they 're doing .
`` this is actually our `` '' cult picture . '' '' i just wanted to show quickly . ''
and i think we 've done a good job encouraging that .
in the early days , we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand , you know , because , you know , you 'd never want to change your logo .
`` and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed , and he said , `` you know , i 'm sleeping a lot . '' ''
so with that , maybe i can switch back to the world .
and that 's unlike many of our competitors .
how many creationists do we have in the room ?
beaver dams , yes . hoover dam , no .
what do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves , fruits of the tree of life , and hence , in some sense , obeying evolutionary rules ?
it 's a little brain worm .
it 's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle .
so there 's nothing in it for the ant .
this is all on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness , of course .
hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others .
and no other species does anything at all like it .
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
`` richard dawkins , whom you 'll be hearing later in the day , invented the term `` '' memes , '' '' and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book `` '' the selfish gene . '' '' now here am i talking about his idea . ''
i 'm responsible for what i say about memes .
a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude .
and , in principle , it could 've gone on forever , with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts .
and we 're doing it again .
these memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures .
what you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
then came bollywood .
but keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement .
the industry is 15 years old .
my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia .
we thought this was a good story .
so i guess it 's a world premier .
bernard pinayon agbaosi : we have been so deep into the foreign movies .
come on . do n't run away . come back . come back .
smw : you can now walk the street and see a role model .
you see the person live .
it’s not just what you see in the picture .
man : see you . bye .
man : let 's go .
but here , we improvise these items , like the gunshots .
like they go , here , now , now , you see the gun there , but you wo n't see any guns shot , we use knock-out .
you know , this is nollywood , where the magic lives .
`` a woman told me , `` '' when i see a nollywood film , i can relax , i really — i can breathe better . '' '' there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience . ''
it’s technology . i’m very interested in it and i really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed , you know , the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be .
incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars .
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .
and there 's one thing , one small challenge that i have for you , and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling .
and i think this is really the theme of this session .
they can be rented for pennies .
fs : oh , the format — thank you for the question . yes , it 's vcds .
ca : so on the streets , are film casts ... ?
two quickly became 26 .
just last month , i installed these four horsemen of the apocalypse in the thames river , in central london , right in front of the houses of parliament , putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things .
i 've always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it 's a big bit .
i had all these stories and ideas , and i wanted to share them with people , but physiologically , i could n't do it .
so on the week of my 30th birthday , i decided i was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me .
there were like 20 people there .
next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion . ( laughter ) so your mouth gets dry , and blood is routed away from your extremities , so your fingers do n't work anymore .
it was so bad .
that night i promised myself : i would go back every week until i was n't nervous anymore .
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease .
( applause ) can i have a sip of water ?
this is a dream of the ages .
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant .
and it is n't until twice as long that they 're all dead .
it 's active . you ca n't tell the difference really .
but everything else is just lying there .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
so this is altogether really , really interesting .
and it 's looking like that 's the case .
so it 's an ancient pathway , because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals .
so for example , there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city .
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age-related disease ?
how could that work ?
so foxo turns on a lot of genes .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
we do n't know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
let me get this straight .
although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
( laughter ) there 's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence .
for example , there are some tortoises called blanding 's turtles .
for the past decade , i 've been studying non-state armed groups : armed organizations like terrorists , insurgents or militias .
now , these activities are keys .
filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach .
that thin sliver you see here , that 's africa .
it 's not possible — it does n't work .
and so we need to find better ways of providing care .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa — mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
we 're all hiv-positive .
mothers take care of the children , take care of the home .
they 're working , or they 're not part of the household .
these mothers , we call them mentor mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being hiv-positive , who need support and education .
they go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education , training .
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
and so the father and the mother , together , go through the counseling and the testing .
and it 's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves , how to disclose how to take medicines .
and so the mentor mother went along with .
i 'm hiv-positive .
they change the way communities think — we need to change attitudes to hiv .
our health care systems are broken .
they 're not going to work the way they 're currently designed .
those who are hiv-negative must know how to stay negative .
come on , raise your hands .
how many of you are checking it right now ?
so this coal will last a little bit more than a month .
if you wanted to light this bulb for a year , you 'd need this much coal .
graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood , asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans .
turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
they had zero impact on energy consumption .
it was as if the grad students had n't shown up at all .
so what does this tell us ?
now , the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours , but for the rest of us , two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in st. louis and salt lake city combined for more than a year .
well , in most places , utility regulation has n't changed much since thomas edison .
she asked me what i did for a living , and i told her , i work with utilities to help people save energy .
historically , we 've always acted as victims of something or somebody .
and now of the zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
what if none of these things is the problem ?
i 'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
we want to pretend that mexico has the flu .
and if we do n't do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
we need to move mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico .
`` they sent a message to the kidnappers : `` '' if you want your ransom come and get it . ''
`` we 'll be waiting for you right here . '' '' they stayed there . ''
seven days later , eric was set free and was able to return home .
this is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
on july 7th , 2009 , benjamín le barón was murdered .
he keeps organizing .
these heroic acts are present all over the country .
i 've traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have .
i think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a mexican is to insult their mother .
what are we going to do ?
but we are many more .
it then became open source , and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location .
and the reason is , because although innovation , of course , takes place in big businesses , takes place in world-class universities , it also takes place in the fringes , because those on the fringes — the pariahs , the outcasts — they 're often the most creative , because they have to be .
( laughter ) not that i 'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics .
`` there is even , most beautifully of all , a `` '' report this item '' '' button . ''
something far simpler than that .
prices tend to go down , product quality tends to go up , and the vendors are attentive , they 're polite , they 're consumer-centric , offering you all manner of special deals , one-offs , buy-one-get-one-frees , free delivery , to keep you happy .
but , on the other hand , if you are going to take drugs , you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality , which is incredibly important if you 're taking drugs .
the vendor , who would see that i 'd sent it , would be confident that they could then send the product to me , and then when i received it , at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction — vendor , buyer , site administrator — would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature , and then the money would be transferred .
so if you 're clever , you can try and work out who 's behind them .
check grams , the search engine .
now , whatever you think about the morality of these sites — and i submit that it 's not actually an easy question — the creation of functioning , competitive , anonymous markets , where nobody knows who anybody else is , constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities , is a staggering achievement , a phenomenal achievement .
the more time we spend online , the more we worry about them , and those surveys show our worries are growing .
and there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online — default encrypted messaging services .
the dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle-blowers .
that 's good news if you care about liberty .
it 's good news if you care about freedom .
actually , for 10 years .
and first , i commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
and about five years ago , we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u.k .
and all of this will be done within the public system , funded by public money , but independently run .
they found it much more motivational , much more exciting than traditional education .
`` the minister of education down south in london described himself as a `` '' big fan . '' '' and the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today . ''
it spread almost entirely through word of mouth , virally , across teachers , parents , people involved in education .
they found resources like khan academy and they were able to fill in those gaps and master those concepts , and that reinforced their mindset that it was n't fixed ; that they actually were capable of learning mathematics .
it 's the way you would learn a martial art .
on that test , maybe i get a 75 percent , maybe you get a 90 percent , maybe you get a 95 percent .
it means that you should just keep working on it .
and all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen in the actual classroom .
to appreciate what we 're talking about and the tragedy of lost potential here , i 'd like to give a little bit of a thought experiment .
in the industrial age , society was a pyramid .
i mean , think about the type of equity we can we have , and the rate at which civilization could even progress .
and so , i 'm pretty optimistic about it .
let me start , if i may , with a little bit of history .
most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen .
what 's special about the wikipedia is the way it 's produced .
it 's on a server or it 's on a p.c .
now , if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points , a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten-thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data , this just in the last 10 or 11 years .
so essentially what 's happening here , and genomics is merely one example of this , is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it , and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated .
the polarization of scale economies towards the very small — small is beautiful — allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production .
that is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale .
it means , for example , that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure , where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy , not something that the strategy presupposes .
we need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously .
( applause )
a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post-industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time .
it really goes beyond distinction .
and what 's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it 's not an image , it 's not an artifact , actually it 's a space , and it 's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
the question is , is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs ?
and around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
the hirshhorn sits among the mall 's monumental institutions .
and it has to be free .
to 130 feet , except for spires , towers , domes and minarets .
it glows from within , it 's translucent .
and then it 's ballasted with water at the very bottom .
but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
this is a very , very unusual building in that there 's no gravity load , but there 's load in every direction .
and this is the space in action .
the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity .
and if i took that journey , no matter whether it failed or succeeded , it would be completely irrelevant .
there was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together — that we 're in this together , and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated , then that might be the key to humanity 's survival .
so obviously we did n't have any money .
he was a prisoner of war .
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki .
and that 's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .
`` a letter came through from the dalai lama saying , `` '' this is an amazing thing . come and see me . ''
and then dr. oscar arias came forward .
i 'm cutting my hair , it 's getting short and long , because every time i saw kofi annan , i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it , and that was kind of what was going on .
and then we were listening to the people . we were documenting everywhere .
76 countries in the last 12 years , i 've visited .
and then on the seventh of september , i was invited to new york .
`` and now i was thinking , `` '' well , the press it really going to hear this story . '' '' and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day . ''
and i 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about .
`` but even if it does n't , at least the door is open and there 's a chance . '' '' and so i went back to london , and i went and saw this chap , jude law . ''
and then we went home . we 'd sort of done it .
and then suddenly , i obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
`` and then that year , that year , 2008 , this isaf statement from kabul , afghanistan , september 17th : `` '' general stanley mcchrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan , announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september . '' '' they were saying they would stop . ''
and we will utilize all kinds of things — have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website , sign the petition .
and you can see the education box there .
we 'll utilize sport and football .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
thank you very much . thank you .
trying to replace pancreas , trying to replace nerves that can help us with parkinson 's .
would n't it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
you see the scar form .
and that scar actually grows out a new limb .
so , salamanders can do it .
your bones regenerate every 10 years .
at the time of injury or disease , the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body .
it basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it 's organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside .
so , how can we harness that power ?
and you see that it is injured .
that 's exactly what you see here .
and then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra .
what do we do now , if you have injury for larger organs ?
then we can start to use cells .
it disintegrates a few months later .
it 's bringing the cells into the body . it 's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away .
you now have your fully seeded scaffold .
you then exercise it , as what you saw on that tape .
it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
that 's the oven-like device ; once it 's coated it gets placed there .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs .
so , for example on the left panel , top panel , you see a liver .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
and that 's actually what you 're seeing .
if you present with a diseased wind pipe we 'd like to take cells from your windpipe .
some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span .
but it takes a lot to get there .
( laughter ) i 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny . ( laughter )
but actually method a is the correct approach .
and now i can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever i want .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital , probably squeaky clean .
the main american manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to china because it 's the world 's biggest supplier of pigs .
so a couple of years ago , we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world , because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain .
the problem was that it killed more people .
`` and so you 're asking yourself , `` '' how come the u.s. food and drug administration allowed this to happen ? ''
this is offshore .
there are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in china alone .
in fact , about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore , particularly china and india , and we do n't have a governance system .
we do n't have a system to ensure that human rights , basic dignity , are ensured .
they do n't employ those workers .
so what we 've been able to do is we 've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain , that of the multinational company , and get them to do the right thing , get them to use that power for good , to deliver the key public goods .
they were n't set up to do this . they 're set up to make money .
they have resources , and if we can add the will , the commitment , they know how to deliver that product .
now , getting there is not easy .
transparency is absolutely critical to this .
you do n't need to believe me . you should n't believe me .
call it network governance . call it what you will .
just look at pandemics — swine flu , bird flu , h1n1 .
they did n't say money .
`` they said , `` '' the people who employ us treat us like we are less than human , like we do n't exist . ''
`` please ask them to treat us like human beings . '' '' that 's my simple understanding of human rights . ''
so i appeal to you .
if , of course , that were true , there would be no innovation , and nobody could make any money .
this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
how long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged shanghai automotive super-efficient car ?
now , in order to avoid these problems , whatever you think they 're worth , it 's actually not that complicated .
we can save half the oil by using it more efficiently , at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel .
and compared with the official forecast , that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025 , which is half of what we 've been paying lately , that will save 70 billion dollars a year , starting quite soon .
and protect another million jobs now at risk , mainly in auto-making .
for example , this opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon .
this muscle car from toyota : 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gallon . i 'll say more later about this .
and we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull , and flip the market .
but then the next generation of planes saves about half .
again , much cheaper than buying the fuel .
whereas if we made them heavy , they 'd be both hostile and inefficient .
and when you make them light in the right way , that can be simpler and cheaper to make .
and if you want , you can lay color in the mold , and get rid of the paint shop .
or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance , or if we used it as hydrogen , which is more profitable and efficient , we 'd get rid of the domestic oil too .
then the legacy airlines ca n't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills , but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that , there are ways to finance it .
then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining , and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates , and get out of our own way in other ways .
this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life .
weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent . so the sunny ones swirl around , the cloudy ones float along , the rainy ones fall down , and the snowy ones flutter to the ground .
finally , location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map , giving you a sense of their geographic distribution .
so , really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .
stories take place in a certain area . they have contexts .
they have colors . what do they look like ?
you can start to see some of the story here , told by color .
so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying .
`` so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in `` '' the whale hunt '' '' and the two whales that were killed down here . ''
it 's an incredibly non-materialistic culture , where people do n't have a lot , but they 're incredibly happy .
and then when they answered , i would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold .
( laughter ) and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life , what makes them happy .
so i 'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did , some of the people i spoke with .
`` she was wearing this silver ring that had the word `` '' love '' '' engraved on it , and she 'd found it in the road somewhere . ''
he wanted to live a long life at the monastery .
an 81-year-old itinerant farmer .
he was eating this orange , sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into , and since there was so much saliva on his hands , this orange paste started to form on his palms .
jh : 10 years ? woman : yes , yes . jh : 10 years , that 's a long time .
jh : are you hoping to ?
thanks very much .
i 'd like for you to picture it in your mind .
you 'll eat countless gourmet meals .
it 's actually the same person . it 's just one skeleton .
( laughter ) we all look the same inside , believe me .
the creases in the material and the sort of nuances .
and if it 's well made i show it , if it 's badly made i show it .
and should that pig have grown , unfortunately it was dead , it would have certainly been dead after i x-rayed it , with the amount of radiation i used anyway .
and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
and this shows how i do my process of same-size x-rays .
but there are four x-ray plates .
so , i like to use them .
that flower does n't come in bright orange , i do n't think .
to get the detail in a feather , believe me , if there is anyone out here who knows anything about x-rays , that 's quite a challenge .
video : ( music ) the thing in there is very dangerous .
( music ) it has human connotations .
the fact that it 's a child 's toy that we all recognize , but also it looks like it 's a robot , and it comes from a sci-fi genus .
so , to avoid that — i have to avoid it somehow — is i use dead people .
and if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car , you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works .
i 'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form .
but that 's it . i 'm done . thank you very much .
well today we 're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character — this leopard .
( laughter ) beverly 's clearly one of them , and this little leopard , legadema , is another , and she changed our lives .
when her mother would go off hunting , we would stay and film .
and early on , a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us .
`` she 's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us . '' '' well , we need n't have worried . ''
she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us , sat next to us , shivering , with her back towards dereck , and looking out .
so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name .
bj : but through our investigation , we have to seek the wildest places in africa .
bj : and then of course , the challenge is knowing when to turn around .
and it was n't a moment , and these lions came back towards us , and beverly was able to get a great photograph .
dj : it was amazing , because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name , eetwidomayloh , represents .
so just when you think it 's all over , something else happens , some spark gets into you , some sort of will to fight — that iron will that we all have , that this elephant has , that conservation has , that big cats have .
( applause ) now back to the leopard .
we were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
and of course , we knew now that she was going to survive .
dj : okay , so she was a little bit rough .
there 's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into africa .
`` and so what we are doing , in february , we 're bringing out a film called `` '' the last lion , '' '' and `` '' the last lion '' '' is exactly what is happening right now . ''
science starts with observation , but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence , isolate them , and test them with scientific rigor .
the incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide .
now harry butler , who most australians would know is a famous naturalist , had spent a lot of time in the marine environment .
the next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear , and to that end , i invited ray smith , a surfer , industrial designer , wetsuit designer , and in fact the guy that designed the original quiksilver logo , to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear .
so this takes that banding idea , takes that banding idea , it 's highly visible , provides a highly disruptive profile , and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food , and potentially even create confusion for the shark .
there are three panels on this suit , and in any given conditions , one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially , leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column .
and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think .
( laughter ) so we have to bait the rig , because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence , and by baiting the rig , we 're obviously changing shark behavior .
the way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait , wrap it in a neoprene skin , and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig .
great white sharks are more confident than the tigers , and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig , so a black neoprene wetsuit , and going straight to the bottom , coming up and engaging .
( applause ) and eduardo . ( applause )
well , to my mind , rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention , we 've paid attention to the biological evidence , we 've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence , and we 've used science as a tool for translation , translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind .
( applause )
i would love to share with you a story .
it was venerable .
( music ) for this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
and it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology , because i think i know very little about that — i 'm not a biologist — so everything i know about it can be said in one minute .
i want to talk about something quite different , which is what i know about , and that is astronomy .
go out a bit further , you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune , way out , far from the sun , that 's where the real estate really begins .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it .
and of course , that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime , so in canada that 's illegal . in new zealand , it 's legal , because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits , because the rabbits compete with the sheep in new zealand .
we 're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
if we do n't find them , then we can create them ourselves .
( laughter ) that 's another wonderful opportunity that 's opening .
that would be a fun thing to do .
in fact , i 've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear .
and i just ate it up .
i drew , and i drew , and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family , i could draw , do what i wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak — i was very shy — and i could still get approval .
because women are on the ground floor , and we know the traditions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table .
during the civil rights movement , the assassinations , the watergate hearings and then the feminist movement , and i think i was drawing , trying to figure out what was going on .
it did n't work .
but i found my place .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
but in the u.s. , whenever africa came up , people turned to me .
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
`` i told him that i had just read a novel called `` '' american psycho '' '' — ( laughter ) — and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers . ( laughter ) ''
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
what if my mother had told us that fide 's family was poor and hardworking ?
or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
we 've been told for 40 years already that they 're coming soon .
and this is an x-ray picture of a real beetle , and a swiss watch , back from '88 . you look at that — what was true then is certainly true today .
let 's summon the best designer , the mother of all designers .
you look at it and you see it has four legs , the machine does n't know if it 's a snake , if it 's a tree , it does n't have any idea what it looks like , but it 's going to try to find that out .
( applause ) so , we 'll move forward to a different idea .
they would , in fact , be part of a sierra leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power .
if your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable , you will not use your leg , and that is just simply unacceptable in our age .
i used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient 's anatomy , then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces , and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture .
`` and definitively , i do n't know why i am here , but — you know the nightmare you can have , like you are an impostor , you arrive at the opera , and they push you , `` '' you must sing ! '' '' i do n't know . ( laughter ) so , so , because i have nothing to show , nothing to say , we shall try to speak about something else . ''
i do n't try to design the toothbrush .
because there is different types of design .
can you imagine ? it 's very symbolic .
because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today .
and if we do n't deeply understand , if we do n't integrate that we are mutants , we completely miss the story .
`` you know , we mutate during four billion years before , but now , because it 's me , we stop . fin . ( laughter ) for the end , for the eternity , it is one with a red jacket . '' '' something like that . i am not sure of that . ( laughter ) because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that . ''
i can explain you . i shall try .
and you will fall , and you will die . dangerous .
i raise the angle of vision , but it 's still very — selfish , selfish , egoiste — yes , selfish .
`` if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , `` '' i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , '' '' something like that . ''
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
take care , in this training , to be a good mutant .
out , more of the horizontal . you are an intelligence .
never forget — like that , like that .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .
because it 's not , the barbaria we have today , it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think .
but i know that even i do it the best possible — that 's why i 'm the best — it 's nothing .
because the scenario of this civilization — about love , progress , and things like that — it 's ok , but there is so many different , other scenarios of other civilizations .
we have just to finish the story .
we give you the best tools , the best tools , and now , do it .
that — you know , i was born thinking about things that way , and i had always been like a little scientist guy .
but what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there , and see what would happen inside there .
i do that on the weekend . and like — what i 'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment .
charles ii was kind of saying , you know , you should keep that — let 's make a place where you can do this stuff where people do n't get so — you know , we do n't want the — we do n't want to get the people mad at me again . and so — because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that , that 's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble .
it 's not clear ; actually sparklers will , but they did n't know that .
they did n't have sparklers . but , they — ( laughter ) — you can make up rules , but they have to relate only to the things that you 've been able to demonstrate .
audience : here .
just to see what would happen , if you mixed it together .
and then i tried the melting business , and i melted it .
and i 'd better get permission from the government .
if i 'd have waited around for that , i would have never — the frog would have died , you know .
at any rate , i bring it up because it 's a good story , and he said , tell personal things , you know , and that 's a personal — i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife , but that would be too personal , would n't it .
but if you go to authority , and you always do n't — you do n't always get the right answer , see .
and they got involved in it , and the scientific and industrial establishment was born , and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money , you know , because it was suddenly available .
you want to be rich , you be a businessman .
so the theory 's kaput — it 's nothing .
there is n't a problem with global warming any longer , so we can — you know , they 're funding .
it requires physicists who work with biologists , with mathematicians and computer scientists , and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems .
they are very social animals .
and they live in maternity colonies , which means that every spring , the females meet after the winter hibernation , and they stay together for about six months to rear their young , and they all carry a very small chip , which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes , we know where she is , and more importantly , we know with whom she is .
so how could it be that the bats maintain this complex , stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities ?
it 's a mathematical model , but it 's not complicated .
moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment .
when these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
they adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat .
for examples , in sea horses or in koalas , in fact , it is the males who take care of the young always .
matthieu 's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
compassion is fun .
what if compassion is also profitable ?
it 's a company that thrives on idealism .
and they do n't usually ask for permission ; they just go ahead and do it , and then other googlers join in , and it just gets bigger and bigger .
they just go ahead and start a fundraiser .
and they raise enough money to build this hospital — the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people .
`` it was two persons saying , `` '' let 's do this , '' '' and the company said , `` '' yes . '' '' so it turns out that google is a compassionate company , because googlers found compassion to be fun . ''
so what are they ?
what does that mean ?
there are three components of compassion .
`` there is the affective component , which is , `` '' i feel for you . '' '' there is the cognitive component , which is , `` '' i understand you . '' '' and there is a motivational component , which is , `` '' i want to help you . '' '' so what has this got to do with business leadership ? ''
`` and he calls them `` '' level 5 leaders . '' '' these are leaders who , in addition to being highly capable , possess two important qualities , and they are humility and ambition . these are leaders ''
the second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce .
it makes us a highly effective company .
leadership training in google , for example , places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities , such as self-awareness , self-mastery , empathy and compassion , because we believe that leadership begins with character .
so i 'm an engineer by training , but i 'm one of the creators and instructors of this course , which i find kind of funny , because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence .
and this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence .
and once you can do that , you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery .
and in closing , i want to end the same place i started , with happiness .
wk : yeah . i 'm 19 years now .
ca : what , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
wk : yeah .
( applause ) ca : so you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book .
ca : the book had three , yours had four .
ca : and what did you make the windmill out of ?
ca : so this one would have to be bigger ?
wk : yeah .
ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
`` and i 've always been nervous about the term `` '' futurist , '' '' because you seem doomed to failure because you ca n't really predict it . ''
this is headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very , very bright individuals .
i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
so now i 'm going to show you the hands-free , autonomous self-replication .
not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
so , this actually applied to the problem of — so there 's a half a billion to a billion people in the world do n't have access to cheap eyeglasses .
if it 's elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens .
this is three minutes of uv light .
now you 've finished the lens , you literally pop it out .
under a different load , it 's a different structure . and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor .
so that means anything you do , or anything you make , you produce a sequence of steps — and i think lego in the '70s nailed this , and they did it most elegantly .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe — it 's sort of an analog computer .
but it 's definitely an interesting new worldview .
but , you know , this is another way to look at the — if you abstract again , this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe .
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
but it turns out , what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us , when put in certain contexts , will actually make very specific mistakes .
the errors we make are actually predictable .
and they 're actually immune to lots of evidence .
when we get negative feedback , we still , the next time we 're face with a certain context , tend to make the same errors .
and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature .
if this was the case , we 'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error .
these guys are new world primates , which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago .
what if we put holly into the same context as humans ?
and so this is the kind of thing we decided to do .
because , you know , it 's great for us , but bad for humans .
here 's felix , i think . he 's our alpha male ; he 's a kind of big guy .
we just allowed them to pick this up on their own .
upon entering the market — it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because , as the monkeys entered the door of the market , a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here — two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from .
here 's a monkey-eye-view . monkeys are shorter , so it 's a little short .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
when we introduced sales , we saw the monkeys paid attention to that .
so we said , this looks bad .
so we said , let 's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges , or certain kinds of economic experiments .
if it comes up heads , you 're going to get a thousand dollars more .
i 'm just going to give you 500 bucks .
you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .
you might say , eh , that 's not really irrational .
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
now , you 're going to be deciding how you 're going to lose money , but you 're going to get the same choice .
so what 's going on ?
one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms .
they 're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer — because they 're evaluating them in relative terms .
the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .
we introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen .
but they 're going to give the monkeys bonuses .
but this is the same choice you guys just faced .
every single time , he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
that 's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around — really , really old .
when you 're watching your stocks plummet into the red , when you 're watching your house price go down , you 're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .
we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means , seemingly pretty easily .
`` it was camus who once said that , `` '' man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is . '' '' but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them . ''
thank you .
( applause )
we 're going to talk — my — a new lecture , just for ted — and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted , and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness — or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there 's something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it 's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
way . you go see a movie . and it has an unexpected twist — something that you did n't expect — and you find a joyful experience . you look at those sort of illusions in my book and it 's not as what you 'd expect . and there 's something joyful about it . and it 's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . so , what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if i can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . i mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but i 'm going to try
and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation , about shape , about color and so forth and it 's very primal . and it 's an interesting question to ponder , why these things — we find these things joyful . why would we find them joyful ? so , here 's something that lionel did a while ago . i like these sort of little things like this .
we can violate your expectations on representation — what an image represents . what do you see here ?
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
will i wake them up ? is it ok to call ?
right ? so you can imagine how confusing that is .
`` again , we did n't start out thinking , `` '' oh , let 's invent a language . '' '' it was just very confusing . ''
`` i remember somebody walked up to me and said , `` i would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow , on the rover . '' ''
but even the earth daylight could confuse us .
and he 'd gotten used to it .
this is david oh , one of our flight directors , and he 's at the beach in los angeles with his family at 1:00 in the morning .
and they were on dad 's work schedule .
and one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in los angeles at 3:00 in the morning when there 's no traffic .
so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians , and everyone else as earthlings .
in fact , there were sleep researchers who actually were studying us because it was so unusual for humans to try to extend their day .
what it means in terms of the distances between them , how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time .
they were opening biohacker spaces , and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did , more regulations , less resources .
it 's a vibrant , global community of hackerspaces , and this is just the beginning .
we genetically engineer bacteria .
we hack hardware , software , wetware , and , of course , the code of life .
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
let me show you what you could do right now .
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what 's up there .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
this is such a new area , and as we say back in brooklyn , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet . ( laughter ) ( applause )
and as he did , he told me how he had come to the city from his village .
his dream was to be a teacher .
so we turned off the wide , crowded streets , and we began bumping down rough , wild alleyways .
there were broken shacks all around .
i could get mugged or drugged or something worse .
so when we said goodbye that night , i realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel , which is to take a plunge , to go inwardly as well as outwardly to places you would never go otherwise , to venture into uncertainty , ambiguity , even fear .
the opposite of knowledge , in other words , is n't always ignorance .
`` `` what 's the best way to raise children ? '' ''
and they learned , a little too late , perhaps , that there are certainly some things that we need to know , but there are many , many more that are better left unexplored .
i had been spending 20 years in classrooms collecting facts , and i was actually in the information business , writing articles for time magazine .
and now that i 've been there for 28 years , i really could n't tell you very much at all about my adopted home .
but the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance .
every morning in japan , as the sun is flooding into our little apartment , i take great pains not to consult the weather forecast , because if i do , my mind will be overclouded , distracted , even when the day is bright .
on simplicity . what a great way to start .
`` you know , there 's also something called the `` '' complete idiot 's guide ? '' '' there 's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense . ''
we like to have technology make us feel bad , for some strange reason .
( laughter ) so , i looked for a different show to watch .
`` so , i opened up this tv guide thing , and on the e ! channel , this `` '' simple life '' '' show is very popular . ''
`` it 's a very simple sign , it says , `` '' road '' '' and `` '' road approaching . '' '' so i 'm mostly driving along , okay , and then i saw this sign . ''
we love relationships — very complex . so we love this kind of stuff .
but looking way back , when i was a child — you see , i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it 's important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
and she was a tedster , exactly , and she showed us , she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again .
i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .
`` so , i 've always been googling this word , `` '' human , '' '' to find out how many hits i get . ''
so , somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined , i think .
lots of complex stuff .
i built things in a time-graphics dimension .
computer programs are essentially trees , and when you make art with a computer program , there 's kind of a problem .
i took these to tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
`` and as a child , i 'd hear that song , you know , `` oh , beautiful , for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain , '' so i made this amber waves image . ''
cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos .
`` ( laughter ) so , i was in the cape one time , and i typed the word `` '' simplicity , '' '' and i discovered , in this weird , m. night shyamalan way , that i discovered [ the ] letters , m , i , t. you know the word ? ''
so , i thought , maybe i 'll do this for the next twenty years or something .
in japan , they say that sushi is challenging .
you can say the small cookie has godiva chocolate bits in it , but it does n't work . they want the big cookie .
strangely , not the big pile . so , i think it 's as simple as this .
why is this happening ?
it 's like the air .
he helped us understand that social media 's becoming social production .
ibm gave away 400 million dollars of software to the linux movement , and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff .
we need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research .
and i 'm not talking about the motherhood sense here .
you know , one word : tunisia .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
there was no concept of progress .
and there 's leadership , but there 's no one leader .
well , the murmuration functions to record a number of principles , and they 're basically the principles that i have described to you today .
and there 's a real sense of interdependence , that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective .
and in my idea , heaven is satisfied curiosity .
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you 're reading , there 's something really soothing and easy .
but it 's not only that .
and of course , you can imagine , with humble masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred .
so , everybody 's always suggesting new humble masterpieces , and at moma we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces .
but design — oh , my god .
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because , as you know , israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies .
and then they make a little tent for the baby .
however cruel , however ruthless you can think this is it 's a great design , and it is miles away from the fancy furniture , but still , it 's part of my same field of passion .
it was beautiful — it was called personal skies .
the idea behind her work was that at that time , everybody was saying you have to really divide your life .
and then when 9/11 happened , i had a shock and i canceled the exhibition until , slowly but surely , it came back — as a half-full glass instead of half-empty — and it was about protection and safety .
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury , and i did n't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .
this is cuba , and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell , and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks .
i think that this is a strange moment .
and that 's why designers , more and more , are working on behaviors rather than on objects .
for instance , this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it 's time for you to take the medicine , so the child has to go — pffff ! — to release and relieve the container itself .
thank you . ( applause )
a conflict that was fought during the cold war .
and we left .
we 'll take that dna and then we 'll compare it with the dna of the families , of course .
and what you see there is the state following individuals , people that , like you , wanted to change their country , and they jotted everything down .
the dna of that body also matched the dna of that family .
but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march 29 , 1984 .
it 's very ironic .
at the one hand , we have 1.2 kilos , and at the other hand 0.6 kilos .
these islands — mauritius , rodrigues , and réunion — along with the island of madagascar , they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world .
we know plants have a fundamental role to play .
here 's a data point : 1.4 percent of the entire land surface is home to 40 percent of the species of higher plants , 35 percent of the species of vertebrates , and this 1.4 percent represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world , and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface already provides for 35 percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on .
now , let 's go back again to that first plant i showed you , the one , of course , with different-shaped leaves and different sizes , terminalia bentzoe , subspecies bentzoe , a plant only found in mauritius .
while we humans , we are happy in our comfort zone , these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved , and they do n't react — endemic plants do n't react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem , and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change , for example , is posing to these plants .
now if you have a problem in the community , meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem , and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community .
now , if you open the fruit of the baobab , you 'll see a white , floury pulp , which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein , more protein than in human milk .
we have six species yet in madagascar , and we do n't know what is the potential of this plant , but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be threatened with extinction .
let me take you to africa again , and introduce you to one of my very favorite , the resurrection plant .
( laughter ) now , this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought , which enables it to withstand up to 98 percent dehydration over the period of a year without damage , and yet it can regenerate itself almost completely overnight , over 24 hours , and flower .
you know why ? because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant .
in 1835 , james gordon bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in new york city .
`` now , the term `` '' information society , '' '' `` '' information economy , '' '' for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution . but in fact , for purposes of understanding what 's happening today , that 's wrong . because for 150 years , we 've had an information economy . ''
now , let me tell you a different story . around june 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bombshell .
and she 'll come to encarta , one of the main online encyclopedias .
another portion is not only how content is produced , but how relevance is produced .
the claim to fame of yahoo ! was , we hire people to look — originally , not anymore — we hire people to look at websites and tell you — if they 're in the index , they 're good . this , on the other hand , is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project , each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about , to say , this is good . so , this is the open directory project , with 60,000 volunteers , each one spending a little bit of time , as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees . no one owns it , no one owns the output ,
but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
but it 's not the only one .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social relations .
but it 's also a new source of opportunities for businesses .
i will deliver something based on what happens . it 's very scary — that 's what google does , essentially .
it is the critical long-term shift caused by the internet .
and what i 'm wondering is , of those three things , is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma ?
but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people .
we can talk about cancer and we can support one another .
it was at that point where i felt like , oh my god , this is just taking over my life .
we all know that the way to cope with trauma , with loss , with any life-changing experience , is to find meaning .
do n't let it claim you .
`` and at that point , her two daughters got up and said , `` we 're going to go get coffee . '' ''
she felt crucified by her experience , but she did n't want to let that crucified self die .
the christian story , jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb before he was resurrected .
we have to let that crucified self die so that a new self , a truer self , is born .
maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming .
so perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me .
i started to imagine what this would look like .
this is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body .
taking this idea further , i started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
`` i mean , this is the super ultimate `` '' why '' '' question ? ''
he does n't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of .
i do n't have any slides so i 'm going to mime my visuals , so use your imaginations .
okay ? now that 's the equation .
god speaks in a more formal english .
and to a buddhist , the world is just a whole lot of nothing .
science is our best guide to the nature of reality , and the most fundamental science is physics .
`` stephen hawking is one of these physicists , more recently alex vilenkin , and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine , lawrence krauss , who wrote a book called `` a universe from nothing , '' and lawrence thinks that he 's given — he 's a militant atheist , by the way , so he 's gotten god out of the picture . ''
now , lawrence thinks he 's an atheist , but he 's still in thrall to a religious worldview .
they do n't exist outside the world .
what breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe ?
`` i think that brian greene is in the audience , and he has written a book called `` '' the elegant universe . '' '' he claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant . ''
the fullest possible reality , that 's special .
it can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between .
but if it 's just one of these random , generic realities , there 's no further explanation for it .
that 's between a googol and a googolplex .
do we want to live in a special reality ?
so my choices are meaningless .
and i know you feel it .
all the points , all the lines — it 's incredible .
is n't it amazing ?
in youngmenowme , the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult .
( applause ) ( laughter ) my favorite of these photos , which i could n't find , is there 's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap , and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny , little old lady peaking over his shoulder .
here 's how the song goes .
and let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job .
no , no , no , shush . we 've got to go quickly .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
`` and have to do something with it . '' '' hundreds of remixes came back — lots of different attempts . ''
it was done by a guy named goose .
and it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world .
when they smile — right , you 've seen people stop — all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
it 's also going to now happen in virtual spaces , and we have to get better at figuring that out .
a childhood walk , which is a project where i ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless — like on the route to the bus stop , to a neighbor 's house , and take it inside of google streetview .
right after september 11th , last year , i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it , the way that we excise it from our bodies .
zf : so what i did was i took those voicemails , and with their permission , converted them to mp3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails .
`` `` '' from a 48 to a 52 , may your party 's leadership be as classy as you , but i doubt it . '' '' but the truth was that as this start becoming popular , a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing , which i could also see . ''
and i was protecting the project from it , i realized . i was protecting it — i did n't want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
♫ now everybody sings ♫ ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you 're okay ♫ ♫ you 'll be fine ♫ ♫ just breathe ♫ ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you 're okay ♫ ♫ you 'll be fine ♫ ♫ just breathe ♫ ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you 're okay ♫ ♫ you 'll be fine ♫ ♫ just breathe ♫ thank you .
the future will be more unpredictable .
this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
of course , migration will become even more important .
how do we begin to weave these tapestries together ?
i left south africa , and 15 years later , after thinking i would never go back , i had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of nelson mandela .
i know famous musicians , i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers , all who were looked after children , fostered , adopted or orphaned , and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background , as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground , as if it were somehow kryptonite , as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside . children in care , who 've had a life in care , deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood .
it is that simple .
`` so anyway , she comes here , 1967 , she 's pregnant , and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie , and she lands months before the enoch powell speech , the `` '' rivers of blood '' '' speech . ''
it 's her plan . you know , i have to say this in the houses — it 's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies . but the social worker , he had a different agenda .
i was norman mark greenwood .
`` but i would always answer myself , `` '' yes , of course you can . '' '' ( laughter ) and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil . ''
now , in their religiosity , in their naivete , my mom and dad , which i believed them to be forever , as they said they were , my mom and dad conceived that i had the devil inside of me .
but because i had no family to inquire about me , they could do anything to me .
that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder .
i have to tell this story .
i also went fishing .
( laughter ) because i had never fished , this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use .
next stop : almost heaven , a cabin i rented for myself in coeur d'alene , in the beautiful north idaho panhandle .
so what 's a resident to do to fit in ?
what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around .
about a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of aryan nations , the white supremacist group .
among the many memorable episodes of that retreat ... ( laughter )
whitopian dreaming , whitopia migration , is a push-pull phenomenon , full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls , and whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias .
the reality is that many white americans are affable and kind .
interpersonal race relations — how we treat each other as human beings — are vastly better than in my parents ' generation .
as americans , we often find ways to cook for each other , to dance with each other , to host with each other , but why ca n't that translate into how we treat each other as communities ?
and with that said , i 'd like to invite you for a short , brief journey of life through time .
and when it vanishes , earth becomes mars .
but this planet is different — it 's roiling inside .
and where that energy touches water , something new emerges : life .
learn to multiply , thickening in places ...
it learned to move and began to see . the first eyes grew on trilobites .
it took time for life to break away from water , and it still beckons all the time .
in birds , life gained new mobility .
water lilies were among the first .
in australia , a lily turned into a grass tree , and in hawaii , a daisy became a silver sword .
herd safety came with sharpened senses .
walruses adapted with layers of fat . sea lions got sleek .
so who are we ? brothers of masculine chimps , sisters of feminine bonobos ? we are all of them , and more .
tell us about kiribati .
and so this is what we have .
but i think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007 with the fourth assessment report of the ipcc , which made a categorical statement that it is real , it 's human-induced , and it 's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine .
we were worried .
( laughter ) but they are n't supposed to come back .
but , as a country , we have made a commitment that no matter what happens , we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation .
either we live on floating islands , or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe .
and so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people .
they did n't know who i was . they had n't heard of me .
i met also a family who have married the local people here , and so this is what is happening .
i was very angry , very frustrated and then depressed .
can you tell us about that ?
we have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world .
ca : so there 's so many things playing into this .
on the one hand , it may prompt healthier fisheries .
i mean , how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas ?
how do you hold the line ?
or is that being run on a sustainable basis ?
i said , what about the rest ? why do n't you keep it ?
first one is really a question of origins .
if we do spring from a common source , how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe , and in the process generate all of this diversity , the different ways of life , the different appearances , the different languages around the world ?
well , not quite . because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry , our common ancestry with apes .
africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time , due to the vagaries of plate tectonics , floating around the indian ocean .
bumped into eurasia around 16 million years ago , and then we had the first african exodus , as we call it .
and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas , the chimpanzees and us .
so , yes , if you 're talking about our common ancestry with apes , it 's very clear , by looking at the fossil record , we started off here .
but that 's not really the question i 'm asking .
what do i mean by that ?
you 're looking at a great example here .
that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor .
the first person to do this systematically was linnaeus , carl von linne , a swedish botanist , who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet .
well , what i 'm going to talk about today , what i 'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem .
you and your cousins share a grandparent in common .
i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist .
it is a very long , linear molecule , a coded version of how to make another copy of you . it 's your blueprint .
it does n't happen very often . we have a proofreading mechanism built in .
the y chromosome , the piece of dna that makes men men , traces a purely paternal line of descent .
what 's the take-home message ?
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world .
such an amazing story .
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?
so what was going on here ? we were n't covered in ice in africa .
the sea levels were dropping . and africa was turning to desert .
look in the mirror . you 're it . the reason you 're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa — probably somewhere in the region where we 're sitting right now , around 60 , 70 thousand years ago — allowing us not only to survive in africa , but to expand out of africa .
and it 's basically a meat locker .
the grasslands at that time — this was during the last ice age — stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea , and the entire continent was open to them .
now , that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world , the great paleolithic wanderings of our species .
`` and i said , `` '' well , you know , what i 've sketched out here is just that . ''
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost .
so my ancestors come from all over northern europe .
projects around the world — documenting oral poetry in sierra leone , preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza , language revitalization in tajikistan , etc. , etc .
it involves a campaign of letter writing , research and phone calls to access my subjects , which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia .
over a five year period following september 11th , when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders , most notably weapons of mass destruction , i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation , mythology and daily functioning .
this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state , where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water .
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut .
but stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago , like it was locked in the cold war era and had n't necessarily progressed .
and the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
and it 's shown here in its true orientation .
and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice .
it runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
and in 2004 , they developed a channel called alhurra iraq , which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and is broadcast to iraq .
i 'll give you an example from a case .
she saw some similarities in one of the photographs , but could n't quite make a positive identification .
photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals , and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications .
so photographing there , i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction , in both his life and in photography .
he served seven years of a 70 year sentence in kentucky .
he was convicted of rape , kidnapping and robbery , and served seven years of a 47 year sentence .
and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago .
`` he 's 47 years old , slim , spiky hair , describes himself on twitter as `` '' movies , tv , technology , tacos . '' '' and roy price has a very responsible job , because it 's his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that amazon is going to make . ''
so he needs to make sure that he 's really on the right end of this .
so millions of viewers are watching those episodes .
what they do n't realize is that , while they 're watching their shows , actually , they are being watched .
no one . ok , that 's good actually .
so it 's the same principle as amazon and netflix , but now instead of deciding whether a tv show is going to be good or bad , you 're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad .
yes , even google gets it wrong sometimes .
`` they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise would n't have been able to understand at that depth , but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like `` '' house of cards , '' '' that was nowhere in the data . ''
`` which of course was a very safe decision for them , because they could always point at the data , saying , `` this is what the data tells us . '' ''
many of you will ...
but that does not change the basic setup .
now what is a tribe ? a tribe is a group of about 20 — so kind of more than a team — 20 to about 150 people .
and it 's within these tribes that all of our work gets done .
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
you 're all a member of tribes .
now , this is the lowest of the stages .
stage one produces people who do horrible things .
but let 's move on to stage two .
but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb .
i 've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class .
but , in this case , three doctors walk into an elevator .
it is moving from stage three to stage four .
this is from a company called zappos , located outside las vegas .
employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
but they value things like fun . and they value creativity .
now , some of you may not recognize the scene that 's up here .
`` i mean , surely these were just people who preached , `` '' life is great , '' '' right ? ''
and those are the ones that change the world .
i 'd like to show you some examples of this .
which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach , extend your influence , but instead , find someone you do n't know , and find someone else you do n't know , and introduce them .
and ultimately that adds to their values .
you know they do polls , right ?
pretty much everybody else who does polls .
`` `` '' how could we , instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks , or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that , what does the entire world think ? '' '' and they found a way to do the first-ever world poll . ''
`` and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out , `` '' how do we survey the population of sub-saharan africa ? ''
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
and the question that i 'd like to leave you with is this : will your tribes change the world ?
oh , sorry . ( laughter ) this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you 're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes .
so there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
it 's more difficult .
in fact , what skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there — if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
our second type of error is a false negative .
your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
on the other hand , if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind , and it turns out it 's a dangerous predator , you 're lunch .
so the default position is just : believe all patterns are real — all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines , our pattern-seeking brain processes , to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that i 'll come back to .
what do you see here ?
anybody see an object there ?
brugger and his colleague , christine mohr , gave subjects l-dopa .
l-dopa increases dopamine .
in fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities .
so you 're more likely to feel in a euphoric state , creativity , find more patterns .
in fact , it 's the exact same picture side by side .
but anyway , the point is still made .
a fairly famous illusion — it was first done with margaret thatcher .
and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
well , the wind is inanimate ; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent .
because , let 's face it , some patterns are real .
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
so i 'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together .
girl : no .
girl : that would be fine . ( woman : okay . ) so this is a blind test .
spiders are truly global citizens .
spiders are not just everywhere , but they 're extremely diverse .
so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .
( laughter ) we spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider .
in an orb-web-weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what i have depicted here in this picture , let 's start at the one o'clock position , there 's tubuliform silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
minor ampullate silk is used in web construction .
but what , exactly , is spider silk ?
nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family , so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
they 're very repetitive , and they 're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine .
you can also see that there 's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again , so for example there 's a lot of what we call polyalanines , or iterated a 's , aaaaa . there 's ggq . there 's ggy .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we 're actually , you know , testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
so silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .
this is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
i love when i 'm in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
`` it 's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote , `` '' hello , i 'm plato , and as of today , i have a fully introspective consciousness . '' '' ( laughter ) and this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem . ''
another possibility is following the simple assumption that when two words are related , they tend to appear in the same sentences , in the same paragraphs , in the same documents , more often than would be expected just by pure chance .
so in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness , maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness .
and in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate , our respiration , our genes , on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases , we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak , we tweet , we email , we write , can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds .
more specifically , it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were , but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one .
what i tell you today is that we 're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we all have , that we all share , into an algorithm .
to a psychologist .
but instead of pointing at you , which would be gratuitous and intrusive , i thought i would tell you a few facts and stories , in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself .
`` i am the 46th most boring person in the western hemisphere . '' '' or you may say of yourself , `` '' i am intriguing , even if i am regarded by most people as a great , thundering twit . '' '' ( laughter ) but it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent `` '' twitiness '' '' that makes me , as a psychologist , really fascinated by you . ''
so let me explain why this is so .
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
but extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried , but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them .
let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion , because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing , and it helps us understand what i call our three natures .
more or less ?
frankly , speaking as an introverted male , which i will explain later — they are heroic .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we communicate differently , extroverts and introverts .
we found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody .
when we talk , we sometimes talk past each other .
first , his name is tom .
i am seriously introverted .
it 's important that we know this .
is that all we are ?
but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior , or georgian of yours , that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits ?
that make us love you ?
i 'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes .
you 're very agreeable , but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital , to get something for your mom or your child .
and i ca n't wait to tell them about what 's new , what 's exciting , what i ca n't wait to tell them about .
so this is the timeline , and if you 've ever edited video , you 're familiar with this , but instead of clips in the timeline , what you 're looking at is web events pulled into the video .
there are two pop-ups bringing you some other information , and a final article with a link out to the original article .
let 's go to this google map , and i 'll show you how you can edit it .
all you do , go into the timeline , double-click the item , and i 've set it to toronto , because that 's where i 'm from .
the early '70s , i was in college .
in india , we had the naxalite movement , the [ unclear ] movement .
so he designed and went and started a village science program .
many people were inspired by this .
and some of these models — so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube , you can put two matchsticks inside this , and you make a flexible joint .
why use triangles ?
because triangles are the only rigid structures .
and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle , i would make a tetrahedron .
now this was — you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron .
now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon .
it 's a real pump . you could actually pop the balloon .
if you spin something , it tends to fly out .
this is a toy which is made from paper . it 's amazing .
they all study about the food chain .
and this can be , if you had a whole photocopy paper — a4 size paper — you could be in a municipal school , you could be in a government school — a paper , a scale and a pencil — no glue , no scissors .
and this is what newton talked about 400 years back , that white light 's made of seven colors , just by spinning this around .
this is a straw .
whenever current flows through the coil , this becomes an electromagnet .
you 're not able to see how the sound is produced , because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth .
( honk ) so no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations .
this is a touching slate meant for blind children .
it 's basically like a fisherman 's line , a fishing line .
and this is wool over here .
these are two magnets .
small pulley and two strong magnets .
well , this is , again , it 's just a ring , a steel ring with steel nuts .
and this is — you can see — this is a flapping bird .
`` `` '' wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance , and i 'll provide you with good food and drinks . '' '' and the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia . ''
a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down .
and the khan academy videos are there .
now , this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect africa to the rest of the world .
i call them brothers from another mother .
and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi .
it acts as a backup to the internet so that , when the power goes out , it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network .
and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .
consider facit .
gone .
a few years back , i worked closely alongside a european biotech company .
every day was about creating something new .
it 's about search , it 's about discovery , it 's about new products , it 's about new innovations .
our heroes are people who have done exploration : madame curie , picasso , neil armstrong , sir edmund hillary , etc .
we do n't know the answers , we do n't know if we 're going to find them , and we know that the risks are high .
companies become , by nature , less innovative as they become more competent .
so we have lots of great examples .
we discover something , but we do n't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work .
another trap is the success trap .
the first lesson is : get ahead of the crisis .
so when we think one year , innovation is n't really that important .
they need to fund the journey and lead the long term .
third : invite talent .
( applause )
what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .
`` well , `` '' rare earth '' '' actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public . ''
the sun increases in its intensity , in its brightness , and finally , at about 12 billion years after it first started , the earth is consumed by a large sun , and this is what 's left .
and that 's the fate of a planet , too .
`` in that complex record of fossils , there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly , and the father/mother geologists called these `` '' mass extinctions . '' '' all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long , slow climate change , and that really changed in 1980 , in this rocky outcrop near gubbio , where walter alvarez , trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks , which held creatures of the cretaceous period , and the pink rocks above , which held tertiary fossils . ''
and what they found was something unexpected .
you know , you 're gazing upon your very distant ancestors .
( laughter ) this is called paleontological child abuse .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
they really want their world back .
it turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide , and we can detect their presence today — we can see them — but we can also detect their presence in the past .
i am almost extinct — i 'm a paleontologist who collects fossils .
but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide .
and i throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
this is a tracking experiment , and any of you scuba divers , if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever , this is off the great barrier reef .
so , the temperature starts at 25 centigrade , and down it goes , down it goes .
we 're going to save lives , but there 's going to be a cost to it .
but there 's a far worse danger confronting us .
i want to be able to go back to this reef . thank you .
( applause ) chris anderson : i 've just got one question for you , peter .
now , the yap do n't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins , because rai stones can get to be pretty massive .
the largest is about four tons and 12 feet across .
it 's about a collective story that we tell each other about value .
and a lot of times , they do n't .
they are on my phone , they 're on my laptop , they 're on my old phone , they 're in dropbox .
when we combine software and currency , money becomes more than just a static unit of value , and we do n't have to rely on institutions for security .
i have an app on my phone that i can use to buy sashimi .
but it 's not just for small transactions .
all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what bitcoin .
the computer that solves the puzzle publishes its solution to the rest of the network and collects its reward : new bitcoins .
interestingly , things like micro-payments are actually going to change the way security works in our world , because once we 're better able to allocate value , people will use their money and their energies for more constructive things .
right now , it 's like we 're in a world that is seeing the first automobile .
digital money , like the horse and carriage , works pretty well , and the whole world economy is built on it .
programmable money democratizes money .
( laughter ) i 'm 71 .
she is always happy and eternally young .
i keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what i still have .
i love my brain .
i try to live mindfully and be present in the moment .
i hate to be invisible .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
i am working on it every day .
now we 're looking inside .
these processes are too small to be seen directly , even with the best microscopes , so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis .
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses .
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
the payoffs can be huge , though .
one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and i worked on together , and in this way , animation can feed back into the research process .
i was 26 years in the corporate world , trying to make organizations profitable .
we played with the children , and came back home really tired , exhausted , but with images of bright faces , twinkling eyes , and went to sleep .
`` how are you going to replicate ? '' '' it was very difficult not to get scared , not to get daunted . ''
my god ! what a bonding exercise that was .
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
even if it takes me four and a half hours , or three and half hours to finish my book , i do it .
now they have started writing their signature .
such beautiful food , i enjoyed it . it was so beautiful .
and today she wants to be a neurologist .
they are really excelling .
last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
but we began with the idea of one child at a time .
he 's in kindergarten .
in fact , mostly now in other things .
they do n't like that . they think it 's crank . i do n't think it 's crank .
( applause )
and we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of co2 a year .
and they are so excited . that 's the first board off the line .
do n't listen to the people who say you ca n't do this , because anyone can .
and these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs .
thank you so much .
it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one .
this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen .
and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings .
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule , as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .
you need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving .
( applause ) now , i hope that we all know this .
there 's a sense in which it 's obvious , and yet , let me tell you a little story .
it 's a story about lemonade .
and the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it , and called the police , who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital .
`` scott simon , who told this story on npr , said , `` '' rules and procedures may be dumb , but they spare you from thinking . '' '' and , to be fair , rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household . ''
it 's preposterous on its face .
moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations .
and without intending it , by appealing to rules and incentives , we are engaging in a war on wisdom .
here 's an example from chicago kindergarten .
right ?
the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
we need incentives . people have to make a living .
`` ( `` '' although it 's nothing serious , let 's keep an eye on it to make sure it does n't turn into a major lawsuit . '' '' ) and we certainly see it in the world of business . ''
what to do instead ?
i do n't know how many of you remember this : another moral hero , 15 years ago , aaron feuerstein , who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts — they made polartec — the factory burned down .
there are ordinary heroes .
as heads of organizations , we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will .
someone is always watching .
the camera is always on .
i think there is reason for hope .
thank you .
frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value using fewer resources .
now i want to show you how , across emerging markets , entrepreneurs and companies are adopting frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost-effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations .
now let 's go to kenya , a country where half the population uses m-pesa , a mobile payment solution .
do you know that today , there are over 70 million americans today who are underbanked , because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs .
several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for western consumers .
`` when i first saw them , i thought , `` '' holy cow . '' '' literally , because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in nairobi . ''
the first principle is : keep it simple .
companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses , but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity , you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units , like grameen bank has shown .
these african students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they do n't have any electricity at home .
but if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps .
zoom in on haiti , in outline here .
it plots income , average income in china as a percentage of average income in the united states .
two : operate on the right scale .
we start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we 'll need to build the city .
and we can scale this model .
so if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again , we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world .
`` others will hold back . but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . '' '' now , where else might this model be tried ? ''
perhaps even in some arrangement that 's a little bit like an escrow account , where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it .
this is a picture i took when i was flying along the coast .
now , if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites , but dozens — cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions , perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century — is there enough land for them ?
perhaps brazil comes in as a participant , and spain as well . and perhaps cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture .
how would we write the treaty to do that ?
turns out singapore and hong kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started .
when we think about ideas in that way , we usually think about technologies .
yet he can still be influenced by a principal who had opened up a school that believes in all children .
this resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised for our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities , summer steam programs , as well as college scholarships .
and there are high demands within an education system that is not perfect .
and i give them access to me every single day , which is why they all have my personal cell number , including my scholars and those who graduated — which is probably why i get phone calls and text messages at three o'clock in the morning .
( laughter ) but we are all connected to succeed , and good leaders do this .
`` there 's a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards , who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately , while at the same time saying to herself over and over again , `` do n't smile till november , '' because that 's what she was taught in her teacher education program . ''
magic can be taught . magic can be taught .
if you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education , you 've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood .
and if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof ! we could make dead classes come alive , we could reignite imaginations , and we can change education .
( applause )
we intuit other people 's feelings ; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
it happens to some of our phyletic cousins , because if you 're a monkey , and you look at another monkey , and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you , and that is considered to be a signal or threat , well , you are not going to be alive for long .
how do we enter that feeling of resonance , how do we enter another person 's being ?
`` and then he said , `` '' what you do for the least of these , you do for me . '' '' now i was pretty psyched . ''
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said , and i 'm paraphrasing , the poor would always be with us .
and i felt overwhelmed .
so i spent three months in kenya , uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
the second year , it was a total of 15 million .
but instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward .
imagine if you could hear a story you did n't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very , very hard to make their life better .
when you lend them money , and they slowly pay you back over time , you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .
this continued attention — this ongoing attention — is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .
as i 've researched what 's going on in the united states , a few interesting little insights have come up .
we make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
as investors choose to become involved based on those terms , they can either take their rewards back as cash , or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit .
right now , profounder 's right at the very beginning , and it 's very palpable ; it 's very clear to me , that it 's just a vessel , it 's just a tool .
and i think i can remind us that we do care .
i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant or that it 's bad for polar bears or forests , though it certainly is .
but that 's not possible , you might think .
we ca n't stop economic growth .
and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes .
there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
it 's like the earth does n't care what we need .
mother nature does n't negotiate ; she just sets rules and describes consequences .
this is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
if it 's that bad , we 'll react .
let 's just think through that idea .
i actually do n't say this in despair .
but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we 're not acting , we 're not close to acting and we 're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy .
and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for .
i know most people do n't see it that way .
we see the occupy protests , we see spiraling debt crises , we see growing inequality , we see money 's influence on politics , we see resource constraint , food and oil prices .
this issue is , how will we react ?
after the bombing of pearl harbor , it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry , and from there to rationing of food and energy .
we did n't calculate that precisely , but we understand that 's very expensive .
they 're wrong .
( applause )
but we have n't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we 're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us — that , i do n't know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
you can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane .
so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible .
we 've gone from being three of us working in the basement at mit while we were still in graduate school to about two-dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of boston .
and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas .
door-to-door travel time is reduced , because now , instead of lugging bags , finding a parking space , taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger , you 're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go .
how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value , instead of just being chaos ?
tagging was pioneered by delicious and joshua schachter .
tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification .
it 's mathematically true , but it does n't really talk about anything important — because in these systems , the average is n't really what matters .
what matters is this .
whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule , this is what 's going on . right ?
institutions only have two tools : carrots and sticks .
do n't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people .
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n .
right ? how do you capture that ?
and so the shield law , as much as we want it — we want a professional class of truth-tellers — it is becoming increasingly incoherent , because the institution is becoming incoherent .
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots , trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists .
and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism , it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .
so as much as we want the shield laws , the background — the institution to which they were attached — is becoming incoherent .
thank you very much .
`` so i 've been thinking about that problem , and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named joseph soloveitchik , who was a rabbi who wrote a book called `` '' the lonely man of faith '' '' in 1965 . ''
adam ii wants not only to do good but to be good , to live in a way internally that honors god , creation and our possibilities .
adam i wants to conquer the world .
adam ii wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
we live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value .
i was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid adam ii , how you build a depth of character .
and we 're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves , in that we 're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it , how to confront it , and how to combat it .
no virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint .
( applause )
over the past 10 years , i 've been researching the way people organize and visualize information .
and i 've noticed an interesting shift .
but over time , interestingly enough , this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the porphyrian tree , also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge .
emma mcnally is one of the main leaders of this movement , and she creates these striking , imaginary landscapes , where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization .
as you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes , the entire network kind of shifts , almost like a real organic network would .
`` because as bruce mau once said , `` '' when everything is connected to everything else , for better or for worse , everything matters . '' '' thank you so much . ''
you ca n't even manufacture it through milling .
`` now , we were inspired by the `` '' terminator 2 '' '' scene for t-1000 , and we thought , why could n't a 3d printer operate in this fashion , where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object ? ''
okay , just like the movies .
light and oxygen work in different ways .
so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view , and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen , we could control this process .
but with our very special window , what we 're able to do is , with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it , that oxygen inhibits the reaction , and we form a dead zone .
the result is pretty staggering .
you have molecularly smooth surfaces .
and look at the structures that my students are making at the university of north carolina .
we 're really good at that , but it 's actually very hard to make things from 10 microns to 1,000 microns , the mesoscale .
so the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up 3d manufacturing , and for us , this is very exciting , because this really is owning the intersection between hardware , software and molecular science , and i ca n't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool .
but it 's very simple . it 's very simplistic .
the protocell moves . it encounters the food .
now , this does n't have a brain , it does n't have a neural system . this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior .
if we count the number of chemicals in that system , actually , including the water that 's in the dish , we have five chemicals that can do this .
we 're going to make two different kinds .
protocell a has a certain kind of chemistry inside that , when activated , the protocell starts to vibrate around , just dancing .
now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event . right . ( laughter ) just with blobs of chemicals , again .
so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they 're very easy to make , and they have interesting lifelike properties , perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
if you let that go unregulated , you 'll continue to make and break chemical bonds , forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan , right , that 's difficult to wash out . so that 's what the origin of life would have looked like .
but again , these are done in these primordial conditions , really messy conditions , not sort of sterile laboratory conditions .
this is similar to having the sun shining on the earth , driving photosynthesis , driving the ecosystem .
we were officially empty nesters , and we decided , let 's go on a family vacation .
i 'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of als .
thus my mission had begun .
pete was put on a compassionate use drug .
i 'm telling you , it 's one of the best ones , and that was probably in day two .
so we knew awareness would lead to funding , we just did n't know it would only take a couple of days .
so we got together , put our best 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) s on pete 's website , and off we went .
j.t. , justin timberlake .
incredible .
it was on a three-year track for funding .
no , i do n't think anybody would blame me , but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive .
i 'm going to save my son , and if it does n't happen in time for him , i 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what i 'm going through .
now , 60 years later , i 'm here to tell you why it 's possible .
at the end of my first year in school , in the summer of that year , i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home .
so for once , perhaps , the government is ahead of itself .
`` the press calls my particular volantor a `` '' skycar . '' '' this is a little bit earlier version of it , that 's why it 's given the x designation , but it 's a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically , like a helicopter — therefore it does n't need an airfield . ''
when you get in the skycar — and i can tell you , there 's only one other person that 's flown it , but he had the same sensation — you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet , without any vibration whatsoever . the sensation is unbelievable .
or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system .
and we had very small power plants in it at this time .
we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
if you can live 75 miles from san francisco and get there in 15 minutes , you 're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment , buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain , buy a skycar , which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars , put money in the bank ...
`` twenty-three percent said , `` '' yes , as soon as possible . '' '' forty-seven percent — yes , as soon as they could — price could come down . ''
i 'm encouraged by that . at least it makes me feel like , to some extent , it is becoming self-evident .
perhaps you 've thought some of these things .
and our choices indeed are often terrible .
but in any year , you can look up and down the ballot and find plenty to be uninspired about .
and while it 's nice to share political memes on social media , that 's a rather quiet kind of citizenship .
let me tell you about a couple of them .
i used to be afraid of ghosts .
it 's just a wall .
why bother ?
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
overnight , the policy priorities of this country change dramatically , and every level of government becomes radically more responsive to all the people .
i love trees , and i 'm very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arboretum , and sundays , usually , i 'd go there with my wife and now , with my four-year-old , and we 'd climb in the trees , we 'd play hide and seek .
and we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and , in fact , i will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns , and i 'm afraid it 's a story from uganda , and , although we had a wonderful story from uganda yesterday , this one is n't quite so good .
still exists back home .
but later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
i had a driver on my way to newark airport , and he told me a story that , in the middle of the night , 4 a.m. , he 'd been taken out of his home in queens — taken to a place in the midwest , that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later , because he had the same — he was middle eastern , and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots , and that may or may not be true — i did n't think he was a liar , though .
anyway , witness has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world , with cameras , and i 'd like to show you just a little more of that . thank you .
the impact was great .
i am an undercover journalist .
my kind of journalism is a product of my society .
so with my hidden intention , i kept quiet .
the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled .
i thought that i could n't come here without giving you something special .
i have been undercover in the prisons .
now , i happen to have followed one of my inmates , one of my friends , from his sick bed till death , and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all .
you see , we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions .
so yes , when the backup systems are put in place , i 'm okay , i go in . risky , yes , but it 's a hazard of a profession .
ca : well , you 're an amazing human and you 've done amazing work and you 've taught us a story like no story i think any of us have heard before .
and i have n't the slightest idea of what it does or what it 's good for , but i want it .
and that 's my new life .
there was this wonderful review in the new york times about the mini cooper automobile .
`` you bring in a second group of people , and you say , `` '' oh , before we start , i got this box of candy , and i do n't eat candy . ''
the middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that 's actually where most of our stuff gets done .
( laughter ) or this — this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago .
the water then seeps over the tea .
it 's being safe in the world .
if you want a more positive model — this is the gm car .
`` or an expensive watch , so you can impress people — `` oh gee , i did n't know you had that watch . '' ''
life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade .
africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now .
i 'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world , and the blue line is the one i want you to focus on for a second .
if you look at the red line here , what you 're going to see is that in 1975 , just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-saharan africa .
nobody else did .
fragile democracies is the beige color .
and what you 'll see here is that most africans are now living in democracies .
the other guy had to say , i 'm going to build 50 new schools .
it 's a positive , virtuous circle .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
you see the middle class grow .
now , i do n't want to be an apologist for corruption .
i 've been arrested because i refused to pay a bribe — not in africa , actually .
`` and if you go back to the year 2000 , what you 'll find is the economist had a very famous cover , `` '' the hopeless continent , '' '' and what they 'd done is they 'd looked at growth in africa over the previous 10 years — two percent — and they said , what 's going to happen in the next 10 years ? ''
people got poorer in africa in the 1990s .
that new cover shows , well , africa rising , because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent .
no offense .
perhaps africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made .
surely , the technologies that we 're talking about here this last week , surely some of these can perhaps help africa grow even faster ?
my ipod 's full of them .
go on holiday and see for yourself the change that 's happening .
( music ) jose antonio abreu : my dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , i am overjoyed today at being awarded the ted prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in venezuela the national system of youth and children 's orchestras and choirs .
from that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country .
from the very first rehearsal , i saw the bright future ahead .
ja : during the recent tour by the simon bolivar youth orchestra of venezuela of u.s. and europe , we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls , how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians , how the standing ovations , sometimes 30 minutes long , seemed to last forever , and how the public , after the concert was over , went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph .
music is life .
we have another well-known case — gustavo dudamel .
he was the conductor of the gothenburg symphony orchestra , and he 's an unbeatable example for young musicians in latin america and the world .
so , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge — the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
all this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence .
mother teresa of calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me : the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof , but the feeling of being no-one — the feeling of not being anyone , the lack of identification , the lack of public esteem .
it 's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home , while her mother does the housework .
we hope that ted can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music , in which the social , communal , spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission .
( music ) ( applause ) ca : we are going live now to caracas .
thank you very much .
it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity .
and at the intersection of these four fields , my team and i create .
we printed its surface out of 44 different properties , varying in rigidity , opacity and color , corresponding to pressure points on the human body .
its surface , as in nature , varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly , but by continuously and delicately varying material property .
for the first time , we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh , and if scaled even larger , to windows .
the setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system .
i like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy , only instead of transmuting precious metals , you 're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels .
and the second , e. coli , the bacterium that inhabits the human gut .
( applause ) thank you .
what if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins , repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies ?
we knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas , so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure .
bucky fuller said that tension is the great integrity , and he was right .
which brings us back , of course , to the beginning .
many of you might be familiar with taz , the cartoon character , the one that spins around and around and around .
so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas ' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body .
in fact , more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil — and jonas was clearly a male .
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas ' face ?
he 's a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya .
last year , his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region .
and this is a photograph of dr. southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer , who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary .
in fact , i believe , given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer 's growth , we can defeat cancer .
( applause )
and we used to imagine that someday , they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin , and , if they could , they would fly away .
and the open grassland savannas of north america opened up , leading to the columbian mammoth , a large , hairless species in north america .
so large , hairless columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies .
now , when i bring up this with my friends , we often talk about , well , where would you put it ?
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it — the world around us and the world inside us .
`` and i said , `` '' so what were you doing ? '' '' and he said , `` '' well we were mostly breaking stealth . '' '' and i said , `` '' that 's a good job . that 's interesting . ''
so we did n't use a radar ; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals , electronic communication .
so you 've effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research .
( laughter ) if you had bought it at 1.7 , it would have been a bargain .
so one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies .
and the thing is , is that this is n't google .
and if these algorithms , like the algorithms on wall street , just crashed one day and went awry , how would we know ?
these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means .
so none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .
so let me take it back to wall street .
these guys down on wall street , marco polo and cherokee nation , they 're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the carrier hotel .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
this is just theoretical .
it involves light cones and quantum entanglement , and i do n't really understand any of that .
and in that light , you go back and you look at michael najjar 's photographs , and you realize that they 're not metaphor , they 're prophecy .
and that 's great .
and these intermediaries perform all the business and transaction logic of every kind of commerce , from authentication , identification of people , through to clearing , settling and record keeping .
they exclude billions of people from the global economy , for example , people who do n't have enough money to have a bank account .
they capture our data , and that means we ca n't monetize it or use it to better manage our lives .
our privacy is being undermined .
so what if there were not only an internet of information , what if there were an internet of value — some kind of vast , global , distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody .
what if there were a native medium for value ?
more broadly , it 's a cryptocurrency .
but the real pony here is the underlying technology .
fair enough .
they have massive computing power at their fingertips — 10 to 100 times bigger than all of google worldwide .
i mean , you tap your card in the corner store , and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies , each with their own computer system , some of them being 1970s mainframes older than many of the people in this room , and three days later , a settlement occurs .
this creates the conditions for prosperity for potentially billions of people .
secondly : a lot of writers talk about uber and airbnb and taskrabbit and lyft and so on as part of the sharing economy .
these companies are not really sharing .
she lives in toronto , and every month she goes to the western union office with some cash to send her remittances to her mom in manila .
this is a big opportunity for prosperity .
it only gives away the shred of information that 's required to do something .
and then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data and enabling you to monetize it .
finally — ( applause ) finally , number five : there are a whole number of creators of content who do n't receive fair compensation , because the system for intellectual property is broken .
she describes that the song becomes a business .
it 's out there on this platform marketing itself , protecting the rights of the author , and because the song has a payment system in the sense of bank account , all the money flows back to the artist , and they control the industry , rather than these powerful intermediaries .
but my case to you is that , once again , the technology genie has escaped from the bottle , and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons at this uncertain time in human history , and it 's giving us another kick at the can , another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things , and solve some of the world 's most difficult problems , if we will it .
( applause )
i was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation , which is what drove me then , and still , it 's a delusion that drives me now .
it 's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university , except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns , and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health , as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals .
number one was asthma , number two was developmental delays , number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10 , 15 years .
i like this one from the belgian field office , where we met in a roundabout , precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation , as opposed to the top-down control of red light traffic intersections .
but , of course , affords greater throughput , fewer accidents , and an interesting model of social movement .
and of course , these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic , the obesity epidemic , the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things .
anyone here lucky enough to share , to cohabit with a mouse — a domestic partnership with mice ?
they 're even better models of environmental health , because not only the same mammalian biology , but they share your diet , largely .
so do you think the mice self-administered antidepressants ?
this was vodka and solution , gin and solution .
so i want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the no park .
what is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis ?
you understand a solar chimney .
hot air rises .
when we put it through our solar chimney , we remove actually about 95 percent of that .
and we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we 've pulled out of the air .
here 's one of them that we have up now .
okay , so i want to show you just two more interfaces , because i think one of our big challenges is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems , not only through this model of twisted personalized health , but through the animals with whom we cohabit .
this is communication technology for birds . it looks like this .
they said things like this .
it looks like this : buoys that float on the water , project three foot up , three foot down .
you can subscribe to updates from him . you can talk to him .
in this case , instead of throwing chewing gum , or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish — there 's a body of water in iceland that i 've been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution , it 's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues .
i should tell you our story .
in fact , we are thriving , and the reason we are thriving is because we 've been blessed with extraordinary kings .
`` we call this holistic approach to development `` '' gross national happiness , '' '' or gnh . ''
our entire gdp is less than two billion dollars .
our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent of bhutan 's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time .
( applause ) fact is , we already have a king in retirement : our previous king , the great fourth , retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity .
and if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential , and that 's exactly what we are working at , the clean , green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year .
so inside our country , we are a net carbon sink .
it 's stunning .
a few years ago , a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below .
we will fight climate change .
nobody cared .
all countries , from the very small to the very large , committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions .
it 's crucial that all of us keep our commitments .
we are providing free electricity to our rural farmers .
but the beauty is that we 've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors .
( applause ) we must keep it that way .
so in closing , i 'd like to share one more dream that i have .
( applause ) thank you , thank you , thank you .
we 're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .
we start from doodles and sketches .
and sometimes we just start building .
and the things that they build amaze even themselves .
gever tulley : a rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .
and it got me wondering : if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis , could you reverse engineer a tedtalk ?
to find this out , i looked at three things : i looked at the topic that you should choose , i looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage .
i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite tedtalks as opposed to the least favorite tedtalks .
secondly , it 's imperative that you do not cite the new york times .
and i call this tool the tedpad .
you only have to make one decision , and that is : are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks , about creativity , human genius ?
during my visit i 've been especially honored to meet some of britain 's most extraordinary women — women who are paving the way for all of you .
there is nothing in my story that would land me here .
i am an example of what 's possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them .
and my mother , the most important role model in my life , who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters , malia and sasha .
they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family .
he worked , helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods .
as he talked to the residents in that community center , he talked about two concepts .
what he said , that all too often , is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .
but barack reminded us on that day , all of us in that room , that we all know what our world should look like .
and he urged the people in that meeting , in that community , to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas , to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be , one and the same .
because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women .
the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society .
`` and this school , named after the u.k. 's first female doctor , and the surrounding buildings named for mexican artist frida kahlo , mary seacole , the jamaican nurse known as the `` '' black florence nightingale , '' '' and the english author , emily bronte , honor women who fought sexism , racism and ignorance , to pursue their passions to feed their own souls . ''
and they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors , all of whom have followed them .
i never cut class . sorry , i do n't know if anybody is cutting class .
i thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
and it wo n't be easy — that 's for sure .
but that ability to make progress remained almost unused , until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe .
but i 'll have to backtrack a little first .
but that ca n't be what made the difference .
what 's wrong with us ?
we do n't see those nuclear reactions in stars .
how ?
`` yours comes from guesswork , ours from the bible . '' '' but what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that , in that sense , no one has ever seen a bible either , that the eye only detects light , which we do n't perceive . ''
brains only detect nerve impulses .
hades , god of the underworld , kidnaps persephone , the goddess of spring , and negotiates a forced marriage contract , requiring her to return regularly , and lets her go .
so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest , they 'd have known that their theory is false .
there is such a thing as a defect in a story .
she escaped , and returns every spring to take revenge on hades , with her spring powers .
if the axis-tilt theory had been refuted , its defenders would have had nowhere to go .
( applause )
it does n't come out particularly well , but that 's a particularly tall bicycle .
and it 's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation .
we got there first .
`` no , i did n't get wet . am i going to get wet ? am i going to get wet ? '' '' that 's the experience of a clever ride . ''
you know what those are , right ?
now the background is — the guy who did this is a physicist .
you 're really a driver or a passenger — to use a volkswagen phrase .
they 're a bit subversive in what they do .
with our strengths and our minds and spirit , we gather , we form , and we fashion .
makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers .
we made it , and we were connected to it that way .
and when i sat down next to him , he was telling me about a company he formed , and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .
now the other thing that i think is taking off , another reason making is taking off today , is there 's some great new tools out there .
there 's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that .
but it 's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries — even like henry ford — come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
things just ca n't possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were synergistic .
and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
so now we 've speeded up the time scales once again .
and i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
`` say , `` '' please repeat that process . '' '' score them again . ''
introduce some mutations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
they 're obscure , weird programs .
so it 's feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing .
and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms .
we 're right at that point of transition .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
( applause )
there may be setbacks to our society — indeed , a 50 percent chance of a severe setback .
that 's where you 're pulling imagery together and getting 3d reconstruction .
and not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage , it 's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of washington state .
it was so hot , on one of the robots , the tracks began to melt and come off .
they assist the responders , the experts , in new and innovative ways .
it 's not making more sensors .
what are the odds that the experts , your chemical engineer , your railroad transportation engineers , have been trained on whatever uav that particular county happens to have ?
probably , like , none .
so we need to think about those kinds of challenges .
it 's not about the robots .
look for the robots , because robots are coming to the rescue .
fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we do n't recall what was there .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
`` for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area can not be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it 's not `` '' scientific . '' '' so you have a situation where people do n't know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they do n't trust the sources of the past . ''
`` and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like `` '' avatar . '' '' ( laughter ) and if you think about `` '' avatar , '' '' if you think of why people were so touched by it — never mind the pocahontas story — why so touched by the imagery ? ''
( applause )
there 's six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
in fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers .
and so i looked up what the economy was paying for the war in iraq in the same year .
small animals eat insects .
there 's quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
( laughter ) in fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
in a lot of food items that we have — i have only two items here on the slide — pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , campari — a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .
and we eat quite a lot of it .
but it 's increasing enormously .
they have the same share that we have .
we could do with much , much less — and i know , i 've been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
you 'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
they 're even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak .
we 're not taking the bonus yet .
and then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority — in a country like the u.k. , the usa , the netherlands , anywhere .
on the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
that 's why we 're changing the perception of insects .
( music ) ( applause ) so there 's even a lot of design to it .
investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call esg : environment , social and governance .
and governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors .
see , i told you this is the really juicy stuff .
so how are companies actually leveraging esg to drive hard business results ?
in 2012 , state street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment , and we retired another 85 .
another example is pentair .
so that 's okay , right ? we want more . i want more .
calpers is another example .
`` in their own words , `` '' long-term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital : financial , human , and physical . ''
`` this is why we are concerned with esg . '' '' now , i do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job , and not all of them see it this way . ''
i mean , let me clarify something right here .
so we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges , like fresh water , clean air , feeding 10 billion mouths , if institutional investors integrated esg into investment .
my name is meher and this is my friend irim .
and i 'm an idp , an internally displaced person , from swat .
do you see me on the other side of this fence ?
and that is why i want to illuminate the world .
my name is papusay .
`` our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means `` '' new life '' '' in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care . ''
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
i found that really moving .
that 's what i want to talk to you about tonight — how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator .
so let 's see what it looks like .
so this is gallbladder surgery .
it 's hard to teach , and it 's not all that easy to learn .
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
`` all right , you 've all heard the term : `` he 's a born surgeon . '' ''
let me tell you , surgeons are not born .
surgeons are trained one step at a time .
it starts with a foundation , basic skills .
and i think that we can develop some tools to do so .
so here 's allan teaching an english-speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
even people who say they speak english , only 14 percent pass .
it 's a big labor-intensive effort .
it 's a big task .
that 's a tall order . we have to work at it .
this is research — ca n't buy it .
we 're working with the folks at ibm research from the accessibility center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator .
but we do n't have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
narrator : fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
but if you happen to be sitting in beijing at the same time , by using technology in a constructive fashion , you could get it in mandarin or you could get it in russian — on and on and on , simultaneously without the use of human translators .
the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much .
we want it to be bi-directional .
this is a ubiquitous tool .
i 'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view .
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
i can extract information from these .
if i take a log book , i can consider , it 's not just a log book of a venetian captain going to a particular journey .
i can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period .
if i have a painting of a facade , i can consider it 's not just that particular building , but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information .
this is a domain of something that seems impossible , which can actually be done , simply by putting additional constraints .
and these are administrative documents .
if we reach that stage , then there 's something else : we can extract from this document events .
so the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the european level .
how can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
maybe there 's not a single map .
again , venice is extraordinary for that .
so to conclude , we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago .
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
now i 'm thinking of myself at eight , i concede , but i 'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news .
but what do we do ? we ca n't go the tom ripley route .
the next minute they 're on the same side .
we could align ourselves with it .
we are in excellent company .
thank you .
i want to talk about penguins today .
it 's the same problems in the galapagos , except , obviously , it 's worse here , in some ways , than other places .
but moreover , i 'd never lived on an uninhabited island .
but scientifically , they 're amazing because they 're sentinels .
they tell us about our world in a lot of different ways , and particularly the ocean .
things die when there 's no food .
i studied marine iguanas at that point .
this is a picture at punta tombo in february showing all the penguins along the beach .
i went there because the japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves , protein and oil .
and science is important in informing decision makers , and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in .
because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point , so when they 're empty , they have the ballast water in there .
so now i want to show you that penguins are affected .
and what the penguins show us — and these are all the little dots from where the penguins ' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 — and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs , the other one is out there foraging , and the longer they have to stay gone , the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back .
this past year , in 2009 , you can see that they 're now raising about a fourth of a chick , and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests .
and some of you consider them almost part of your family .
turbo 's never been fed .
and penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another .
look how fat he is . he 's walking back to feed his chicks .
it 's been around for about 7,000 years .
so when these neurons are in the motor circuit , you get dysfunction in the movement system , and you get things like parkinson 's disease .
and this is accomplished using this kind of device , and this is called deep brain stimulation .
the electrodes are turned off now , and you can see that she has tremor .
it 's on . just turned it on .
so in this case , we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons .
we started using this technique in other problems , and i 'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered , a case of dystonia .
five of them have dystonia .
he was crippled , and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted , progressively disabled , and many of these children do not survive .
he did not respond to any drugs .
this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life .
they shut down . they turn off .
can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again ?
we can turn them down if they are overactive , if they 're causing trouble , trouble that is felt throughout the brain , or we can turn them up if they are underperforming , and in so doing , we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain .
the implications of this , of course , is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease , but i have n't told you but there 's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity , and this is something for the future , to see if , indeed , we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested .
one of the most exciting things about this is that , indeed , it involves multidisciplinary work .
and i mention this because , if we want to design for that future , we need to figure out what those people are about .
if you think of everything in your life that you own , when you walk out that door , what do you consider to take with you ?
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
and a mobile phone , it turns out , is a great recovery tool .
yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they 're very good at this .
and you can do them with phone kiosks .
and pretty much everyone does it at some point .
and in fact , when you 're turning around , and you 're looking inside the house , and you 're looking for this stuff , this is where you look first , right ?
ok , so when we did this research , we found the absolutely , 100 percent , guaranteed way to never forget anything ever , ever again .
and that is , quite simply , to have nothing to remember .
( laughter ) ok , now , that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie , right ?
so , we 've been conducting a lot of research .
and one of the things we were looking at is — if you ca n't read and write , if you want to communicate over distances , you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with .
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation .
let me give you another example of delegation .
so the first is , it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone — anyone who has a mobile phone — essentially into an atm machine .
and i look at something like this and it makes me question , if we were to take all the functionality in things like this , and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network , how would we prioritize where to put stuff ?
and yes , this is quite trivial , but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks .
and then i go to this picture here , which is the one that i started with .
you can see the chai being poured in the background .
and it 's not necessarily the same values , but some kind of values of livestrong , to actually go out and purchase them , and actually display them .
in ways that , despite our resources , they can do it better than us .
and if we 're smart , we 'll look at this stuff that 's going on , and we 'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design .
so thank you very , very much .
( applause )
now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective .
now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that , our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal . now working memory capacity
you up for that ? okay .
five words .
some will be down to two or three .
it 's limited in capacity , limited in duration , limited in focus .
you do know the solution to that , right ?
we negotiate that through strategies .
so we need to think about , well , do i agree with him ?
the next thing is , we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively .
if you read a book , pull things up .
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
live life . thank you .
( applause )
we 're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box , and we ca n't push it back in .
( laughter ) susan blackmore : someone says no , very loudly , from over there .
there 's one word i love on that slide .
sb : no , not without .
if there 's something that is copied with variation and it 's selected , then you must get design appearing out of nowhere .
darwin did n't , of course ; he did n't know about genes .
information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things .
`` so , he took the greek word `` '' mimeme , '' '' which means that which is imitated . ''
remember that , that 's the core definition : that which is imitated .
well , you sir , you 've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way .
if you copied it from someone else , it 's a meme .
and what about , oh , i ca n't see any interesting memes here .
there are plenty more in the shops .
you go to your nice , posh , international hotel somewhere , and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom , and what do you see ?
this has spread all over the world .
other people are just lazy and make mistakes .
some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker .
and you know , actually , all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place .
the memes are all trying to get copied — trying , in inverted commas — i.e. , that 's the shorthand for , if they can get copied , they will .
now , why is this important ?
why is this useful , or what does it tell us ?
all other theories explaining the big brain , and language , and tool use and all these things that make us unique , are based upon genes .
because the processes are getting different .
we began , perhaps 5,000 years ago , with writing .
and we 're getting there .
people have been asking this question for a long time .
in 1961 , frank drake made his famous equation , but i think he concentrated on the wrong things .
human intelligence is only one kind of a thing .
the fraction of those that get the second replicator .
i loved peter ward 's talk yesterday — it 's not gaian all the time .
but then , a long time later , billions of years later , we got the second replicator , the memes .
( laughter ) my cat gave birth to four kittens , purring all the time .
but maybe it nearly did .
because we are self-replicating .
so , those are the two possibilities .
the second , i do n't think we 're that close .
it 's coming , but we 're not there yet .
ca : ( laughter )
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv/aids .
so this became one of the driving passions of my life , to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems .
so , with one microfluidic chip , which is the size of an iphone , you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time .
`` the only external commands are high-level ones such as `` '' take off '' '' and `` '' land . '' '' this is a so-called tail-sitter . ''
unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft , however , it is capable of hovering , which has huge advantages for takeoff , landing and general versatility .
when doing research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter .
it turns out that decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a propeller and a tail rudder .
it has its own complexities , mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers .
we 're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves .
thank you .
one word of profanity , and you are out of here for the day .
why not just take someone like keith wilkes and let it go at that .
`` you know , it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation , we just had to follow the advice of henry higgins in `` '' my fair lady '' '' : stick to the weather and your health . ''
`` and he said this : `` '' i came to realize ... '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach . ''
( laughter ) now , there 's a really good reason why i do n't allow pundits on my show : because they 're really boring .
because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it , and you 're going to get a much more interesting response .
number five : if you do n't know , say that you do n't know .
`` somebody asked stephen hawking once what his iq was , and he said , `` i have no idea . people who brag about their iqs are losers . '' ''
especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids , we have a point to make , so we just keep rephrasing it over and over .
i can bolster my own identity .
you 're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place .
`` he said , `` '' most of us do n't listen with the intent to understand . ''
`` she won a pulitzer prize . he 's a russian ballet dancer . '' '' and i kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden , amazing thing about them . ''
what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
the three of us take this class together .
guys , we have an issue .
this creates tensions and serious conflicts .
this means either more labor or more capital or more productivity .
but it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain .
this is the fourth manufacturing revolution , and it 's happening right now .
major technologies are entering the manufacturing space , big time .
today in our factories , only 8 percent of the tasks are automated .
it will be 25 percent in 10 years .
aerospace companies are now using 3d printing , which allows them to turn those 20 different parts into just one .
we are now able to produce a batch of one product , your product , at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many .
then , our factories will be smaller , agile .
the change will be drastic .
only the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth .
it 's also a chance for developing economies .
last year , it was already as expensive to produce in brazil as to produce in france .
thank you .
and i think that is , well , stupid .
( laughter ) another way that you can make words in english is kind of like compounding , but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off .
so it does n't matter how silly the words are .
i 'm an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
so here 's a food web , or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you did n't think of before .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park .
instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated .
and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government .
the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence — popular support for the government .
and so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence .
i do n't know about this , but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds .
this is quite comforting for people like me — i 'm a professor — this to be over there on the top of creation .
but it 's also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ; they are able to sense .
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
`` now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle , that in `` '' de anima '' '' — that is a very influential book for the western civilization — wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living . ''
it 's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
and it 's really so graceful ; it 's like a dancing angel .
they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination .
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance — very energizing — having in change this transportation of the pollen .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
they work in the same way .
they are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
they work in the same way .
you can remove 90 percent of the internet and it is [ continuing ] to work .
we have the androids that are inspired by man .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
maybe it 's because my native state of south carolina , which is not much smaller than present-day hungary , once imagined a future for itself as an independent country .
`` so , `` '' jó napot , pacák ! '' '' i went back to south carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the 1960s , with the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people . ''
he had been born in 1903 in the provinces of the old austro-hungarian empire , in what later would become yugoslavia .
they were to be his seed group , his future foremen .
he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions .
to me , it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe .
wise he was , indeed , but he also had a wonderful sense of humor .
`` `` learn as if you 'll live forever . '' ''
phyllis rodriguez : we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
( translator ) aicha el-wafi : good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
i go to schools to talk to young , muslim girls so they do n't accept to be married against their will very young .
so if i can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did , well this is something good .
`` `` why does she want to meet us ? '' ''
`` and aicha started , and she said , `` '' i do n't know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families . ''
`` who else can i meet that i do n't know , or that i 'm so different from ? '' '' so , aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ? ''
i 'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science , one that is still speculative but hugely exciting , and certainly one that 's growing very rapidly .
i 've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics .
but it means i study the very smallest structures in the universe — the building blocks of reality .
it 's a world of phantoms , where particles can also behave like spread-out waves .
quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial — the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics — and to see if they do , indeed , play an important role in describing the processes of life .
physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness .
it influenced francis crick and james watson , the discoverers of the double-helix structure of dna .
i want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones .
this is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world , quantum tunneling .
the box on the left shows the wavelike , spread-out distribution of a quantum entity — a particle , like an electron , which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall .
back in the 70s and 80s , it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells .
enzymes help this take place .
`` and in spanish , `` '' zanfona . '' '' and in italian , `` '' ghironda , '' '' okay ? ''
it has three different kinds of strings .
so all of this is pretty innovative , if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it ; one to turn the crank , and another person — yes — to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs .
( music ) thank you . thank you .
what is real is separateness , and at some point in early babyhood , the idea of self starts to form .
my dad is white from cornwall , and my mom is black from zimbabwe .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i did n't fit .
i 'd literally lose myself .
i would put all my emotional expression into my dancing .
and at 16 , i stumbled across another opportunity , and i earned my first acting role in a film .
i applied to read anthropology at university .
and of course i did .
it happens when i dance , when i 'm acting .
but i 'm not ashamed of my self .
in fact , i respect my self and its function .
and over time and with practice , i 've tried to live more and more from my essence .
we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other — billions of each other .
only we 're not living with each other ; our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection .
we knew it from the day we were born .
simple awareness is where it begins .
at the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology .
no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo 10 , and blithe optimism about technology 's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to mars , creating clean energy , curing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard .
i remember watching the liftoff of apollo 17 .
there 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
what happened ?
silicon valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs .
but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
but 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution .
and arguably it was n't even solving much of a problem .
can you get me some information ?
all this noise around us actually has information .
we extracted the key bits on information to build the database .
and once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff .
and on the vertical axis you 've got the number of attacks .
we looked at colombia , we looked at afghanistan , and we looked at senegal .
this was n't supposed to happen .
so we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
and if you do n't find that solution as an insurgent force , you do n't exist .
we 've got to change that .
and depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
and this tells me one of two things .
either we 're back where we started and the surge has had no effect ; or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out .
but i know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question .
( applause ) writing is not actually as easy as that for me .
all afternoon they face one another , the man in the brown suit , the woman in the blue dress — perfectly motionless , perfectly behaved .
and even now , as you memorize the order of the planets , something else is slipping away , a state flower perhaps , the address of an uncle , the capital of paraguay .
whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen .
( applause ) bc : thank you . ( applause )
( applause ) bc : i 'm not sure if other poems will be animated .
( laughter ) i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only 15 .
they are self-aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
today , 10 percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events .
this results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year , not to mention the impact on all of us : stress , inconvenience , missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal .
so how can the industrial internet help here ?
the aircraft , while in flight , will communicate with technicians on the ground .
just in the u.s. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year , helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time .
that seems trivial , but it 's less time spent caring for patients .
if all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken , they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster .
this new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work .
they 've raised living standards .
the economic challenges facing us are hard , but when i walk the factory floor , and i see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected , and i see the difference this makes in a hospital , in an airport , in a power generation plant , i 'm not just optimistic , i 'm enthusiastic .
thank you .
the political fight that we 've developed has become one around whether it 's the government that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem .
and the answer is yes and no ; it 's deeper than all of that .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
and he wrote this book to explain , among other things , what it was like to be a medical intern at the boston city hospital in the pre-penicillin year of 1937 .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
well , we 've now discovered 4,000 medical and surgical procedures .
and in the year 1970 , it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians .
60 percent of our asthma , stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
`` we want to say , `` '' this is just the way it is . ''
that is to say , they found ways to get all of the different pieces , all of the different components , to come together into a whole .
having great components is not enough , and yet we 've been obsessed in medicine with components .
there 's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said , what if you built a car from the very best car parts ?
it 's not a system .
when you are a specialist , you ca n't see the end result very well .
he did n't see it in his own patients .
i got interested in this when the world health organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery .
well in surgery , you could n't have people who are more specialized and you could n't have people who are better trained .
you have to think about things like pause points .
it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
the live duck mounted the dead duck , and started to copulate .
well , i 'm a biologist . i 'm an ornithologist .
so i — ( laughter ) i took my camera , i took my notebook , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
it 's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds and only 300 possess a penis .
`` i got a phone call from a person called marc abrahams , and he told me , `` '' you 've won a prize with your duck paper : the ig nobel prize . '' '' and the ig nobel prize — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the ig nobel prize honors research that first makes people laugh , and then makes them think , with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science . ''
after winning this prize , my life changed .
this is in montana , 2008 .
this is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish .
this is a turkey in wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution .
so what does this mean ?
i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ?
in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings .
thank you .
anatomy was caught in a struggle between science , art and culture that lasted for over 500 years .
and some illustrations even included pop culture references .
including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today .
as a tribute to her trauma , she commissioned montreal-based architect federico carbajal to construct a wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg .
but if you look closely , you 'll notice that it lacks a brain .
then there are artists who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world and are placing it directly on the streets .
street artists believe that art belongs to the public .
so there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work , i think , in many areas of human problem solving , particularly those which involve human psychology , which is : the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible , as much compulsion as possible , whereas actually , the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied .
it 's a tiny , tiny thing .
actually , what happens in the world increasingly — now , all credit to the british airport authority .
it wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate .
thank you very much .
i was thrilled to get it . i was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet .
and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
so , what do we architects need to do ? we need to stitch back creation and execution .
but i 'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pedantic statements .
the first is : take core positions with your client .
i know it 's shocking , right , that architecture would actually say that .
the second position is : actually take positions .
now , the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of new york , chicago and seattle .
but it also had to do with something rather unusual , and that was this horrible little building that they 'd been performing in .
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .
`` at first blush you think , `` '' hey it 's crazy , what could you possibly gain ? '' '' we created what we like to call superfly . ''
( laughter ) now , superfly , the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower , and you smear them across flytower and auditorium .
and because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements , suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional . and you can drill , cut , nail , screw paint and replace , with a minimum of cost .
and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
so , in fact , there is the building , there is what we call the draw .
here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space .
and some of the seats need to actually change their direction , and change their rake , to allow that to happen .
`` and they told us one important thing : `` you shall not beta-test . '' ''
in this case what we 're doing is we 're taking the orchestra floor , lifting it up , spinning it , changing the rake , taking it back to flat floor , changing the rake again . in essence , you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating , at will .
and ultimately , up in the flytower , the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur .
but you also have the ability to allow the audience to see dallas , to perform with dallas as the backdrop of your performance .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
we stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked , and you could see the guys doing this but you could n't hear them .
as i said , this can be done with only two people , and with a minimum amount of time .
again , just a couple people are required .
this is the at & t performing arts center 's dee and charles wyly theater .
you can see the winspear opera house on the right and the dee and charles wyly theater on the left .
i 've come here today to talk to you about a problem .
there are just so many examples , the horesemeat scandal in europe , the italian mafia , they 've used these companies for decades .
this is — i put it down at the bottom , but that was extemporaneous , obviously .
the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
and it 's not just stewardship and dominion debate , because really , dominion is implicit in stewardship — because how could you dominate something you had killed ?
`` if the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the clean air act , then i see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as , `` brain death for all children . no child left behind . '' ''
( applause ) so , the question is , how many federal officials are ready to move to ohio and pennsylvania with their families ?
air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .
we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that do n't .
during the dry season , we had four hours of water every fourth day .
`` if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mies ' 1928 tower for berlin , the question might be , `` '' well , where 's the sun ? '' '' and this might have worked in berlin , but we built it in houston , and the windows are all closed . and with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use , this is actually a vertical gas chamber . ''
that 's the pacific gyre .
`` so we 're looking for the design rules of this — this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world , irian jaya , 259 species of tree , and we described this in the book , `` '' cradle to cradle . '' '' the book itself is a polymer . it is not a tree . ''
`` that 's the name of the first chapter — `` '' this book is not a tree . '' '' because in poetics , as margaret atwood pointed out , `` '' we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears . '' '' and with so much polymer , what we really need is technical nutrition , and to use something as elegant as a tree — imagine this design assignment : design something that makes oxygen , sequesters carbon , fixes nitrogen , distills water , accrues solar energy as fuel , makes complex sugars and food , creates microclimates , changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates . ''
does it work ? do i like it ?
now most environmentalists do n't say growth is good , because , in our lexicon , asphalt is two words : assigning blame .
so instead of just growing destruction , we want to grow the things that we might enjoy , and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese .
the biological one i 'm sure you understand , but also the technical one , where we take materials and put them into closed cycles .
here 's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
and this is our project for ford motor company .
here it is . it 's the world 's largest green roof , 10 and a half acres .
this is the roof , saving money , and this is the first species to arrive here . these are killdeer .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
this is the site .
we lay out the building areas .
the solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city .
and this is the concept for the top of the city .
and we were so unsure that this would work .
`` let 's see if you can get something else . '' '' and we got the bear surrendered to — we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india . ''
so , we sponsor 600 children education programs today .
and the qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they 've lived all their lives .
this is revolution 2.0 .
everyone was scared .
not everyone . there were actually a few brave egyptians that i have to thank for being so brave — going into protests as a couple of hundred , getting beaten up and arrested .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , blackberry , sms .
it 's helping all of us to connect .
but then what was the answer of the regime ?
`` in a few days , tens of thousands of people there — angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs , `` '' enough . ''
`` to just bring them to justice . '' '' but of course , they do n't listen . ''
and things had developed until the tunisian revolution .
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
in fact , the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing .
yes we can . we can do it .
the revolution is happening .
but they detained me .
and i went out .
but also it 's part of being any monthly magazine — you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important , where it 's going , but also , very importantly , when — the timing is everything .
you 've probably seen something like this before .
we want to be the first to do it , for the geeks who appreciate that , we 'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger .
each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it ; it 's an opportunity for the technology to change .
but they 're getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . as they get cheaper , the premium brands , the sonys and such , are losing market share , and the no-names , the apexes , are gaining them .
today it 's less than 50 cents a day .
if you look here , here 's linux in red , and it 's hit 20 percent .
two percent is n't 20 percent , but in the car business , which is slow moving , that 's huge ; that 's arrival .
and what 's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
and they 're sticking together , forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface .
after about two to three weeks , we 're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness .
so the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
it does n't need light .
at this point , it 's really heavy .
i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigues me .
since it 's organic , i 'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
the dress would get really heavy , and eventually the seams would probably fall apart — leaving me feeling rather naked .
what excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
so i guess what my question to you is : in the future , what would you choose to grow ?
( applause ) bruno giussani : suzanne , just a curiosity , what you 're wearing is not random . ( suzanne lee : no . ) this is one of the jackets you grew ?
( video ) nicholas negroponte : can we switch to the video disc , which is in play mode ?
there is another way where computers touch people : wearing , physically wearing .
again , not generally accepted , but very much part of ted in the early days .
so that led to my own work with seymour in places like cambodia and the starting of one laptop per child .
and here 's the experiment .
so i said , well can we do this at a larger scale ?
and i 'm going to skip over my prediction , actually , because i 'm running out of time , and here 's the question , is what 's going to happen ?
you 're going to swallow a pill and know shakespeare .
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream .
well , that 's the way it was done for hundreds of years .
what was it ? what did i go through to make it be what it was ?
but through luck and an awful lot of perseverance , i was able to get computer time around the city .
have you heard of the linux and unix operating systems ?
they came from multics .
i worked on the multics versions of what are known as interpreted computer languages , that are used by people in noncomputer fields to do their calculations while seated at a computer terminal .
they 're usually all somewhat different .
lots of calculations — we got really close to our calculators .
my father taught me about prototyping .
and it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively .
the first thing i thought was the programmer way of doing it .
it became pretty clear pretty fast that that was going to be too tedious .
the computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside .
the next day in class , i raised my hand ; i got called on , and i presented the case .
`` the professor said , `` '' how did you do it ? '' '' well , i did n't want to tell him about our secret program . ''
people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store .
it was a dimly lit shack .
i wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
i wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .
and there , i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
in the late 50s , ghana and singapore had the same gdp .
the polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 am , but voters , eager to take their own political fate into their hands , were starting to line up at 4:00 am in the morning .
and i understood , this was their election , and they were n't going to let anyone take it away from them .
the rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
and then the cliche came to haunt us .
inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control .
and my heart sank , because i thought , here we are again .
`` they were chanting , `` '' we want peace . ''
it could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
but when it comes down to it , ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections — bush versus gore .
now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either .
and the other thing about these guys is , they also know what they do for a living .
but we do n't think about it that way .
but one reason is because it indicates a change , from before to after .
it is a moment in time .
it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .
`` and if i can just get enough money to tell enough people , i 'll sell enough . '' '' and you can build an entire industry on that . ''
what we 've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea , hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause , hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate .
the internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves , it becomes a movement .
and that means that the idea you create , the product you create , the movement you create is n't for everyone , it 's not a mass thing . that 's not what this is about .
it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services .
or from your book group . or from your friends , or from the circle you want .
now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechanics here .
they merely decided to lead them .
but she helped organize people , and helped turn it into a movement .
hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
`` he just stepped up and said , `` '' follow me . '' '' derek sivers invented cd baby , which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man — to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to , and connect with each other . ''
you just need a few people — ( laughter ) — who will look at the rules , realize they make no sense , and realize how much they want to be connected .
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it .
by leading a movement and making change .
because if you 're not upsetting anyone , you 're not changing the status quo .
so blake , at tom 's shoes , had a very simple idea .
they need the leadership . it makes a difference .
you do n't need permission from people to lead them .
they connect people to one another .
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living , related donors — relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver graft , to a relative or loved one .
and in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
i thought to myself , why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas — the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes — and transplant these cells ? — technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ .
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types — heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells — captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells — cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants .
and i started to see floaters and stars , which i casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure .
what happened to me might have been catastrophic , if not for the fact that i was in reach of good surgical access .
stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body , or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver .
as we speak , the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval .
( laughter ) he would have a great time .
and this makes many things fun , but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves .
they measure very , very carefully .
the way i think of it is , we ca n't learn to see until we admit we 're blind .
once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things .
`` and what 's happened , over the last 400 years in particular , is that human beings have invented `` '' brainlets '' '' — little additional parts for our brain — made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways . ''
it 's this change in perspective on what it is we think we 're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history .
`` but then i had a thought of , `` '' boy , maybe it 's too simple . '' '' and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side , and i found that they matched up very well . ''
but in fact , those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second ; they 're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds ; they 're completely crowded together , they 're jammed , they 're bashing up against each other .
and this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the , literally , 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered .
this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher , but was a natural mathematician .
she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two , so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there .
( video ) teacher : [ choose ] objects that you think will fall to the earth at the same time .
teacher : do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
teacher : drop . class : whoa !
and i thought i would do just one thing on the $ 100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here .
that means that we , once again , have a thing where we can put technology out , but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new ichat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing .
so what 's a good definition for cyborg ?
but humans are curious , and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next .
so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
`` i , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said , `` '' oh , wow . now suddenly we 're a new form of homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody 's doing around this technology . ''
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
and anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now , and so it 's very awkward , and it 's very difficult for them to do those things .
it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans .
so i started studying anthropology .
`` and i thought , `` '' oh , wow . i found it . this is great . '' '' so over time , time and space have compressed because of this . ''
`` we 're all `` '' i love lucy '' '' on a great assembly line of information , and we ca n't keep up . ''
one i 'm really worried about is that people are n't taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they are n't slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
and really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we 're co-creating each other all the time .
so that 's why i study cyborg anthropology .
( applause )
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
and for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and really you do the same thing .
i do n't see any reason why it should n't .
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this — like expanding and contracting bellows .
now it 's only at precise times when they align .
( laughter ) really .
how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ?
it 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
freely name any card in the deck .
by the way you reacted , i can see your lack of interest .
not only that , but i will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .
sir , what was the card ?
and this is the best secret i 've ever experienced .
`` but i was not really paying attention to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before , `` i will not touch the deck till the end . '' ''
now sir , you have the giraffe .
it was a black card .
and when i picked it up , that was the best secret i 've ever experienced .
i really do .
so you have the giraffe , go ahead , throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random .
do you have it ?
now not only that , i want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill .
up in the air .
madam , can you take the dollar bill ?
okay . let me criticize this thing .
`` you really do have to go and see his latest film , `` '' aliens of the deep . '' '' it’s incredible . ''
if you look at that sub , you’ll see a sphere .
and this one actually carries two great manipulators .
`` and then our mothers tell us , `` '' careful you don’t fall down '' '' — because you’ll fall over . ''
they don’t fall over . they don’t fall .
this is man’s first attempt at flying underwater .
right now , i’m just coming down on this gorgeous , big , giant manta ray .
and the craft that i’m in — this hasn’t been shown before .
she just rolled right away from underneath .
we just learned so much in three hours in the water there .
but look here . instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it , it’s a little bit of back pressure , and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water .
i don’t really look that ugly , but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted .
she’s just a few inches off the top of my head .
and he explained to me that , when i shave , i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry .
and what 's the brilliant idea he had ?
and this was very surprising to me , because i 've gone through many treatments — there were many treatments i decided not to do — and i never got this guilt trip to this extent .
`` where was this guilt trip coming from ? '' '' and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing . ''
so we had one group that i hoped their performance would be very high , another group that i thought their performance would be very low , and when i got the results , that 's what we got — i was very happy — aside from one person .
`` `` '' fantastic ! '' '' i thought . `` `` let 's throw him out . ''
so we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens .
and that 's a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
it is the landscape , right ?
we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like , you know , shoes , leather belts , handbags , etc. , where no sentient creature is harmed .
it 's victimless . it 's meat from a test tube .
we had a big show in prague , and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat .
i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the french revolution .
this , again , is life expectancy .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we 're looking at relative income or social position , social status — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
the measure we 've used , because it 's easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country .
but on the more unequal end — u.k. , portugal , usa , singapore — the differences are twice as big .
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i 've just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
it 's an extraordinarily close correlation .
that 's very important in poorer countries , but not in the rich developed world .
you see , at the more unequal end , it 's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others .
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .
it 's not just one or two things that go wrong , it 's most things .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
so we conclude that it does n't much matter how you get your greater equality , as long as you get there somehow .
another really surprising part of this picture is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality .
some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic classification .
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
but i should say a few words about what 's going on .
i should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data , we never pick and choose data .
otherwise that would introduce bias .
why do n't we control for other factors ?
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
at the beginning , i was just looking for a wall in my hometown , and it happened that the minaret was built in '94 .
`` when i met the imam for the first time , and i told him what i wanted to do , he was like , `` '' thank god you finally came , '' '' and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it . ''
in rio de janeiro , i translated this portuguese poem from gabriela tôrres barbosa , who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela , and then i painted it on the rooftop .
i was mad and disappointed .
i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries .
i could n't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital .
so the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of .
so the first one is made by a member of parliament , the second one is made by a spiritual leader , and the third one was actually the defendants ' lawyer when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away .
i talked about how i felt , i talked about the ground realities , and i talked about the frustrations of living in india .
three , i realized for the first time that my voice mattered .
when i reported about these events , i felt i had charge , i felt like i had a channel to release all the emotions i had inside me .
now in this situation where i was faced with so many different kinds of realities , i was unsure how to judge , because i did n't know what it would mean for me .
the university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment , and for the first the time , i felt i was n't alone .
today , more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in india , and this is a result of that courage .
when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it 's hardwired in our brains .
information technology progresses through a series of s-curves where each one is a different paradigm .
`` so people say , `` '' what 's going to happen when moore 's law comes to an end ? '' '' which will happen around 2020 . ''
the exponential growth of computing started decades before gordon moore was even born .
and it does n't just apply to computation .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
but what 's even more amazing , really , than this fantastic scale of progress , is that — look at how predictable this is .
i mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and recessions .
but look at how predictable this is .
`` some critics say , `` '' oh , well software is stuck in the mud . '' '' but we are learning more and more about the human brain . ''
it 's a new university that 's founded by peter diamandis , who is here in the audience , and myself .
and so that 's what we 've done .
there are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
the first six tracks here — artificial intelligence , advanced computing technologies , biotechnology , nanotechnology — are the different core areas of information technology .
and what i 'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation , how the will to survive can bring that out in people .
everest is an extreme environment .
it starts at base camp , at 17,500 feet .
this is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet .
when you 're in it , you 're like a rat in a maze ; you ca n't even see over the top .
we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached .
everybody 's on oxygen , your supplies are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly .
if you fall to your left , you 're going to fall 8,000 feet into nepal ; if you fall to your right , you 're going to fall 12,000 feet into tibet .
it was the worst winds i 've ever seen .
`` i expected them to say to rob , `` hold on . we 're coming . '' ''
the ones that could n't we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four .
his wife was home in new zealand , seven months pregnant with their first child , and rob asked to be patched into her . that was done , and rob and his wife had their last conversation .
i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet , which was an impossibility .
this is some severe frostbite on the feet , severe frostbite on the nose .
`` i expected him to be incoherent , but , in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me , `` hi , ken . where should i sit ? '' ''
it 's the last stage , just like a scar .
so the climbers passed him by , and beck lay there for a day , a night and another day , in the snow .
so let 's take a cut through the brain here , and imagine that beck was hooked up to a spect scan .
and this is how he 's going to turn thought back into action .
it 's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists .
and , you can see , there 's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain , where he 's got images of his family , into this area , which is powering his will .
so here i am taking care of beck at 21,000 feet , and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself .
a helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .
and one more climber should have died that day , but did n't , and that 's beck weathers .
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , beck 's message was answered .
you understood exactly what i just said in english .
is this difference in languages only between very , very distantly related languages , like english and chinese ?
you speak english , a futured language .
one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world .
take all of that data , combine it , and this map is what you get .
it 's current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
( applause )
( laughter ) my mother wanted me to be a dentist .
but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up .
we were programming in basic , which is a pretty awful language for games , so we ended up learning assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i 've done that .
it grows every year .
by 2010 , we 're going to hit 42 billion .
online gaming statistics .
it 's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it .
that 's what the show looks like .
and once we get enough of those guys , we 're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we 've never been to before , or characters that we 've just never seen before .
i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
video : i , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
i 'm a video game addict and this is my story .
i 'm addicted , because even though i know i 'm losing my grip on reality , i still crave more .
they allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive , downloaded , streaming , hd reality .
it lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional .
i know what i want and i do it .
i know violent video games make my mother worry .
these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds .
consider this — my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it .
i found that video very , very thought provoking , and that 's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see .
and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio .
they 're going to do it their way , using the tools that we 've created .
as far as colleges go , there 's about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
you know , we have the technology .
the winner to a game the other kids could n't play , i was the mystery of an anatomy , a question asked but not answered , tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl , and when i turned 12 , the boy phase was n't deemed cute anymore .
and i swallowed their insults along with their slurs .
`` called me by a name i did not recognize , said `` '' lesbian , '' '' but i was more boy than girl , more ken than barbie . ''
she claims i have turned myself into a mausoleum , that i am a walking casket , news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle , bruce jenner on everyone 's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages .
they 'll put me back into the closet , hang me with all the other skeletons .
and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit , and were helping people learn in a social way .
i mean , our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability .
`` `` '' absolutely , '' '' i said . ''
`` `` '' great , '' '' i said . got off the phone . ''
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
she kind of set us up .
( laughter ) and no , he did n't cook the fish , and he 's not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
they literally flipped the switch .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it 's what feeds the fish .
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
`` they 're feasting . '' '' feasting ? i was totally confused . ''
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
`` i said , `` '' miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ? ''
it 's the last defense before anything enters the body .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
thank you .
so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark .
and then finally , we 're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that 's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation , but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect .
this is indeed the true heart of the planet .
as a result , we have garbage patches the size of twice-texas .
it 's considered high seas , because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims .
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what , till recently , has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem .
we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative .
and fortunately , we 've been able , as iucn , to team up with the census of marine life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers .
but we need to think broad-scale . we need to think globally .
( applause )
so , if you 're in the audience today , or maybe you 're watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
whether you 're an artist , a technologist , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life .
well , it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database , along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match .
when we find a match , we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
and instead of sony blocking , they allowed the upload to occur .
and the song , 18 months old , went back to number four on the itunes charts .
`` the `` '' jk wedding [ entrance ] dance '' '' became so popular that nbc parodied it on the season finale of `` '' the office , '' '' which just goes to show , it 's truly an ecosystem of culture . ''
thank you .
but what is it ?
they go on and on .
how old do you think it was from when it was picked ?
two weeks ?
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition ?
what if ...
farming is hard .
it 's uncomfortable to talk about .
so how do we build this platform that inspires the youth ?
and then we built it .
these are all the broccoli in my lab that day , by ip address .
when does it achieve the nutrition that i need ?
when does it achieve the taste that i desire ?
is it getting too much water ?
is it getting too much sun ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) i think of that as the first user on the plant facebook , right ?
roots are not that complicated , so when you give them that , you get this amazing expression .
and because it has two hearts , it grows four or five times faster .
i am the only person in this room that 's eaten that kind of tomato .
`` why did n't you just tell me that ? '' '' ( laughter ) we 've created an interface for this that 's much like a game . ''
these are farmers , electrical engineer , mechanical engineer , environmental engineer , computer scientist , plant scientist , economist , urban planners .
we know what 's wrong with this .
all right , the moment of truth .
what you 'll see is that , right before your eyes — this video is sped up about sixtyfold — this little piece of brain tissue is going to grow .
it can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume .
so now we can take actual brain circuitry — here 's a piece of the brain involved with , for example , memory — and we can zoom in .
jc : so as a couple , we both had a need to find stories of hope .
`` so we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the `` '' supergays . '' '' ( laughter ) these would be the lgbt individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world . ''
ld : there was just one problem .
jc : one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal .
here 's bhumika : ( video ) bs : what i 'm most proud of ?
i had to come up with a strategy , so that i could just pee in peace .
i ca n't be anything else .
and in that way , the status of lgbt people can be affirmed as well .
he 's the world 's first openly gay prince .
whether we are gay , we are lesbian , we are transgender , bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from , we have to all unite and fight for our rights .
gay rights can not be won in the court rooms , but in the hearts and the minds of the people .
now , this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy westerner .
in kenya , 89 percent of people who come out to their families are disowned .
david had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government .
and , yeah , there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation .
maría rachid ( spanish ) : i always say that , in reality , the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married .
i feel very proud of argentina because argentina today is a model of equality .
( laughter ) a whole community of young , beautiful chinese lgbt people .
turns out , it was n't hard to find them at all .
what we ultimately took away from our journey is , equality is not a western invention .
when argentina embraced marriage equality , uruguay and brazil followed .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
this directive [ is ] called data retention directive .
`` they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : `` '' we do n't want this . '' '' and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said , `` freedom , not fear . '' ''
so i asked my phone company , deutsche telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in germany , and i asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
i want to make them public .
so together with zeit online and open data city , i did this .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it 's not outdated .
when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they do n't have to do it .
they 've been here for billions of years , and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms .
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
at the best , you 're 10 percent human , but more likely about one percent human , depending on which of these metrics you like .
but when the bacteria grow and double and they 're all participating in making these molecules , the molecule — the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number .
again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .
( laughter ) but then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem because it 's got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it ca n't sustain that .
we also then went to look at what are these molecules — these were the red triangles on my slides before .
these conversations are for intraspecies communication .
so this is just a picture — a micrograph of your skin .
anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what i hope you can see is that there 's all kinds of bacteria there .
it 's used by all different bacteria and it 's the language of interspecies communication .
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well .
we thought , what if we made these bacteria so they ca n't talk or they ca n't hear ?
could n't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules — which you saw — but they 're a little bit different .
and so they lock into those receptors , and they jam recognition of the real thing .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium — a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium — in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
we know that the principles and the rules , if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms , the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .
again , we think that bacteria invented that , and you 've just evolved a few more bells and whistles , but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study .
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .
now , it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet .
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it .
what they 'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
so actually , in the early days , back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times — there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts do n't know exactly what 's going on .
it 's basically a matter of deciding to do it .
but people wo n't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that 's the problem that we have right now .
they 've created our wealth .
but today 's energy system is not just inefficient , it is also disconnected , aging , dirty and insecure .
two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight .
and just in the first two years the biggest of europe 's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency .
do n't worry about dropping it , it 's tougher than titanium .
so to get mobility without oil , to phase out the oil , we can get efficient and then switch fuels .
in fact , three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil , not in supply , but in demand .
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings .
that is , it can give you expanding returns , not diminishing returns .
but industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save .
for example , three-fifths of the world 's electricity runs motors .
but first we ought to be capturing bigger , cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
this is not about new technology , it 's just rearranging our metal furniture .
of course , it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs .
so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors ?
`` but now let 's turn those compounding losses around backwards , and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost , pollution and what hunter lovins calls `` '' global weirding '' '' back at the power plant . ''
our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns — everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries .
typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years , while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost .
already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill .
such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company .
but we only need to replace them once .
and that 's true both for continental areas like the u.s. or europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid .
in america , our aging , dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value — whether we buy more of what we 've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or renewables that are more or less centralized .
but that blackout risk disappears , and all of the other risks are best managed , with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect , but can stand alone at need .
but with today 's much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
each of you owns a piece of that $ 5 trillion prize .
but all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common : they began with a dream .
at the time , all weapons were made by hand to different specifications .
this was edward teach , better known as the british pirate , blackbeard .
he even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight , so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack .
yet design was also used to nobler ends by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer , the 19th-century british nurse , florence nightingale .
now , it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design .
and we 're living at a remarkable moment in design , because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together .
and this of course saves many patients from making long , arduous , expensive and often pointless journeys to those hospitals , and makes it much , much likelier that their hearts will actually be checked .
then there 's gabriel maher , who is developing a new design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities , without recourse to traditional stereotypes .
thank you .
it did n't increase smoothly .
so we 're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this .
this is a beautiful holothurian as well .
you 're going to see a picture of one in a moment .
it 's made of calcium carbonate , so you can see its tentacles there , moving in the ocean currents .
and here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system , and we put it into a sampling container .
so here we are .
thank you .
we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
about two thirds , i would guess , of the world is desertifying .
think of it in terms of drums of water , each containing 200 liters .
when i was a young man , a young biologist in africa , i was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks .
and it got worse , not better .
and i found that american scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it 's now going into eight months of dry season .
to prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
but fire also leaves the soil bare , releasing carbon , and worse than that , burning one hectare of grassland gives off more , and more damaging , pollutants than 6,000 cars .
and bear in mind , i 'm talking of most of the world 's land now .
there is no other alternative left to mankind .
we 'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature , and we 've done so , and look at that .
we 'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals , but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world .
thank you .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
( applause )
dh : thank you .
ted is about invention , let 's be honest . right ? dh : yeah , it is .
`` and then we thought , `` '' how stupid . '' '' dh : excuse me , could we work on the design of the microphone ? ''
bf : sure .
rw : in all past years i 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me — i have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth .
rw : do i get to hold them ?
bf : you do n't want to hold these , trust me .
( laughter ) dh : wow ! bf : hoping for a little more build .
just trying to play the odds . all right , here we go .
dh : the french judge gives it a 5.2 .
dh : that 's right .
dh : i touched it , barry . that should be enough .
and it 's awfully windy over there .
( laughter ) you are my hero . you 're my jim shea , jr .
what pearl of wisdom ?
and the way clayton put it was this way .
and these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged .
we are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
i recently sailed on the hokulea , named after the sacred star of hawaii , throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators .
these are sailors who in the darkness , in the hull of the vessel , can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time , distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean , that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea .
what is buddhism but 2,500 years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind ?
the third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome .
i spent 30 years living amongst the people of chinchero and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in .
but these localized rituals become pan-andean , and these fantastic festivals , like that of the qoyllur rit'i , which occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky .
and then beyond salcantay , of course , when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky , directly in that same alignment , the milky way overhead .
all that time , the world only exists as an abstraction , as they are taught the values of their society .
the gourd is a feminine aspect ; the stick is a male .
fields are planted in such an extraordinary way , that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women .
it 's going to look like a john ford western .
and of course , this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding , as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains .
on the contrary , you know , if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see , you discover that the world is not flat .
the world remains a rich tapestry .
it remains a rich topography of the spirit .
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
what is raveling ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
due to weathering , due to u.v . light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro-cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
induction can heat , especially steel ; it 's very good at that .
then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
`` we tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , `` '' well , that 's very interesting . we have to try that . '' '' so they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the a58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material . ''
( cheers ) wait , wait . what ?
so we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that .
we would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it .
`` privilege is invisible to those who have it . '' '' it is a luxury , i will say to the white people sitting in this room , not to have to think about race every split second of our lives . privilege is invisible to those who have it . ''
`` is that going to be on the test ? how do you spell 'structural ' ? '' '' ( laughter ) so i hope you all can see , this is what objectivity looks like . ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) disembodied western rationality . ( laughter )
it is also good for companies .
`` so the question i 'm often asked in companies is , `` boy , this gender equality thing , that 's really going to be expensive , huh ? '' ''
`` it is extremely expensive . '' '' so it is good for business . ''
when i was a lot younger , there was a riddle that was posed to us .
no problem . just like that .
younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family .
for an example , we can make a 300-tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars .
and using these simple improvisations , today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iphone .
( applause )
so as good citizens , we clean up the beaches — and no , he is not drinking alcohol , and if he is , i did not give it to him .
and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid 's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work .
but , there 's a technology that 's rather simple , that 's called spectrometry , that allows you see what 's in the water .
and today , i read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the pacific ocean .
so of course we did n't take the kids , the parents would n't allow that to happen .
and it 's been super exciting to work at these different scales , with also very simple , open-source technologies .
we have n't even started to try to solve the problems .
and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
or , can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool , electric vehicles ?
`` maybe i can work tomorrow , but i do n't know if and when yet . '' '' and it 's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly . ''
they 'd have to be available at very competitive rates .
so in this example , a distribution company has said , we 've got a rush order that we 've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning .
and they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking .
she may be interested in providing local services to her community : babysitting , local deliveries , pet care .
`` she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed , she can go to taskrabbit.com and say , `` '' i want to do local deliveries , '' '' and so on . ''
it analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from .
basically classified adverts with a search facility .
a modern market is more than a website ; it 's a web of interoperable marketplaces , back office mechanisms , regulatory regimes , settlement mechanisms , liquidity sources and so on .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
like everyone else , those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves .
`` how do i make that happen ? '' '' and i think i can see a few eyes rolling . ''
there is a precedent for technology-enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful : national lotteries .
our government did n't design the national lottery , it did n't fund the national lottery , it does n't operate the national lottery .
so it 's on a par with the water supply or the road network .
it 's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them .
but it could be very different , because having access to those state-backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service .
so if there 's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training , an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years .
and it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains , we being human beings , true , have our brains packaged .
how does this happen ?
dr. caroline mills and her team received this patient and did n't really know what to do about it .
it was intolerable .
after five years , it went away on its own .
try one of two conditions .
it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think .
and then a week later , it 's still rattling around in their heads and all they want to do is tell their friends about it .
it 's very difficult , numerically , to win a prize if you want to .
you get an ig nobel prize .
they ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars .
the man responsible , who runs the national bank there , by the way , won an ig nobel prize in mathematics .
the other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony , which happens at harvard university .
it fits 1,100 people , it 's jammed to the gills , and up on the stage , waiting to shake your hand , waiting to hand you your ig nobel prize , are a bunch of nobel prize winners .
dr. barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor , he wanted to see the world .
a coconut tree that is 90 feet tall , and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time .
a team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies .
the gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
and then they wanted to be able to see , they needed light , so they 'd put in a light source , which in the 1950s was very hot .
she was one of the doctors who treated victims of the chernobyl power plant meltdown .
so she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens .
she had a baby , one day she looked , and on the floor , her infant son had picked up her bra , and had her bra on his face .
will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years , or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?
when you want to classify religion , it 's more difficult than you think .
islam is the majority religion all the way from the atlantic ocean across the middle east , southern europe and through asia all the way to indonesia .
and that is most countries in america and europe , many countries in africa and a few in asia .
so we were careful with that .
so bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot .
the exception was japan .
otherwise it was only christian countries .
but there was also many christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
but they were in latin america or they were in africa .
and then when we look at religions , we can see that the eastern religions , indeed there 's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children .
whereas with islam as a majority religion and christianity , you see countries all the way .
but there 's no major difference .
they have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman .
i take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
very interesting . lots to read .
i found fertility at birth , and i looked at total fertility rate per woman .
but it 's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more .
`` for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , `` '' something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . '' '' in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a — for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body ''
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s .
and then i 'll explain why i explained it .
obviously it 's clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
if you have capsules , they 're more effective than tablets in any form .
dosage has something to do with this .
so , let me give you a little peek .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
i 'm sorry . if you 're getting queasy , look away , do n't look at the thing .
`` people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , `` '' well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be — see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding . ''
( laughter ) yes , there it is .
it 's all or none , you 're with us or against us .
i do n't think it 's an unattainable , harmonious utopia , i think the opposite of polarity is duality .
duality is a state of having two parts , but not in diametrical opposition , in simultaneous existence .
( applause ) duality is the ability to hold both things .
she was from mexico , she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home .
i would rather have her say lover , than say nothing at all .
if it does n't matter to you who i sleep with , then you can not imagine what it feels like when i walk down the street late at night holding her hand , and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if i should hang on to it or if i should i drop it when all i want to do is squeeze it tighter .
so , back to toledo , ohio .
all that matters is the smile on her face .
a couple of examples .
but what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
another example : have you ever been to venice ?
but our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
i know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge , but i push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task , or maybe turning your digital senses totally off .
this is the next step in the evolution .
now , i 'm not thinking about a distant future .
momentarily , i am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage , just as clearly as i can see all of you .
think of it this way : let 's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television .
i love it down here .
and the world ?
the world was mesmerized .
this is a precise holographic replica of mars , built from data captured by the curiosity mars rover , that i can explore as easily as a place on earth .
we can instantly understand an environment , just by being present in it .
i take inspiration from our ancestors .
hw : so there 's been some talk in the press .
talk about this field of view issue .
it 's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is .
( laughter ) ak : he did show up ! i told you he 'd show up .
hw : and it was beautiful .
hw : hi .
ak : i 'll take a step back .
tell me more about the fact that , with holograms , you have sight but you do n't have touch , you do n't have smell .
i am a native of burkina faso .
i had a scholarship .
since i was a student , i wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando .
( laughter ) it 's not photoshopped . ( laughter ) this is the school , built with the community .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
i started to build a prototype like that .
we start making a lot of mortars , like you can see , and when everything is ready , when you know what is the best recipe and the best form , you start working with the community .
they will do it themselves .
it brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build .
for sure , it has opened opportunities .
there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death , and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .
so , i got a gun and started to shoot at the image of diana , but i could n't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche .
momentum was being built .
and similarly with the di-dodian baby imagery — this is another art gallery installation .
in the photograph , the real subject does n't exist so it makes you want that person more .
of course , the queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
`` in england there 's an expression : `` '' you ca n't imagine the queen on the loo . '' '' so i 'm trying to penetrate that . ''
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media — because we do n't know the real people ; very few of us know the real people — but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing , effectively , my filthy work .
i was being asked and paid to do front covers .
how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
this is the look-alike , so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous .
but there was a real legal problem because it looks real , but how do you get over that ?
but the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on , you 're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that 's all you 're doing .
when you take the logo off , you 're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive , opposed to conclusive when you are advertising .
this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper , broadsheets and tabloids .
also , people were taking photographs of this , so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery .
further imagery . i 'm making a new book now with taschen that i 'm working on really for a sort of global market — my previous book was only for the u.k. market — that i suppose it could be called humorous .
it 's extremely difficult if it 's constructed correctly , and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery .
and then you change the photograph he 's shooting at , and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible . ( laughter ) .
and in fact , george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this .
this meant that one employee was responsible for 180 inhabitants , which was really unique in the world .
last but not least , the stasi had its own armed forces .
please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented .
the stasi even collected the smell of people .
for the minister of state security , these so-called unofficial employees were the most important tools .
in nearly every institution , even in the churches or in west germany , there were many of them .
he wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning .
if yes , the stasi often used a method which was really diabolic .
for this , the stasi owned 17 remand prisons , one in every district .
secondly , in the communist ideology , there 's no place for criticism .
the ending of the stasi was something tragic , because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing : to destroy the documents they had produced during decades .
what 's your reaction as a historian when you see this ?
so that makes a fundamental difference .
the third point , probably , we really can be happy that we live in a democracy , because you can be sure that russia and china are doing the same , but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that .
hk : yeah , i did so because of the second point i mentioned , that i think especially in a democracy , the rules are for everybody .
hk : i take it as a good sign , because people feel secure in this democracy .
bg : a personal question , and this is the last one .
hk : oh , that 's a difficult question , but if you ask me , and if i answer honestly , i would give him the asylum , because i think it was really brave what he did , and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything .
so i think , for these people , we should do something , and especially if you see the german history , where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they did n't get it , so it would be a good sign to give him asylum .
so i went out and researched ethanol , and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
we have a battery bay . it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .
imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road .
( laughter ) until i got to the true young global leader , shimon peres , president of israel , and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me .
and actually true to form , renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume — mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars .
it 's the first mass-volume electric car , zero-emission electric car in the market .
it 's inversely proportional to taxes .
i know most people do n't think of israel as a small island , but israel is an island — it 's a transportation island .
we decided to come into the u.s .
it 's called the other car .
then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 — sometimes it 's 40 , sometimes it 's 50 .
now we 're running a stimulus package .
it 's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package .
that 's all the u.s. usage today .
we go back down . it 's going to go up and down .
now we actually looked at what the answer would be .
that is 0.5 percent of the u.s. oil consumption .
europe has solved it . they just put a tax on gasoline .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and some of it will go back to the car maker .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years .
that 's one percent a year .
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
i shared it with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr. , who is one of my idols .
thank you all very much .
okay , religious mania : there 's rapture , there 's weeping , there 's visions .
how many people are trying to learn english worldwide ?
t : i want to speak perfect english !
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
so everybody knew this is a , not a useless project , this is an absolute damaging , a terrible project — not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars , and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools , like hospitals and so on .
and yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented .
but these bad projects , which were absolutely damaging — for the economy for many generations , for the environment , for thousands of families who had to be resettled — they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks , of supplier agencies , of insurance agencies — like in germany , hermes , and so on — and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north .
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
and so , i became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries , which is the main reason for the misery , for the poverty , for the conflicts , for the violence , for the desperation in many of these countries .
now , why did the world bank not let me do this work ?
`` we will lose to the french , we will lose to the swedes , we 'll lose to the japanese . '' '' and therefore , there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma , which made it very difficult for an individual company , an individual exporting country to say , `` '' we are not going to continue this deadly , disastrous habit of large companies to bribe . '' '' so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure , because even the powerful government , which we have in germany , comparatively , was not able to say , `` we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . '' ''
and this is why i 'm telling you this : civil society rose to the occasion .
( applause ) well , thank you . i mean , it 's interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
we had here in berlin , at the aspen institute on the wannsee , we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry , and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery .
this is what these other cultures demand .
in london , for instance , where the bae got away with a huge corruption case , which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute , 100 million british pounds , every year for ten years , to one particular official of one particular friendly country , who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment .
civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the u.k. , and also in japan , which is not properly enforcing , and so on .
by now , the united nations is totally on our side .
of course , if civil society organizations want to play that role , they have to grow into this responsibility .
not all civil society organizations are good .
( applause )
so my first question : where is google and where is it going ?
but actually , when i think about search , it 's such a deep thing for all of us , to really understand what you want , to understand the world 's information , and we 're still very much in the early stages of that , which is totally crazy .
so really having computing work and understand you and understand that information , we really have n't done that yet .
first , let me tell you the way we got there , which was looking at search and really understanding , trying to understand everything , and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you — like , voice was really important .
so i think deep mind , what 's really amazing about deep mind is that it can actually — they 're learning things in this unsupervised way .
this is boxing , and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down .
cr : when you look at all that 's taken place with deep mind and the boxing , also a part of where we 're going is artificial intelligence .
designed by machines , seen by machines .
so this is learned from just watching youtube .
`` ( video ) [ `` '' soy , kenya '' '' ] zack matere : not long ago , i planted a crop of potatoes . ''
( applause ) lp : now , the amazing thing about that video , actually , was we just read about it in the news , and we found this gentlemen , and made that little clip .
it sounds totally crazy .
lp : yeah , but it turns out , we did some weather simulations which probably had n't really been done before , and if you control the altitude of the balloons , which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways , you can actually control roughly where they go , and so i think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet .
cr : before i talk about the future and transportation , where you 've been a nerd for a while , and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles , let me talk a bit about what 's been the subject here earlier with edward snowden .
you have to have been thinking about that .
i think we need to have a debate about that , or we ca n't have a functioning democracy .
i also think it 's very easy .
and i look at , on your show , actually , i kind of lost my voice , and i have n't gotten it back .
cr : absolutely . let me go — ( applause ) lp : so i guess i 'm just very worried that with internet privacy , we 're doing the same thing we 're doing with medical records , is we 're throwing out the baby with the bathwater , and we 're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways .
i 'm super excited about getting that out quickly .
they 're getting used 24 hours a day .
lp : yeah , let 's show the video .
you have this idea of [ google x ] .
and i think the more you can do things like that , the bigger impact you have , and that 's about doing things that people might not think are possible .
i think of somebody you knew and read about , tesla .
cr : you once said , actually , as i think i 've got this about right , that you might consider , rather than giving your money , if you were leaving it to some cause , just simply giving it to elon musk , because you had confidence that he would change the future , and that you would therefore — lp : yeah , if you want to go mars , he wants to go to mars , to back up humanity , that 's a worthy goal , but it 's a company , and it 's philanthropical .
they 're where most of people 's time is , where a lot of the money is , and so i think i 'd like for us to help out more than we are .
what quality of mind , as i leave this audience , has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present ?
we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies .
what did those companies all do wrong ?
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ? do you know how many choices you make
now i 'm going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent — a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
`` you know , often , people say , `` '' i do n't know how to cut . ''
`` and if your employees ca n't tell them apart , neither can your consumers . '' '' now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary . ''
( honk ) now who 's ready to go on this trip .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
here are two different jewelry displays .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , clap your hands .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
what am i going to look at ?
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you 're getting overwhelmed , that means i 'm losing you .
we 're losing them .
so let me recap .
then i understood this — adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days .
i wore a sanitary pad . i filled animal blood in a football bottle , i tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while i 'm walking , while i 'm cycling , i made a press , doses of blood will go there .
why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
it is the same in the 21st century . that 's why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india .
so far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
they are performing puja .
i do n't want to make this as a corporate entity .
it can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
we know that , right ? we 've experienced that .
and we 're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
cannery row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean — i have to tell you — we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that should n't be there , some very frightening things happen .
pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like pcbs that ca n't be broken down by our bodies .
now suppose , instead of styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
pcbs accumulate .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
`` and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , `` well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , '' but it was so awful . ''
that means their immune systems are compromised .
we 've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
not very often . we would n't tolerate that .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
in 1931 , she produced california 's first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
thank you very much .
it 's our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well .
the sound around us is affecting us even though we 're not conscious of it .
there 's a second way though , as well .
hospital sound is getting worse all the time .
`` it 's when we regenerate , when we rebuild ourselves , and with threatening noise like this going on , your body , even if you are able to sleep , your body is telling you , `` '' i 'm under threat . this is dangerous . '' '' and the quality of sleep is degraded , and so is our recovery . ''
education .
`` ( `` '' do architects have ears ? '' '' ) ( laughter ) now , that 's a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . ( laughter ) and they definitely do have ears . ''
the children could n't hear their teachers .
old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
a study in florida just a few years ago found that if you 're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom , row four , speech intelligibility is just 50 percent .
if you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments , sound absorbing materials and so forth , this is what you get .
now that education you would receive , and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations . the signal was the same , the background noise was the same .
if education can be likened to watering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sadly , much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing impairment .
add those up . that is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly .
in fact , 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that , that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction .
to you and me , that 's a heart attack .
i 'm glad that debate is happening on this .
and in our offices , we spend a lot of time at work .
it 's about designing , not appearance , but experience , so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look , that are fit for purpose , that improve our quality of life , our health and well being , our social behavior and our productivity .
and this is the first stop along the line .
( laughter ) so at this point , she decides to put the rape book away . ( laughter )
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared — she had been hiding behind a display — and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
you can see them in this footage .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
( laughter ) or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire .
so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities , but that broad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health .
( laughter ) and i think we see this tremendous variation because it 's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem , and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes .
you would n't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another .
a reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring , and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool .
it has to be part of the explanation .
and if you were n't just looking at a little section of the fibers , those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton — something like a chinese finger trap , where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck .
but instead i saw this .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
( applause )
the curator had only one condition : i had to use the arabic script for my artwork .
on everything ever produced under islamic or arab patronage in the past 1,400 years , from spain to the borders of china .
now , in january , 2011 , the revolution started , and life stopped for 18 days , and on the 12th of february , we naively celebrated on the streets of cairo , believing that the revolution had succeeded .
no to barrier walls . on february 5th , concrete roadblocks were set up in cairo to protect the ministry of defense from protesters .
this is not an exhaustive list ; i 'm probably missing 3-7 items .
and in that moment of openness , a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information , and if they 're really skilled , a rectal exam .
it 's about justice .
( applause and cheers ) thank you .
but yes , sometimes i get run off the grounds by security .
and those death threats are definitely not funny .
but — hang on , because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive .
we are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours , free of charge , go ahead .
fact-checked over and over again , conservative , it 's the truth .
and all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere , the whole earth system .
as it moves over tucson , arizona .
last july in houston , texas , it rained for two days , 162 billion gallons .
there 's so much extra energy in the atmosphere , there 's so much extra water vapor .
more lightning , as the heat energy builds up , there 's a considerable amount of additional lightning also .
these climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability .
but the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors , like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them .
this is also connected to the extinction crisis .
when you measure it by assets at risk , number one is miami : three and a half trillion dollars at risk .
and there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of miami beach and fort lauderdale and del rey .
this is a crisis that 's getting worse day by day .
the international energy agency says only this amount can be burned .
a lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis .
we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves .
now , the business community has certainly noticed this , because it 's crossing the grid parity point .
the big expansion has been in the developing counties .
muhammad yunus financed this one in bangladesh with micro-credit .
this is a village market .
`` that 'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole . '' '' now i was n't trying to be smart . ''
i was n't trying to be funny .
`` i took one look at the road map of life , and i ran off down the street marked `` '' geek '' '' as fast as my chubby , asthmatic little legs would carry me . ''
one is not prime .
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
they keep going on forever .
today we 're going to hunt for that massive prime .
do n't freak out .
frank nelson cole did not stop there .
it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format — and for the rest of the hour of his talk frank nelson cole busted that out .
`` it took him , by his estimate , `` three years of sundays . '' ''
but then in the field of mathematics , as in so many of the fields that we 've heard from in this ted , the age of the computer goes along and things explode .
in an amazing moment of serendipity , i had to send ted a new slide to show you what this guy had done .
i was doing my breakfast radio show .
it 's because of curtis cooper that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 57,885,161 .
( laughter ) written out as a book , this number would run the length of the harry potter novels and half again .
and who am i kidding when i say almost ?
you think that 's cool .
it was n't my highlight of 2012 .
no , it was n't . the highlight of 2012 , so clearly , was the discovery of the higgs boson .
`` it 's beyond our reach . '' '' and within just 50 years , in his lifetime , with him sitting in the audience , we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind . ''
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
let 's start with how i got to this point .
by then we had two grandchildren , sophie and connor .
but there were consequences .
it 's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year .
climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
now consider earth 's climate history .
so co2 , methane , and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge , even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .
the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today .
methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
there would be no stable shoreline .
what may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world , causing massive famines and economic decline .
imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with earth .
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .
i have a doppelganger .
( laughter ) but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination , my motives are not sinister .
now wait a minute , you may say , how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first ?
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
it dates back at least 200 years , to galvani 's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond .
it 's hard to do in animals that run around , and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously .
`` so around the turn of the last century , i started to think , `` '' would n't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down ? '' '' so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain , re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light . ''
but these pores here are special .
so in this cartoon , the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore .
now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see , susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment .
they did n't get very far , obviously .
whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet , it has to make a decision .
now for an intelligent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor .
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right , you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet , it marches straight through , as it did before .
its behavior is completely unchanged .
based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies , this makes perfect sense .
now consider a situation in which the motors stay off , the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
and we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call westerners : europeans , north americans , australasians .
they start off pretty close together .
when you get to the 1970s , which is where this chart ends , the average briton is more than 10 times richer than the average indian .
and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place with , notice , the same basic traditional culture , and we divided them in two , and we gave the northerners communism .
not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly , but in almost every other respect , it 's a huge divergence .
but you know , this is a ted audience , and if i keep talking about institutions , you 're going to turn off .
the ancestor of the modern corporation , the city of london corporation , existed in the 12th century .
hardly anyone in south america did .
it does n't rise any faster after these countries become independent .
the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point .
very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi 's road .
max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant .
in fact , the west has lost its work ethic .
and this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon , and that is the end of the great divergence .
you 're wrong .
in terms of patents , there 's no question that the east is ahead .
it 's open source .
because it 's on your watch that this is happening .
it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance .
the average american used to be more than 20 times richer than the average chinese .
now it 's just five times , and soon it will be 2.5 times .
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights .
that 's the basis for the western model of representative government .
`` `` '' when civilization reigns in any country , a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people . '' '' that 's so true . ''
no , we may hang on , despite the huge burdens of debt that we 've accumulated , despite the evidence that we 've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo .
what 's your view on that ?
he was an expert in latin american history .
mostly they 're worried about each other .
it 's not about technology , it 's about people and stories .
and it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran 's administration — who , himself , had lost an arm 39 years ago in vietnam — who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that do n't work .
the bad news is if they 've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg , part of the face , it 's probably not coming back .
so he wants fine motor control : flex at the wrist , flex at the elbow , abduct and flex at the shoulder .
and trust me , i 've got a day job , i 've got a lot of day jobs .
but i figured i got ta do this .
anyway , with less than 10 hours of use , two guys — one that 's bilateral .
`` so , you 've got a choice : we keep the arm , or you keep chuck . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) so , can we see that ? ''
this is chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints .
they 're probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated .
we 're probably going to have to give them support , encouragement .
i could give you fine motor control , or i could let you curl 40 pounds ; i probably ca n't do both .
`` `` '' guys , and woman , you 've given enough . ''
he had a great spirit , like all the rest of them had great spirits .
he 's got no arms .
and , as i think you get the point , there were a lot people there recovering .
but universally , these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes , and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them .
i 'll shut up , except one message or concern i have .
`` but i was saying to him , `` '' you know , the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903 . ''
but you know what ? it would n't have made an old pigeon jealous .
and we ought to give it to them .
but would n't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
and four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 34 , and yes , the pattern continues .
six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?
( laughter ) fibonacci ! of course .
let 's look at that last equation .
well , on the one hand , it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
just as we created it .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
in this picture , i 've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
it may seem like we 're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
they help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
`` `` that 's fine , '' says george , `` i 'll take the soup . '' ''
they 're , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females .
would n't you want to make those changes in your genes ?
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
i was literally up to my eyes in leonardo , and i had been for three years .
he shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm .
all the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day — over the phone .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
i mean , it 's a color that i ca n't think of anything that you actually see in nature , that looks that shade .
where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy .
( laughter ) so , there i was — in a sort of paroxysm of horror .
they had this kind of odd sort of fascination , like a car accident .
how many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece ?
so just as in the 20th century , so many people had the idea that their faith took place on the sabbath day , and the rest of their lives — their lives of washing machines and orthodontics — took place on another day .
there 's an idea that we do n't want these anxious-making , imaginative journeys to happen in our daily lives .
( laughter ) i found him on the internet when i was looking up a reference .
and there he was .
in fact , reader , i married him . i bought him .
and he now adorns my office .
but more than that , i love him .
in a way that i think would have been impossible without the pink sèvres vase in my leonardo days .
i love his orange and pink breeches .
so this is zig in this photograph , this is also one of zig 's photographs .
is this thing off ?
♫ i sing . julia sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sobule : sometimes it works . sweeney : sometimes it does n't . ♫ ♫ together : the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sweeney : at a conference in monterey next to the big , big jellyfish tank , ♫ ♫ i first saw you and i was n't so shy . ♫ i made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan i was ever since i was writing that pilot for fox , and wendy and i wanted you to do the theme song .

and on this axis , i 'm showing dollars per person in income .
there were quite many people infected in the united states .
look , india got many infected , but had a low level .
in the last two to three years , we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world .
drugs is too costly — had we had the vaccine , or when we will get the vaccine , that 's something more effective — but the drugs are very costly for the poor .
and you 'll find madagascar , and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world .
no , it 's not . look here .
and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo — they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful zambia — much higher .
and , i ca n't avoid showing kenya .
i will swap the bubbles to a map .
unaids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
( applause )
so i 'm a neurosurgeon .
and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body , the brain has very little ability for self-repair .
i often had to take care of patients with head trauma .
and then label them , to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain .
those are the cells that were re-implanted .
so on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
so now , i 'd like you to imagine playing a very different role , that of the scout .
but above all , the scout wants to know what 's really there , as accurately as possible .
but dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army , and unfortunately at this time , the french army was highly anti-semitic .
as far as we can tell , the officers genuinely believed that the case against dreyfus was strong .
we can think we 're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man .
`` but at a certain point , picquart began to suspect : `` what if we 're all wrong about dreyfus ? '' ''
so they can believe that capital punishment works .
( applause )
we taught it things like passes , shots and rebounds .
so , luckily , with machine learning , we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know .
and why is it so important to them ? so here 's a little insight .
so why is this important ?
the size is the size of the player and the color is the position .
but today , i can tell you that player takes shots that an average nba player would make 49 percent of the time , and they are two percent worse .
tie game with five seconds left .
the crowd goes wild .
( applause ) roughly . ( applause )
way to go , daria .
it 's the fact you do n't have to be a professional team to track movement .
we 're moving in our homes , in our offices , as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world .
i believe that with the development of the science of moving dots , we will move better , we will move smarter , we will move forward .
he felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman .
so after dinner , the orchestra started to play , and the guests burst into song , and all of a sudden , taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters , and this was a stuffed opossum toy , all beady-eyed and bald-eared , and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency 's answer to teddy roosevelt 's teddy bear .
there were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags .
it 's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors .
so we 've gone hands-on and we ca n't ever take our hands off , and that 's a hell of a lot of work .
it 's open source , meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online , allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design .
it 's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the rovs james cameron used to explore the titanic .
what we 've built is n't unique .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
so about that time , our little expedition became quite a story , and it got picked up in the new york times .
but we were able to do it , we got all the kits made , thanks a lot to techshop , which was a big help to us , and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year , so it was just a few months ago .
but we 're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world , including this shot from under the ice in antarctica .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
it 's an underwater world we 're all exploring together .
this is the modern middle east , where two millennia after the coming of christ , virgin births are still a fact of life .
like so many who straddle east and west , i 've been drawn , over the years , to try to better understand my origins .
you know , as for that third red line , that off-limits subject , what do you think it might be ?
and around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex , against condoms , against abortion , against homosexuality , you name it .
only she became pregnant all the same .
`` but sex , everybody is doing it , but nobody wants to talk about it . '' '' ( laughter ) ( music ) ( in arabic ) sef : i want to give you a piece of advice , which if you follow it , will make you happy in life . ''
social change does n't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation , beating or indeed baring of breasts , but rather through negotiation .
that path , i hope , will one day lead us to the right to control our own bodies , and to access the information and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives .
now given the turmoil in many countries in the arab region , talking about sex , challenging the taboos , seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury .
it 's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen , and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent .
just south of the sahara we find the sahel .
in our accelerated media culture , desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines .
and it is largely an issue that we 've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources .
so , they moved the entire village , hut by hut .
this is where the village used to be .
now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they wo n't get chopped down .
it adds roughness to the dune 's surface , to the texture of the dune 's surface , binding the grains .
we can start harvesting condensation , and start greening the desert from within .
i learned about this from a professor at u.c . davis called jason dejong .
so , how much would this cost ?
and , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you 'll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars .
if nothing else , i would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion .
the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why .
why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?
that 's peter ? ( audience : peter . ) ms : all right .
that 's all right .
let 's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
it had to do with golf .
he had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course .
yes , all right .
charlie : it does n't matter ; it 's not part of the game .
warren : i am not a golfer .
it 's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority 's opinion .
he said it 's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .
and how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?
and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no , procreation is not the only purpose of marriage ; what about a lifelong , mutual , loving commitment ?
so with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , aristotle has a point .
and so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we 've created of the course — it 's available now , online , free for everyone anywhere in the world — and to see whether we can partner with institutions , at universities in china , in india , in africa , around the world , to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate .
would n't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in beijing and mumbai and in cambridge , massachusetts and create a global classroom .
that 's what i would love to do .
( laughter ) i have my file which is called to do . i have my plans .
this was an exhibition at the museum of modern art .
i call myself a maker of things .
that means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of man .
the playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer .
i was incredibly curious to see the world , and i made all these things , which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures .
and finally , i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully , that i had behaved morally , and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers , rail-diggers , oven-setters , chimney sweeps and potters .
and i visited it with several ladies , and asked all sorts of questions of the director .
so as a journeyman , i put an ad into the paper that i had studied , that i was a down-to-earth potter 's journeyman and i was looking for a job as a journeyman .
and i got several answers , and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , i thought , halfway to america .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so i will try speed it up a little ( laughter ) moderator : eva , we have about five minutes . ( laughter )
ez : oh , this summer , in fact , the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company , invited me .
and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer , in july , to make some dishes , design some dishes .
so that 's the first big problem .
existential risk is a threat to human survival , or to the long-term potential of our species .
but there have been four studies — one by john lesley , wrote a book on this .
now , if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point — not very much — so that 's equivalent to 60 million lives saved , if we just count the currently living people , the current generation .
and even if you just look at the current people , and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct , it should still have a high priority .
or when you understood something you had never done before .
every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best .
not just the world around us , but we , ourselves .
so if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read , you 're actually , literally rewriting your own brain .
so let 's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement .
part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people — they 're positional goods .
we 're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it .
all of these would enable , in principle — be amenable to enhancement .
and they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard — because of people making stupid movements , and they would be really irritated and would n't see what we were up to .
greater subjective well-being .
this is the last picture that i want to — now we 've got to use the laser pointer .
okay , all right , great . thanks .
lp : who 's ted ?
dh : i 've got to prepare .
dh : right now ?
the spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip .
transferred to a larger scale — actually a lot larger , with a lot of help — 14,064 bicycle reflectors — a 20-day install .
have you ever seen those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky ?
and for me , the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave .
let me show you one more .
`` rm : the `` '' double raindrop '' '' i worked on for nine months , and when i finally turned it on , i actually hated it . ''
and studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report .
instead , the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape .
we rode camels in northern africa and mushed on dog sleds near the north pole .
in august of 2012 , i led my first expedition , taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of greenland .
she and i were in the early stages of planning , as we had intended to go together , when she fell victim to a brain tumor .
my mother 's passion for the arctic echoed through my experience in greenland , and i felt the power and the fragility of the landscape .
yet , while the grandeur of the ice is evident , so , too , is its vulnerability .
( applause )
the tradition and grand narrative of braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions .
fourth generation in a lineage of women , i was raised under the protection and care of grandma ruby , off 8th street at 805 washington avenue .
through reclamation of our narrative , we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality .
and it 's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .
i became a speechwriter for the british foreign secretary .
and it 's a great cadre of people , incredibly close-knit community of people .
and the pinnacle of my career , as it turned out , was when i was posted to new york .
but anyway , i gave that testimony , and that presented me with a crisis .
and so i was in crisis .
`` i felt — there 's a scene in the al pacino movie `` '' the insider , '' '' which you may know , where he goes back to cbs after they 've let him down over the tobacco guy , and he goes , `` '' you know , i just ca n't do this anymore . something 's broken . '' '' and it was like that for me . i love that movie . ''
but , in a way , i 've got used to the sensation of it .
my pension was in it .
and that riot taught me something , which is n't immediately obvious and it 's kind of a complicated story .
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
the u.n. was established in 1945 .
when i realized this , and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars , and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council were n't actually there , were n't actually invited to give their views to the security council , i thought , this is wrong .
something 's got to be done about this .
you 've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the kosovars to come and tell you what they think .
this will allow you to tell me — you can tell them what you think .
so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought , what can we do about it .
and we will be trying to bring the parties to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u. n. security council , and for the members of the u.n. security council to explain to them what they want .
it 's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body .
but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive .
to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what 's going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
all you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times .
now , we started working on this a while ago at oxford university , and we tried to start very simply .
but , just briefly , the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals — neural networks , in this case — all of which are random at the beginning .
so that was the idea behind this .
( laughter ) now , what you see , by the way , at the top there , are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles .
i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc. , but what we 've done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
now , what i 'm going to do right now , in a moment , is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens .
so , this character now has motor skills in the upper body — nothing in the legs yet , in this particular one .
so that 's what you see here .
what you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter-balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
this is all slow motion , by the way , so we can see what 's going on .
and now from the left — and it falls differently .
( laughter ) and this is what happens . ( laughter )
only , i think it 's quite a big blow again .
so this character is going to be hit by a force , it 's going to realize it 's in the air , and it 's going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing .
it 's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
yes , you can just about see it here .
the second thing is video games .
probably starting with sports games , which are going to become much more interactive .
right now , we do n't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .
thanks .
tr : thanks .
i was the president of kaggle , a community of over 200,000 machine learning practictioners .
`` this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at `` '' jeopardy , '' '' answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one . ''
`` [ `` '' the ancient 'lion of nimrud ' went missing from this city 's national museum in 2003 ( along with a lot of other stuff ) '' '' ] this is also why we are now able to see the first self-driving cars . ''
so important was this that in fact the success was covered in the new york times in a front page article a few weeks later .
my friend says i look like a french anarchist — ( laughter ) but this is still what i see when i look in the mirror in the morning .
it included community advocates who were used to fighting against things , but found the atlanta beltline as something that they could fight for ; developers who saw the opportunity to take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city ; and dozens of nonprofit partners who saw their mission at least partly accomplished by the shared vision .
the first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012 , and it 's already generated over three billion dollars of private-sector investment .
this kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl in the last century , the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles fundamentally changed american life .
but it was a cultural momentum .
so it 's important to not separate the physical construction of the places we live from other things that are happening at that time .
this is urgent .
this should be a call to action , because the answer ca n't be to not improve communities .
we have to ensure that change comes on our terms .
we announced the class on july 29th , and within two weeks , 50,000 people had signed up for it .
benjamin bloom had showed that one-on-one tutoring works best , so that 's what we tried to emulate , like with me and my mom , even though we knew it would be one-on-thousands .
stanford coursera , udacity , mitx and others have more classes coming .
and you 'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students .
( applause )
this actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
it does n't require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
so facial expressions — as i mentioned before in emotional experiences — are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .
and the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain , because every brain is different .
`` evan grant : let 's do `` '' pull . '' '' tan le : okay , so let 's choose `` '' pull . '' '' so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen , and there 's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he 's doing that . ''
so let 's see if evan can actually try and imagine pulling .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
i had zero minutes of exercise yesterday , so my maximum heart rate during exercise was n't calculated .
it tracks your movement through space .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
`` so i created the place samboja lestari , and the idea was , if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left , no one will have an excuse to say , `` '' yeah , but ... '' '' no . everyone should be able to follow this . ''
there was a huge amount of crime .
when i stood there in the grass , it 's hot — not even the sound of insects — just this waving grass .
so how 's this possible ?
but we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that .
the people would become the defenders of that forest .
and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .
it 's an old temple-building technique from japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible .
april .
so these fires are really the first things to work on .
that was why i put it as a single point up there .
this is what it looks like : the people have to tap them twice a day — just a millimeter slice — and the only thing you harvest is sugar water , carbon dioxide , rain fall and a little bit of sunshine .
in principle , you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells .
so , just like nature , we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that , we grow the slower growing , primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light . then , what is just as important : get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours .
you do need to know what you are working with , but it 's that diversity which makes it work .
and in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before .
we plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas , the papayas , all the crops for the local people , but the trees are growing up fast in between as well .
and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced , how many medicines can be kept here .
and finally i made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .
and if we look at the rainfall pattern above samboja lestari , it used to be the driest place , but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there .
so you can actually change the climate .
so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do , because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies .
all the seeds get eaten .
and it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees — you have the shade trees planted in year one , then you underplanted with the sugar palms , and you plant this thorny fence .
like here , in samboja lestari , we divide that ring in groups of 20 families .
( applause )
on january 4 , 1934 , a young man delivered a report to the united states congress that 80 years on , still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today , still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet .
and today i want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries , a different way to define and shape our lives for the next 80 years .
the u.s. economy was plummeting into the great depression and policy makers were struggling to respond .
so what kuznet 's report gave them was reliable data on what the u.s. economy was producing , updated year by year .
and now today , every country produces gdp statistics .
we need a better way to measure our societies , a measure based on the real things that matter to real people .
we 're ready because we 've seen , in the financial crisis of 2008 , how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray .
okay , i 'm going to show you .
and then , just for comparison , just for fun , on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita .
so the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is new zealand .
( applause ) well done ! never been ; must go .
( laughter ) the country with the least social progress , i 'm sorry to say , is chad .
( laughter ) or maybe the year after .
and then here 's senegal — it 's got a higher level of social progress than chad , but the same level of gdp .
so let me take away these countries , and then pop in the regression line .
it 's less than half a plan , because where does brazil want to go on social progress ?
and that 's what the social progress index does : it reframes the debate about development , not just about gdp alone , but inclusive , sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people 's lives .
in the 21st century , we face new challenges : aging , obesity , climate change , and so on .
( laughter ) a little bit of it , i think , is the nicotine , but there 's something much bigger than that .
now the problem is , when you ca n't smoke , if you stand and stare out of the window on your own , you 're an antisocial , friendless idiot .
and reality is n't a particularly good guide to human happiness .
the second dog lapses into complete depression .
but i think there 's another debate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our tax money .
what you call them actually affects how you react to them , viscerally and morally .
for 0.01 percent of this money you could have put wifi on the trains , which would n't have reduced the duration of the journey , but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more .
you have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis , a feasibility study , an roi study and so forth .
but this does not apply the other way around .
an example of a great psychological idea : the single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the london underground per pound spent came when they did n't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains , they put dot matrix display board on the platforms .
i 'm merely saying that when you solve problems , you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle .
it 's an innate thing called goal dilution .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
i propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we did n't even realize were problems at all .
it 's not an unreasonable thing to do . it 's an economically efficient thing to do .
so where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money .
he 's an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna .
that 's pretty good .
analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded .
i 'm so excited , i 'm pouring myself into my lesson plans .
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
maybe he ate something bad for lunch , and then things get really horrible , as his skin rips apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides .
so this stuff is not that hard , right ?
and now all of you understand it .
but if you 've graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before .
you know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness .
it kills me . i 'm not kidding .
now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible .
we have to convince our audience that what we 're talking about matters .
but if a young learner ca n't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this , that will ruin their chances of success .
this needs to stop , and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems , and i beg them , i beseech them to just stop it .
( laughter ) but i thought i needed to lose weight , and when i gained it back , of course i blamed myself .
and for the next three decades , i was on and off various diets .
i 'm sure many of you know the feeling .
you do n't forget how to walk because you 're thinking about what to have for dinner .
now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that 's not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
dr. rudy leibel of columbia university has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
this means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin .
the height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
diets do n't have very much reliability .
and my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
let 's face it : if diets worked , we 'd all be thin already .
( applause )
but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children 's hospital up at stanford in palo alto .
now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease , and that 's true most of the time .
it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
so imagine , if you will , that i 'm stroking your arm with this feather , as i 'm stroking my arm right now .
now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
but the situation , of course , in the human body is far more complicated than that .
who studied some physics in university ?
( laughter ) but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction .
it 's the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning .
it was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident .
well , you know the story .
this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people .
we should , in fact , because without having this possibility of conscious minds , we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity ; we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world .
`` and of course , scott fitzgerald said famously that `` '' he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for . '' '' but he also forgot that without consciousness , he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence . ''
this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate .
i do n't believe that , and i think the situation is changing .
that flow of mental images is mind .
but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room .
we are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images .
we have selves .
now to bring home the point of how close it is — the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience — i 'm going to tell you a personal story .
if i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner , what i get is the following .
so far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images .
it 's the following .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
it is that specific .
so in that green component of the brain stem , if you damage it , and often it happens , what you get is complete paralysis , but your conscious mind is maintained .
and people are , in fact , imprisoned within their own bodies , but they do have a mind .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you .
it 's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem , there are , to make it simple , all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior , different aspects of our body .
and it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe — and i could be wrong , but i do n't think i am — that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings — primordial feelings , by the way .
they 're not there for looks .
only the wealth of our minds is , not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence , and that we have any sense of person .
now there are three levels of self to consider — the proto , the core and the autobiographical .
and everybody 's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
three reasons . first , curiosity .
time for some thermodynamics .
and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator .
one has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
so , we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
brought in a team from the u.k. — there 's a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the u.k. — and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
so , this is the way it works .
it heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
the animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them — using the same structures that they use to run , their legs .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe .
here 's one moving with two middle legs gone .
here 's what they do .
they even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear .
to understand it better , we did a ct scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over 40 percent .
we put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces 800 times their body weight , and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally .
there are nano-engineered designs , which at least have been analyzed theoretically , that show the potential to be very lightweight , very inexpensive , very efficient , and we 'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way .
nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it 's needed .
the world bank projects by 2011 , it will be under 20 million , which is a reduction of 95 percent .
and a lot of people , when they think about the future , think about it linearly .
now this is an interesting chart , and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process — and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes — accelerate .
we always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation .
a personal experience , when i was at mit — computer taking up about the size of this room , less powerful than the computer in your cell phone .
i put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph — by the way , a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth — that 's another exponential .
it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 , two years in the middle ; we 're now doubling it every one year .
every time one paradigm ran out of steam , another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth .
in fact , when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm , it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm .
but by the teen years , the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width , and we wo n't be able to shrink them any more .
we will go into the third dimension and there 's been tremendous progress , just in the last few years , of getting three-dimensional , self-organizing molecular circuits to work .
as we make them smaller and less expensive , the electrons have less distance to travel .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
`` this is due to greater productivity , but the economist says , `` '' but there 's no way you 're going to be able to keep up with that . ''
it will be interesting to see what we do in our olympic trials .
these are 2020-circa scenarios , but they 're not as futuristic as it may sound .
doug hofstadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just is n't great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we 'd never catch up to it .
this is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well — in applying psychoacoustic tests , gets very similar results to human auditory perception .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
they 'll be so small , they 'll be embedded in our clothing , in our environment .
`` `` '' experience beamers , '' '' i call them , will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the internet . ''
and information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives , from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials .
we 'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s , from information , in very inexpensive raw materials , using nano-technology .
thank you very much .
i wanted to give you a current picture of the economy .
but anyway , let 's start with the economy .
a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank , it 's an investment bank ; it has 15 to 20 times .
that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .
( laughter ) here 's some advice from one of the largest investors in the united states .
so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep , and sometimes this creature 's called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes ... whatever you want — you 've just got to say no .
if you 're 60 to 65 you retire on time .
and what 's really important in this stuff is , as we cut , we also have to grow .
we do n't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere .
and that 's where these three trends come together .
so think of it as a radio shack for biology .
so , cells have this cycle .
this got a bit more complicated two years later .
so you take resveratrol and you put it into beer .
`` of course , one of the judges is wandering by , and he goes , `` wow ! cancer-fighting beer ! there is a god . '' ''
and people oohed and ahhed , because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken .
this should not surprise you , right ?
but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth , they do n't regrow , unless , if you 're a lawyer .
( laughter ) we also thought we 'd have this robot to warn us of danger .
these are not the only interesting robots .
the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs .
and as you think of the implications of that , here 's a brief history of the universe .
( applause )
as you all know , the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology .
and our minds have altered , too .
indeed , if you score the people a century ago against modern norms , they would have an average i.q . of 70 .
and this martian was an archaeologist , and they found scores , target scores , that people had used for shooting .
and then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
they would say , look , these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand , how keen their eyesight was , whether they had control of their weapon .
how could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
well we now know , of course , the answer .
if that martian looked at battlefields , they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the civil war and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the spanish-american war , and then they had machine guns by the time of world war i .
you know , i can eat a fish . i ca n't eat a crow .
first , almost all of us today get a high school diploma .
they put it in harrisburg rather than philadelphia .
and so forth .
so the tenor of education has changed .
a whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
it 's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties .
or take an islamic father whose daughter has been raped , and he feels he 's honor-bound to kill her .
well , he 's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited , and they 're unmovable in any way by logic .
you 're treating them as universals , to be rendered consistent by logic .
that is , if you said to them , cats are like wildcats .
what are dogs like ?
they could say a semicircle .
they live in the bubble of the present .
i can switch to different data views .
and this is a pretty well-educated audience , so i imagine you all know something about aids .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .
i 'm not going to tell you about exports and prices .
i think it may seem like i 'm ignoring the policy stuff , which is really the most important , but i 'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually can not develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works .
that is a huge effect .
so we do n't have quite as good data , but you can see here the share of single men having pre-marital sex , or married men having extra-marital sex , and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s , and late '90s to early 2000s . the epidemic is getting worse .
so if you 're a software engineer and you 're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program , it 's important to think about how much it costs .
so malaria is a disease that kills you .
and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .
if you look at the blue line , the areas with low levels of malaria , you can see in those areas , actually , the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as hiv prevalence goes up .
there 's another risk , and they respond less to this existing risk .
if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own , even if they know everything about the disease , they still may not change their behavior .
botswana is a place with a lot of aids , egypt is a place without a lot of aids .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to hiv .
so this is another way to see this .
i 'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that 's going to help us think about the world .
the epidemic was introduced to the us by actually one male steward on an airline flight , who got the disease in africa and brought it back .
and if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was , then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead .
and maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things .
so thank you very much .
and in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since 1790 .
and each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the united states at that time .
and obviously , technology had existed before then , but we were n't aware of it , and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .
if we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today — and i mean everything , from blades to scrapers to cloth — we as a species would not live very long .
we would die by the billions , and very quickly : the wolves would get us , we would be defenseless , we would be unable to grow enough food , or find enough food .
it was a very short life . but at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world , with that very little technology , actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed : three to six hours a day .
because they had banker hours basically .
but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came , then people went into starvation .
and they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until , within several tens of thousands of years , we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species , with a very small amount of technology .
so , it 's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet , and in such a degree that i think that it 's become our — who we are .
your cat wants more food .
at the same time , it wants to give us things , and what it gives us is basically progress .
that 's what progress is about .
and when it diverts from what you want , we prioritize risk , we evaluate not just the new stuff , but the old stuff .
so , our job as humans is to parent our mind children , to find them good friends , to find them a good job .
( laughter ) there are no bad technologies , just as there are no bad children .
we just have to find them the right place .
and we are aware of the price .
even technology wants clean water .
so , technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket .
in 1980 , the year of independence , 25 percent of zimbabwean children were fully immunized .
the excitement , the camaraderie , was palpable .
but i was not talking about structural change .
`` at a 10-year memorial for the genocide , he reflected , `` '' i believed at the time i was doing my best , but i realized after the genocide that there was more i could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support . '' '' the aids epidemic caught the health community unprepared , and today , when the world health organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease , i 'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier . ''
i was there for my technical skills , both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills .
and i did everything i could for each and every patient of mine .
medical anthropologists such as paul farmer , who worked on aids in haiti , call this structural violence : structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world , often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power ; and violence because its impact — premature deaths , suffering , illness — is violent .
and i worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine , looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment , may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture , that it is the daily context , where a person lives , grows , works , loves , that most importantly determines population health , and for too many of us , poor health .
i will speak out against racism , and i hope you will join me , and i will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality .
we just need courage .
i 'd like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
in this contest people have to write and recite original poetry , in the nabati form of poetry , which is the traditional bedouin form .
`` we must go to watch `` '' afghan star . '' '' cynthia schneider : these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society . ''
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
contestants also put themselves forward .
now , of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance , but not entirely .
this has opened up the door , particularly for women .
and for afghanistan , where the taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music .
thank you .
you know , creation is what put that dog in that picture , and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .
you know , when i was a teenager , i was a creator .
then i became an adult and started knowing who i was , and tried to maintain that persona — i became creative .
and another point — why i 'm here — is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy , i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life , picked the thing — did n't have any friends .
and that 's how — with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in 1983 , and that 's very — the basic reason i 'm talking to you here today : because i got shot . ( laughter ) ( applause ) well , when i started working with my own work , i decided that i should n't do images .
the first works were actually objects .
they were displayed first at stux gallery in 1983 .
the rocking podium . ( laughter ) this is the pre-columbian coffeemaker . ( laughter ) actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks , that i insisted that i was n't having colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-columbian .
the entire encyclopedia britannica bound in a single volume , for travel purposes .
because clouds can mean anything you want .
but i was still , you know — this is a kitty cloud .
`` `` jacynthe . '' ''
because i was doing this while i was making these pictures , i realized that i could add still another thing i was trying to make a subject — something that would interfere with the themes , so chocolate is very good , because it has — it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance .
`` `` paparazzi . '' ''
and i felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself .
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
and in this , you 'd have like a — something that looks like a cloud , and it is a cloud at the same time .
my time is nearly up .
i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth .
i am not a breast cancer survivor .
her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
the radiologists were , in turn , criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest .
breast density refers to the relative amount of fat — pictured here in yellow — versus connective and epithelial tissues — pictured in pink .
radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram .
and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
now it 's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer , but it turns out that it 's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer .
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 .
in a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars , digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography , and in fact , it was worse in older women .
ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies , so it 's not widely used .
malcolm gladwell wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation , and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual 's genius .
now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart , and it had even been tried to image the breast .
but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he 'd seen , and this is it .
it 's made not of a bulky tube , but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector .
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape — ( laughter ) — michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out , and we attached the new detector , and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging , or mbi .
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .
( applause ) we still need to complete the screening study using the low dose , and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
so until something is available for women with dense breasts , there are things that you should know to protect yourself .
and if you do n't know , please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report .
but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography 's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation .
we need to individualize screening based on density .
and while i was there , i came across what i think is the most brilliant of their programs .
so feed 's doing great . we 've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world by selling now 550,000 bags , a ton of bags , a lot of bags .
there 's definitely hunger in america : 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children .
the numbers are pretty crazy .
there 's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry .
i think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
and in one generation , they 're going from hunger , and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger , to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation .
the icons like michael pollan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different , and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world , but if we take a 30-year view , there 's more hope in collaborative ideas .
she wears it every day .
`` ( laughter ) and he could say , `` '' oh my god ! '' '' or `` '' i heart you ! '' '' `` i 'm laughing out loud . '' ''
i think my heartbeat might be the morse code for inappropriate .
i 'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes — for swearing , awkward silences , and very simple rhyme schemes .
he was talking about the space aliens .
( laughter ) now , i am not a scientist .
`` `` '' oh , '' '' he said , `` little green men . '' ''
it was as though time had stopped .
now , you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding — a strange encounter among humans .
maybe it was swamp gas , but — ( laughter ) — i know what i saw .
on my right was the girl in question .
she was very tall , i would say .
he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world .
( laughter ) and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her .
i sure am glad i never saw her again .
`` and he also described the phenomenon known in this community as `` '' lost time , '' '' where whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes , or the previous ten hours , or the previous ten days . ''
what ? did we do this ? really ? does anyone do this ?
we went to some topless beaches .
now , faro is a bustling little city , and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take a bus and then a boat .
it was at that moment , in that very small town of 30,000 or so , that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it .
`` an event like this leaves a scar on the memory , much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a `` '' portuguese doctor . '' '' ( laughter ) and even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , i look for her still , whenever she is not in the room . ''
and even though , i think you 'll agree , it is probable that during the time she was away , she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone , i love her and wait for her still .
[ is it ethical to evolve the human body ? ] because we 're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves .
so the wonderful aimee mullins will go out and say , how tall do i want to be tonight ?
and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor .
but the octopus did .
`` if you walked up to an octopus tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arrived , the octopus would rise up and look at you and you 're thinking , `` '' is that guy really looking at me ? he is looking at me ! '' '' and you walk up to the front of the tank . then you realize that these animals all have different personalities : some of them would hold their ground , others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks , and one in particular , this amazing animal ... ''
then he lifts another arm and i lift another arm .
`` and i remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , `` '' wait a minute . ''
it 's been a good ride .
down you go . there 's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio .
but we 're just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which i think is even more extraordinary .
and it forms these towers , these chimneys that are 10 , 20 , 30 feet tall .
and it completely threw science on its head .
and before the discovery of these vents , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis .
and there 's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .
i 've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay .
five years later , come back , and that same bay is now gorgeous . it 's beautiful .
and that i do .
how do you ensure technology reaches users ?
and i took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users , and not just any users , but customers who live on less than four dollars a day .
and while you have affordability , you 've lost on functionality .
it needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market .
we see that they squat . they kneel in prayer .
and at d-rev , we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed .
so do you see that black strip right there ?
they 're not donated . they 're not heavily subsidized .
it also has to be designed to be very affordable .
this is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
so let 's start with some good news , and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases ?
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 40s .
and one in particular that you probably would n't know about , stroke , which has been , along with heart disease , one of the biggest killers in this country , is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset , some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever .
you 're probably thinking that does n't make any sense .
now , i started by telling you that there were some good-news stories .
i work for the federal government .
and maybe at this point , when you know what i do , or maybe what i 've failed to do , you 'll think that i probably ought to be fired , and i could certainly understand that .
what i 've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders , diseases of the mind .
we 're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we 're going to hear about drugs or we 're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules , or maybe into some sort of very flat , unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia .
now i was thinking , how can i make those sound waves visible ?
i took a speaker , i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles .
ah , some of you have . excellent .
it 's a liquid that is completely black .
so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field , it would change its appearance .
now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet .
now this looks already quite interesting , but let me now add some watercolors to it .
and it was with those two properties that i was able to create the images that you 're seeing right now .
let me demonstrate this over here .
and what i have here is an empty glass vessel .
and now i 'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey .
so , i have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?
is it just some strange materials ?
we have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods , and for me the abaya , my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today .
we 're continuously trying to straddle different worlds , different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others .
ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby 's and christie 's .
we want to build our own identities , our own fabric , create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us .
( video ) boy : hey listen ! did you know that the stocks are up ?
khaled : why would i want to put it on ?
useless .
now , have any of y'all ever looked up this word ?
here , i 'll show it to you .
`` lexicographical has this great pattern : it 's called a double dactyl . and just by saying double dactyl , i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red . ( laughter ) ( applause ) but `` '' lexicographical '' '' is the same pattern as `` '' higgledy-piggledy . '' '' right ? it 's a fun word to say , and i get to say it a lot . ''
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it 's funny .
when a guy who looks like that , in that hat , is the face of modernity , you have a problem .
computers ! what about computers ?
you know , we have victorian design with an engine on it . that 's all !
online dictionaries must be different .
woman 's making a ham for a big , family dinner .
you know , that ham butt is delicious ! there 's no reason to throw it away .
`` now they 're going to think `` '' oh , boy . ''
and i think this is a problem .
there 's a lot going on there .
`` one of them is just labeled `` '' miscellaneous technical senses . '' '' do you know what that says to me ? ''
and the thing is , we could ask for help — asking for help 's not that hard .
we just do n't know enough , and we do n't even know that we 're missing california .
so , enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help , and they 're doing a good job of it .
i do n't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon .
if we can find comets without a telescope , should n't we be able to find words ?
and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography . is n't that great ?
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough .
if you do n't know the provenance or the source of the artifact , it 's not science , it 's a pretty thing to look at .
you see , what i 'm really hoping for is that my son , who turns seven this month — i want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in .
if we can do that , then i can spend all my time fishing , and i do n't have to be a traffic cop anymore .
and so i 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today .
i 'm going to talk about a program i started there , which , from my point of view , is the proudest thing i did .
that 's just because , in the nature of the national portrait gallery , it 's created to look at american lives .
and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .
that 's barbara walters and others like that , and we like that .
i did n't know it coming into it .
and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young .
and so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
so , you know , you want energy , you want the life force , but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing .
there 's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them .
the worst interview i ever did : william l. shirer .
`` the journalist who did `` '' the rise and fall of the third reich . '' '' this guy had met hitler and gandhi within six months , and every time i 'd ask him about it , he 'd say , `` '' oh , i just happened to be there . ''
this was n't — and some of you will remember mike wallace 's old interviews — tough , aggressive and so forth . they have their place .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
`` she did an extraordinary play called `` '' the women . '' '' she was a congresswoman when there were n't very many congresswomen . ''
and she stonewalled me . it was unbelievable .
and i began to wonder what was going on , and you think while you talk , and basically , i thought , i got it .
i 'm not politically attracted to her , but through her life force , i 'm attracted to her .
and she was in horrible pain .
and secondly , she had better be , although she did dance for a while , a choreographer because then her looks did n't matter .
my journey to this stage began when i came to america at the age of 17 .
i came because i wanted to study english literature .
so i started a career as a social entrepreneur , starting an organization for young people like myself — i was young at the time that i started it — who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent .
voters elected michael bloomberg mayor of new york city .
we also adopted by ballot referendum the office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york .
and it 's these three things — immigrants ' votes , voices and vantage points — that i think can help make our democracy stronger .
well , let 's talk first about votes .
they matter in local and state elections .
and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table , they can make a difference .
she is a first-generation college student .
she grew up partly in colima , mexico , and partly in yakima , washington .
and she 's a role model for her daughter and other latinas .
we have come for economic and educational opportunity .
we have come in the pursuit of love .
and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point , that the bridge that t. boone pickens talked about will get us to .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
so maybe i do n't want to admit to that .
i wanted to be a biker chick .
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
beyond this hand is a world of vaseline .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
but more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that i could .
and it 's extraordinary how far belief can take you .
i always end up in the gents ' toilets .
and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you 're not , or to be somebody that you are n't ?
`` and then he said to me , `` '' what did you want to be when you were little ? '' '' now listen , i was n't going to say to him , `` '' well , i wanted to race cars and motorbikes . '' '' hardly appropriate at this moment in time . ''
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and now i had lost it . and now i really could n't see .
and it did happen this way .
and nobody can tell me no .
but you ca n't tell me , no , i ca n't be mowgli , because guess what ?
and so i got off that rock , and , oh my god , did i run home .
i did n't speak hindi . i 'd never been to india . had n't a clue .
but you know , i was believing in the wrong thing .
when i came home off that elephant , do you know what the most amazing part was ?
being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
we all have to be included .
losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .
these are normal cells .
and in fact , right now in many states , you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets .
so in the lower right here , you have dolly , the first cloned sheep — now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh ; ralph the rat , the first cloned rat ; cc the cat , for cloned cat ; snuppy , the first cloned dog — snuppy for seoul national university puppy — created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not .
the guar is an endangered southeast asian ungulate .
they ca n't actually make them land .
this is the ratbot , or the robo-rat by sanjiv talwar at suny downstate .
`` we 've taken away the autonomy of this animal . '' '' i 'll get back to that in a minute . ''
he took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons — so these are just individual neurons from rats — put them on a chip .
they self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
this is where we are in this process .
`` and so , asks the economist : `` the first artificial organism and its consequences . '' ''
this is a dna synthesizer , and here at the bottom are just bottles of a , t , c and g — the four chemicals that make up our dna chain .
and so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
and then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?
( applause )
a hundred years on , we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics , but what 's at stake now is rather different .
but when we look around us , we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff , full of stars , planets , trees , squirrels .
if it was n't there , those particles would have no mass , and no atoms could form and there would be no us .
theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number , and they 've come up with a number of possible explanations .
that 's one with 120 zeroes after it .
but unlike the higgs field , this number has no known explanation .
now , critics say this makes string theory unscientific .
what if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse ?
the stakes now could not be higher .
so you have to rely on people 's ingenuity , that they will solve the problems , but it may be a decade or more down the line .
( applause )
and i remember , that was a game i used to play with myself to entertain myself whenever i was bored or frustrated . ( laughter )
and i resented this , because not only do i not remember signing up to that , but i resent the fact that they appear to think that i should be excited about a shop opening .
it 's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life , without having emails about supermarket chains and candy crush saga .
`` and i said , `` '' what 's the plan , dan ? ''
`` i said , `` '' i 'm just tremendously excited about the opening ! '' '' ( laughter ) `` do you want to book the bouncy castle or shall i ? '' ''
`` he said , `` '' mr. veitch , i 'm not responsible for anything you have ordered . '' '' i said , `` '' let 's not get into who did what . ''
( applause ) it gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know that these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another for eternity .
if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes , you might dismiss them as poor and simple .
these women are descendants of polynesian navigators , trained in the old ways by their elders , and now they 're passing it on to me .
it will sometimes be a lonely road .
it 's the home of my mentor .
his name is pius mau piailug .
he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world .
even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy .
it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old .
the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance .
once upon a time , at the age of 24 , i was a student at st. john 's medical college in bangalore .
and that changed my mindset forever .
and i do n't mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. — that 's a piece of cake , with one billion people .
i will start at 1858 .
it meant paying with opium for chinese goods .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in tokyo harbor over the last year .
and let 's see how much difference that can make .
but careful now — we are approaching the first world war .
and then after the first world war , they continue up .
in 1947 india finally gained its independence .
and it 's healthier than the united states .
uttar pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of india .
and here , maharashtra , with mumbai , is forging forward .
no , there is one more inequity . look there , united states .
washington , d.c. went out here .
and i can understand him , because washington , d.c .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now here we have the whole world . you have the legend down there .
`` and when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which thomas friedman so correctly called the `` '' flat world . '' '' you can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in africa , and other parts , as in rural guizhou in china , there is still people with low health and very low economy . ''
`` now , the question is , `` '' when will the catch up take place ? '' '' look at , look at the united states . ''
they seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
you see , japan did it like that .
we add japan to it .
you know the climate . we have great international experts within india telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise china and india would be the countries most to suffer from climate change .
and i consider india and china the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy .
( applause ) the 27th of july , 2048 is my 100th birthday .
some people nodding yes .
where did this guy get this confidence , the audacity of it ?
so when i asked him , he told me three things .
and just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip , okay , trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at sacred heart cathedral in room 206 .
( explosion ) all right . sorry .
on the right we have little emmalou — southern family .
i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything .
we 've heard about these starting with the revelations from june 6 .
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell , well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist .
we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
we did not know about skywriter — all these different programs run by u.s. intelligence agencies .
but now we do .
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
they all say that this simply is n't true , that they are not giving backdoor access to their data .
they probably have a team building on thursday evening in a pub .
yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders , to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil , to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e.u . parliament , and i do n't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e.u . parliament , right ?
so we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the internet , we should think about americans as our masters .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so , what is there to be done ?
should we worry . no , we should n't worry .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it 's rude , and it should not be done .
maybe you can do it together with other countries .
and to quote a fellow security researcher , haroon meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state .
i have a daughter , mulan .
`` and i go , `` '' oh , it 's the same . it 's basically the same . '' '' and then she got all caught up in the legs . `` `` but how would the legs go , mom ? ''
he could not move his body , but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball .
and as this message gave feedback back to the brain , the brain realized its goal : to make us move .
however , your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head .
it is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient 's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him , but it is he who is walking again .
`` so he walks , and at the end of the walk — i am running out of time already — he says , `` '' you know , guys , i need to borrow this thing from you when i get married , because i wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself . ''
basically , the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go .
but it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y , the other monkey to control y and z , and the third one to control x and z , and you make them all play the game together , moving the arm in 3d into a target to get the famous brazilian orange juice .
( laughter ) we are paid to be children , to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there .
thank you .
it 's simply impossible .
and he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the internet across continents .
miguel nicolelis , thank you . mn : thank you , bruno . thank you .
it 's something we all go through , and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody .
so i was very happy .
here 's a painting from back around that time .
bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment .
do n't do that .
she made beautiful pottery .
but i , too , wanted to do everything i could to help , so i wanted to try everything .
it was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis .
my brothers , sister , and father and i all came together in this supportive and attentive way .
this was the most important thing .
and here 's what happened .
it 's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me .
i actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight next to a light in the woods .
i 'm going outside instead of inside .
i could feel my deepest intention , what matters most to me , that human connection that can happen in a space where there 's no resisting or controlling .
thank you .
illegal wildlife trade in brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna , especially birds , and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month , and transported far from their origins , to be sold mainly in rio de janeiro and são paulo .
and for us to understand what happens with them , we 're going to follow brad .
`` the good guys arrived , took the cute , mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers , and everyone lived happily ever after . '' '' but did they ? actually , no , and this is where many of our problems begin . ''
the brazil ornithological society — so now we 're talking only birds — claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .
we believe we have performed responsible releases .
this is the core mystical moment of islam , and as such , of course , it defies empirical analysis .
in his own reported words , he was convinced at first that what had happened could n't have been real .
at best , he thought , it had to have been a hallucination — a trick of the eye or the ear , perhaps , or his own mind working against him .
`` this might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word `` '' awesome '' '' to describe a new app or a viral video . ''
with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake , we 're protected from real awe .
they insist that he never doubted for even a single moment , let alone despaired .
he 'd say what the koran says : anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity .
i 'm not quite sure how , but it turned up in my inbox , and it was from a guy called solomon odonkoh .
or i could do what i think we 've all always wanted to do .
i was in sainsbury 's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties .
`` kitkat . '' '' ( laughter ) because you have to be consistent . ''
then i did get an email back from him .
and this looks fairly legitimate , this is a letter of authorization .
little did i know , lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that i 'd been born at the right place and the right time , that i was in a country where i could participate in the technological revolution .
in fact , i think they 're putting up my grade six report .
( laughter ) i was pretty good in reading , but religion and musical appreciation needed more work . ( laughter )
one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
`` ( applause ) i saw my first apple computer in 1984 , and i thought to myself , `` this thing 's got a glass screen , not much use to me . '' ''
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
that 's what it 's shrunk to .
ted was a motorcycle racer , but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight , which is devastating if you 're trying to ride motorbikes .
it 's called jaws , job access with speech , and it sounds like this .
but , you know , i find reading with machines a very lonely process .
i grew up with family , friends , reading to me , and i loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading .
but i would n't give up the technology , because it 's allowed me to lead a great life .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating , a cross-border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception , we can transport those books across borders and give life to people , particularly in developing countries , blind people who do n't have the books to read .
the young man 's name was evariste galois .
and he wrote to the academicians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world .
and it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well .
`` it is written in mathematical language , and the letters are triangles , circles and other geometric figures , without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word . '' '' but it 's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry . ''
`` here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in `` '' the magic mountain . '' '' he has a character describing the snowflake , and he says he `` '' shuddered at its perfect precision , found it deathly , the very marrow of death . '' '' but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them . ''
recently i took my family — we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips , which my family love .
can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i do something , put it back down again .
so i 'm going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematically — so brace yourselves — push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is symmetry .
it seems mad to talk about nothing .
for example , what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn , and then a third of a turn ?
so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work .
the combined effect , the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
and they 'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle , or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish .
what about the center of a triangle ? i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle , and everything matches up .
now , let 's move to the very different-looking wall in the alhambra .
and although these walls look very different , galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same .
so , like galois , i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you , and i 've got a picture of it here .
and this thing — species die away , and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode — but this mathematical object will live forever .
how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have ?
great . excellent . that should get us going . all right .
because this one . i think there were a few here .
you are now immortal .
now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones .
this is some of the field work that we 've done .
we have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
it was right around new years .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
the first boomer actually , we did n't even wait till 2011 , next year .
with my own healthcare problems , i 've taken drug therapies , i 've traveled to this hospital and others , many , many times .
and this is mainframe healthcare .
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
this is a very reactive , crisis-driven system .
we collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting , and we fix them up , like humpty-dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope — we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website — that they do as asked and do n't come back into the mainframe .
i have access to senators and ceos .
these are two different subjects in our study .
so , you know , that 's my last message to you .
it 's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all , but it 's going to be part of the solution .
its species name is sequoia sempervirens .
i 'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism .
now , let your imagination go upward into space .
i became very interested , and i wrote about a couple .
neither one of them had noticed that there was a yellow jacket wasp 's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that steve had jumped into .
he would have fallen to his death , being 75 feet above the ground .
but they made it to the top , and what they found was not a redwood desert , but a lost world — a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air , filled with unknown life .
it 's like scuba diving into a coral reef , except you 're going upward instead of downward .
maria 's sitting on one of them .
redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration .
a redwood is a fractal . and as they put out limbs , the limbs burst into small trees , copies of the redwood .
there 's the person , right there . the person is waving to us .
and this hallucinatory drawing shows you — everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar .
they 're finding out that redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks , possibly all the way into their root systems .
the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the mississippi river .
( applause ) chris anderson : i think at a previous ted , i think it was nathan myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like , 2,000 years and older , on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the earth except on that one tree . is that correct ?
and i was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it , in 2006 .
ca : so , you have to wonder when , you know , if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth , you know , our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip .
you 've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that 's happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
but lately , the doors of the palace have been flung open , and the walls are coming down .
the first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly , literally .
the hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it , as is routinely done for breast cancer , for example .
the devices are also biodegradable .
my personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14 .
and in 2001 , there was no tumblr , there was no facebook , there was no pinterest .
and we do teach our kids how the human body works , we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one .
`` but when the kid comes to us and asks , `` so , what is a bubble sort algorithm ? '' ''
`` `` '' it 's too complicated , '' '' the others say . ''
well , it 's neither .
and even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together .
and you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad .
`` but you kids , you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer . '' '' and then i had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said , `` '' this bicycle lamp , if it were a computer , it would change colors . '' '' and i said , `` '' that 's a really good idea , what else could it do ? '' '' and she thinks and she thinks , and she goes , `` '' if this bicycle lamp were a computer , we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent ''
instead of stories , i do them with code .
( applause )
so i ask you : who are you going to pick ?
a series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency , lack of focus , unpredictability .
one-third .
one of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the chinese cultural revolution in 1966 .
but instead of accepting his fate , he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education .
scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself .
people who overcome adversity do n't do it alone .
it was the world 's first popular computer .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
the ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle .
so let 's go to step one .
he would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
and it would take a full university course to illustrate it .
what i want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design .
but if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ?
you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot , and you can remove its foot .
without a foot , here 's what it does . it does n't even slow down .
it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it ca n't be seen .
watch where the robot , now , contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain .
you can see it here well on this debris .
now , you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .
and my assistant 's going to help me here .
boy : spiny .
rf : so if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
we found that they 're for something else — here 's a segment of that spine .
they 're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris , but they 're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface .
but of course , we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines .
watch the leg come around , and you 'll see it grab on right there .
one of the ones i 'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that 's a smooth metal plate .
ca : i did .
these are all from different insects .
here from underneath is an ant foot , and when the claws do n't dig in , that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything .
it just extrudes .
now we have something better here .
it has a hundred to a thousand split ends , and that 's the secret , because it allows intimate contact .
there 's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields .
it 's aerated , it can be peeled off easily , it does n't cause any irritation , it works underwater .
mark cutkosky , though , is taking it a step further .
it 's not the whole robot yet , we 're working on it — now you can see how it 's attaching .
it 's a very challenging task . but more to come later .
and third , we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology , and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make — potentially — something better than nature .
find those three things and get yourself on the ground , chances are good that you will find fossils .
now , were it quite that easy , geologists would rejoice .
most pages are destroyed soon after being written .
the library is vast and magnificent — but decrepit .
and it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently .
nature provided no card catalog for geologists — this would have to be invented .
and you have to get yourself in a desert .
now , unfortunately , that bone was isolated .
we dug and dug and dug , and there was n't another bone around .
but it made us hungry to go back the next year for more .
and on the first day of that next field season , i found this : another two-meter femur , only this time not isolated , this time associated with 145 other bones of a giant plant eater .
and that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism .
dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation , taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few .
meanwhile , earth history unfolded above .
and standing there , alone in the desert , it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small .
but over geological time , improbable , nearly impossible events do occur .
i once stood at the head of the missouri river and bestraddled it .
now go down to the mouth of the missouri , near st. louis , and it 's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal .
dinosaurs like dreadnoughtus were real .
sea monsters like the mosasaur were real .
and now we 've evolved to the point where we ca n't survive without clothing .
and it 's more than just utility , now it 's a communication .
i made a lot of my own toys .
they helped — ( laughter ) it was the armor .
`` the armor in `` '' excalibur '' '' was intoxicatingly beautiful to me . ''
`` i want to wear armor all the time ! '' '' ( laughter ) so i went back to my favorite material , the gateway drug for making , corrugated cardboard , and i made myself a suit of armor , replete with the neck shields and a white horse . ''
`` and then we do an episode called `` '' dumpster diving , '' '' and i learn a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me . ''
( laughter ) the episode was going to have two distinct parts to it .
i feel total embarrassment over the fact that it 's so nakedly clear to my crew that i 'm completely into wearing this costume .
( laughter ) not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor , but also with the community of other costumers .
ah , ah ah ! — like that .
i can see through the mouth — i can see people 's shoes .
`` in the film `` '' spirited away , '' '' bad luck befalls those who take gold from no-face . ''
we 're connecting with something important inside of us .
thank you .
do n't get me wrong : it 's not like we do n't have comedy in the middle east .
working in london as tv maker and writer , i quickly realized that comedy connects audiences .
it 's still going strong , with positive press to die for .
my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience .
who had started a successful new tribe .
first , we 'd need to buy content from the west and air it .
`` i excitedly presented this to the big boss , and his reaction was , `` '' um , i do n't get it . '' '' so i retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub . ''
now , were the axis successful ?
in jordan , we had his majesty the king come and see them .
in dubai this year , we 've just had the first all-women 's , homegrown stand-up show .
and notice two of them are wearing headscarves , and yes , even they can laugh .
and the lebanese , brilliant lebanese , nemr abou nassar , we featured in our first tour , has just been performing in l.a. 's legendary comedy clubs .
sadly , this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bombers , billionaires and belly dancers .
we have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
and we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know , and for even more that you 've never heard of .
i am not a religious person myself , but i did look for nature .
so i looked for furniture .
it includes 330 compasses .
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .
many of you will know this tedster , danny gilbert , whose book , actually , i got it through the ted book club .
i think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical .
his restaurant is open seven months every year .
his latest numbers are fairly impressive .
and he has 2.2 million requests for reservations .
so i 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
i had thought that i should do this without any plan , that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation . it was not .
and that actually , specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical , worked really well for me .
what came out of it ?
i really got close to design again .
and i 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
you put any image in there , like that beethoven image .
the truck they go on tour with .
my parents are both salespeople .
`` i showed some of it at earlier teds before , under the title `` '' things i 've learned in my life so far . '' '' i 'll just show two now . ''
that 's the police , getting rid of it all .
they were n't quite slick enough .
and i think she overdid it .
video : ( laughter ) and i 'm happy i 'm alive .
i’d like to dedicate this next song to carmelo , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .
but apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed .
and i believe there is .
so the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy , in principle : you give everybody their own keys , and then you make sure the server does n't actually have the keys .
and if you think about it , the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy .
what we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible .
so here we have bob and alice , who want to communicate privately .
`` once his account is created , he just clicks `` '' compose , '' '' and now he can write his email like he does today . ''
earlier this year , protonmail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources , and when this happened , our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars .
so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal .
so now 's the time for us to collectively stand up and say , yes , we do want to live in a world with online privacy , and yes , we can work together to turn this vision into a reality .
thank you .
in fact , it was beginning , and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment , apology and atonement .
the actual events are pretty straightforward .
my friend rushed me to the hospital .
i blamed everybody from my parents to the system .
i rationalized my decision to shoot because in the hood where i come from , it 's better to be the shooter than the person getting shot .
`` i had in fact become what the warden of the michigan reformatory called `` the worst of the worst . '' ''
now as i see it , solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself , but find myself i did .
and anytime i would get a letter from my son , it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine .
it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer .
one of the things i realized , which was part of the transformation , was that there were four key things .
i also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two-year-old son sekou , and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way .
the final thing was writing .
it was the first time in my life that i ever felt open to forgiving myself .
in 2010 , i walked out of prison for the first time after two decades .
`` for the first time , i was exposed to the internet , social media , cars that talk like kitt from `` '' knight rider . '' '' but the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology . ''
i had to apologize to the people i had hurt .
but i also had to apologize to myself .
thank you .
engineering at the molecular level , working at the smallest of scales , can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer .
the genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival , allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments .
( laughter ) but there is one more big obstacle we have to think about .
and guess what ? our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object .
first , this outer layer is one of the naturally charged , highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body .
it acts for hours , giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes .
i was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support .
it 's not just about building really elegant science .
thank you .
i am not ready for a driverless airplane .
how about a driverless world ?
right ? whether it 's the world trade organization or it 's the imf , the world bank , the bretton woods accord on currency , these were american institutions , our values , our friends , our allies , our money , our standards .
they look like they 're about to get into a cage match , right ?
they want their own preferences and order .
europe went right up to russia , went right down to the middle east , and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more americanized , that would be less of a problem , but in a g-zero world , those countries nearest russia and nearest the middle east actually have different economic capabilities , different social stability and different political preferences and systems than core europe .
we will see it in brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there .
there you could actually see a slip away from the united states over the coming years .
those countries can fall off the map .
another global financial crisis could do this .
`` and in fact , we know that that 's true , because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study , and when they submitted it to the exact same journal , the journal said , `` '' no , we 're not interested in publishing replication . we 're not interested in your negative data . '' '' so this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted . ''
these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
that would mean that i was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it . ( laughter ) but this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we 've stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
the results were unavailable to them .
we wo n't publish any journals , we wo n't publish any trials , unless they 've been registered before they began .
but they did n't hold the line . in 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the icmje were n't properly registered , and a quarter of them were n't registered at all .
and then finally , the fda amendment act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year .
but the other twin , callum , appeared to be healthy , as far as the doctor could tell , and these twins were identical , genetically identical .
and it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months .
and just like the doctor said , thomas was missing the top part of his skull , but he could nurse , drink from a bottle , cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby , and he slept in our arms .
so to be able to participate in your study gives thomas 's life a new layer of meaning .
after this , we went to the conference room and we relaxed and we had lunch together , and the lab staff presented callum with a birthday gift .
and we met amazing people doing inspiring work .
and they need him in order to do their job .
i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
because the original routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with , which had this open platform at the back — in fact , i think all our routemasters are here in california now actually .
and openings seemed — everyone loves opening bridges , but it 's quite a basic thing .
and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just could n't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken .
and so this is in paddington in london .
it 's just steel and timber .
( laughter ) and so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station , our condition was that we would work with them and that , whatever we did , we were not just going to decorate a normal power station .
and there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station .
and 250 countries all competing .
so we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
but this phenomenal project 's been happening .
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .
this is the only project that we 've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .
( laughter ) a key thing was how people would interact .
so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .
and by linking these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest , instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings .
th : these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure .
basically , i use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash .
( beatboxing ) and now , for my next number , i 'd like to return to the classics .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
or maybe you 've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork .
and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we 're born , while we 're still in the womb .
from the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it — its mother .
babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they 're out in the world .
`` babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as `` '' yuck . '' '' what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat . ''
fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they 'll be joining through one of culture 's most powerful expressions , which is food .
much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life — the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she 's exposed to , even the emotions she feels — are shared in some fashion with her fetus .
they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself .
will it live a long , fruitful life or a short , harried one ?
the pregnant woman 's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .
the resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus ' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility , our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments , from the country to the city , from the tundra to the desert .
but there was another population that was affected — the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege .
these individuals ' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways .
the meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story , a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation .
but there 's another way of thinking about ptsd .
it 's about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation .
( applause )
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
the first gentleman , he 's a baker .
and so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning .
and i 've heard this story a number of times .
they 've lived in italy for a number of years .
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
this only started about 150 years ago .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and if you think , it 's permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
the pew institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that — and i think that this number is conservative — 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
the point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
let 's start from democracy .
well , i first began to understand this when i was 14 years old .
( laughter ) so in 1967 , elections were coming , things were going well in the campaign , the house was electric .
we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece .
my father , hiding nearby , reveals himself , and was summarily taken to prison .
but the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing , and i had been elected on a mandate , a mission , actually , to tackle these problems , whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance , or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful — tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system , politics and media captured by special interests .
`` negotiations are difficult , the tensions are high , progress is slow , and then , 10 minutes to 2 , a prime minister shouts out , `` we have to finish in 10 minutes . '' ''
and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens , of our peoples , even more in the democratic process .
`` there will be havoc in the markets again . '' '' i said , `` '' we need to , before we restore confidence in the markets , we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people . '' '' since leaving office , i have had time to reflect . ''
above government , above markets was the direct rule of the people .
so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora ?
so let 's see if it ca n't be an experiment in global democracy , a new kind of democracy .
and here 's an idea : why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants , not greek or german or swedish citizenship , but a european citizenship ?
and make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe .
now , some might accuse me of being naive , putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people .
everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas , whether it 's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally , where everybody lives , everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality , everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy , dogma rather than critical thinking , technocracy rather than democracy , everyone who stands up to the unchecked power , whether it 's authoritarian leaders , plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens , or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few .
george papandreou : well , obviously there were constraints which did n't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted , and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem .
so i would drag myself into my dance studio — body , mind and spirit — every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped .
difficult .
durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
my story is a story of overcoming setbacks , obstacles and challenges that life throws at you .
it 's the power of focus .
it 's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .
many years later , my mom developed frozen shoulder , which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder .
this means the majority of patients do n't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better .
we then make that a video game to give patients simple , motivating objectives to follow .
she can see how much i moved , how many points i scored , with what speed i moved my joints , and so on .
if my mom or i had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy , then we would have been more successful following the treatment , and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner .
cosmin milhau : so it 's a microsoft surface pro 3 for the demo , but you just need a computer and a kinect , which is 120 dollars .
we use game dynamics to build on it . we build with mindshare .
this is me in the middle making faces .
`` then he said , `` '' but really , sarah , you could have worked harder ! ca n't you see it 's really too small ? '' '' indeed , it 's rather small . ''
i was born in algeria .
`` and in my head i would be thinking that `` '' doing '' '' a war meant being a soldier . ''
and indeed , i was very far from the mark .
so , his story . my father was born in argentina .
his parents were of russian descent .
and with his only diploma , his primary education certificate , he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner .
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
`` in order to survive , he needed to be working . he asked the man to write `` '' dyer . '' '' suddenly the man looked very , very interested . ''
he started inventing all kind of things — with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .
of course , there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that i understood much later .
he also explained to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
and then he would not come .
`` then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , `` well , perhaps our father has died . '' ''
after the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to palestine before the creation of israel .
and then , as he was a staunch anti-colonialist , he made false papers for algerians during the algerian war .
( laughter ) he was much younger in those days , and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting .
he told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he 'd had to make in all his life .
anyhow , nobody would have followed them , except for a handful [ of ] men and women of conviction and courage .
my father is here in the room today .
his name is adolfo kaminsky and i 'm going to ask him to stand up .
that 's about 36,000 , 37,000 dollars .
now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy , though i think it probably is , it 's actually not a very clever business strategy , actually .
now , it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job , but you 're not . you 're actually making yourself more useful .
and thirdly , we need to remember that , from a strictly economic point of view , design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly — mostly it 's done by amateurs .
most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what 's called the social economy or the core economy , which is people doing it for themselves .
so the challenge we face is , how are we going to build the tools , the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture 's social economy ?
and that 's where 3d printing gets really , really interesting .
and the parts are all numbered , and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit .
they do n't need any traditional construction skills .
contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school , copying is good .
it 's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the industrial revolution in these sorts of community barn-raisings .
a kind of wikipedia for stuff ?
`` a teacher once instructed me in the hallway : `` aaaaaas-king . '' ''
`` `` '' dena , it 's not 'axing , ' like you 're running around with an axe . ''
i attended boarding school and college in new england , studied abroad in chile and returned to the bronx to be a middle school teacher .
( cheers ) ( applause ) and then i landed a job at yale . ( applause )
i am proud of everything that i 've been able to accomplish on my journey thus far .
they also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives in the curricula .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
what kind of forms could we design if we would n't work with references anymore ?
and i 'm not saying that we should copy nature , i 'm not saying we should mimic biology , instead i propose that we can borrow nature 's processes .
nature 's main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells .
we can begin to sculpt the form .
we can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
columns are architectural archetypes .
we can begin to zoom into them .
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
these forms are undrawable .
there 's no randomness involved at all , but it 's not entirely predictable .
so this leads to a new role for the architect .
one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there .
machines are getting faster , it 's getting less expensive , and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
in short , we have no constraints .
`` my first visit to pixar was in 2005 , when they were working on `` '' ratatouille , '' '' that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef . ''
let 's think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie : no solo genius , no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies .
`` so if you think about that scene in `` '' up '' '' where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird , that 10 seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect . ''
`` it was beautiful , but he said , `` you 've got to lose it ; it does n't fit the character . '' ''
creative abrasion is not about brainstorming , where people suspend their judgment .
no , they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives .
it 's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process .
this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful .
one became known as big table , the other became known as build it from scratch .
so they selected that one .
`` early in that process , one of the engineers had gone to bill and said , `` '' we 're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments . '' '' but as the process unfolded , he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions . ''
they know how to do collaborative problem solving , they know how to do discovery-driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making .
but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again , we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about .
at pixar , they understand that innovation takes a village .
what do they focus their time on ?
let 's put in a policy that anyone , no matter what their level or role , is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film .
`` i 'm never a dictator of viewpoints . '' '' advice about how you exercise the role ? ''
some of you may be wondering now , what are these people thinking ?
they stopped giving answers , they stopped trying to provide solutions .
so i do n't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize ed .
and why do happy people cheat ?
and is an affair always the end of a relationship ?
and yet , this extremely common act is so poorly understood .
in fact , infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy , so much so , that this is the only commandment that is repeated twice in the bible : once for doing it , and once just for thinking about it .
because when it comes to sex , the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate , but the pressure for women is to hide , minimize and deny , which is n't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying .
now , everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat .
but the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding : sexting , watching porn , staying secretly active on dating apps .
( laughter ) now , i like this definition of an affair — it brings together the three key elements : a secretive relationship , which is the core structure of an affair ; an emotional connection to one degree or another ; and a sexual alchemy .
`` now , i question everything . '' '' infidelity — a violation of trust , a crisis of identity . ''
married , two kids .
`` nick just left on a business trip , and heather is playing on his ipad with the boys , when she sees a message appear on the screen : `` ca n't wait to see you . '' ''
but we also have never been more inclined to stray , and not because we have new desires today , but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires , because this is the culture where i deserve to be happy .
if even happy people cheat , what is it about ?
they often are people who have actually been faithful for decades , but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross , and at the risk of losing everything .
now , all over the world , there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me .
and contrary to what you may think , affairs are way less about sex , and a lot more about desire : desire for attention , desire to feel special , desire to feel important .
first of all , the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity .
( laughter ) so how do we heal from an affair ?
but for heather , or deceived partners , it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth , to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity .
now , you 've listened to me , and i know what you 're thinking : she has a french accent , she must be pro-affair .
i was exposed to him .
`` what are you going to do with it ? '' '' and his brother said , `` '' i just want to be able to talk to tony again . ''
`` these devices are n't accessible to people . '' '' and i said , `` '' well , how do you actually communicate ? '' '' has everyone seen the movie `` '' the diving bell and the butterfly ? '' '' that 's how they communicate — so run their finger along . ''
`` so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , `` '' well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why do n't we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . '' '' so that started the journey . ''
and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he 's looking over his life support system .
and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
this is an amazing device , but it 's the equivalent of an etch a sketch .
so we 're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
`` ( applause ) the coolest thing about this — and this is what 's completing the whole circle — is that in april of this year , at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles , there 's going to be an exhibition called `` '' art of the streets . '' '' and `` '' art of the streets '' '' is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene — banksy , shepard fairey , kaws — all of these guys will be there . ''
tempt 's going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remembering things that i 've done in the past .
when i turn 40 , i 'll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s .
it 's also kind of a protest , a personal protest , against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert , and they 're disturbing you .
it was something that i 've been dreaming about doing my whole life , just driving around the u.s. and canada and just figuring out where to go the next day , and it was kind of outstanding .
and i do n't know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
thank you .
so here 's one of the first poems i memorized .
it plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives .
it appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad ?
we let guys tell women what to do .
we meditate on past and future , life and death , above and below .
now when i think about the possibilities for life out there , i think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars .
and the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets .
and actually , it 's so hot , we ca n't visit any of these planets , but if we could , we would melt long before we got there .
we think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes .
not too big , not too small , not too hot , not too cold — but just right for life .
we actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here , from earth orbit .
but a really big challenge ahead of us is : how ?
and so i envision that our descendants , hundreds of years from now , will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds .
thank you .
but i do hope to take you to some places you 've never been to before .
so , let 's start off in china .
turns out that dai manju was the best pupil in her grade .
we got a flood of donations — mostly 13-dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts ( laughter ) but then , we got a money transfer for $ 10,000 — really nice guy .
`` he thought , `` '' oh , i can renovate the school . ''
she went to high school .
they built a new house , this time with running water , electricity , a bicycle , no pig .
and over the years , as we followed dai manju , we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .
in the 19th century , it was slavery .
`` so some of you may be thinking , `` '' gosh , that 's hyperbole . ''
but in most of the rest of the world , that 's not the case .
`` and someone from this side of the room got up and said , `` '' mr. gates , we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top 10 countries when it comes to technology . ''
today , you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars , which means she 's actually more disposable .
around the world , one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth .
you know , it 's not as though we do n't have the technological solution , but these women have three strikes against them : they are poor , they are rural and they are female .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .
and at the time , she was miserable .
`` saima 's not going to produce you a son . '' '' this is when she had her second daughter . ''
and now they have a third daughter , and the daughters , all of them , are being tutored in education because saima knows what 's really important .
actually , she had never been to school , not to a lick , one day .
`` her parents , again , said , `` '' why should we spend the money on her ? ''
there 's bill easterly 's book .
`` there 's a book called `` '' dead aid . '' '' you know , the criticism is fair ; it is n't easy . ''
one year , all the chickens died , and no one wanted to put the chickens in there .
and a movement of men and women is what 's needed to bring about social change , change that will address this great moral challenge .
and the second thing , it 's an anecdote that i 'll leave you with .
and she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they do n't go hungry in the winter .
join the movement .
feel happier and help save the world .
( applause )
for many years this went along , and everything was fine .
`` and so , he went forth to the people and he said , `` '' i 've made this wonderful finding : it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution , and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year , and we could spend that on our children in other ways . '' '' and the parents were very unhappy , and they said , `` '' this is a terrible thing , because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing ? '' '' and the government was very upset . ''
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which — there has n't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . ok .
so , many times when you try to do research on data , it records complicated stories — it 's hard to find in the data .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
if you put a child in a car seat , 18.2 percent of the children die .
if they 're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt , in this raw data , 19.4 percent die . and interestingly , wearing a lap-only seatbelt , 16.7 percent die . and actually , the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt 's got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt . and that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data , there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way .
so what we do in the study is — and this is just presenting the same information , but turned into a figure to make it easier .
so you can only get so far , i think , in telling your story by using these abstract statistics .
so here — this is the car seat . now watch two things : watch how the head goes forward , and basically hits the knees — and this is in the car seat — and watch how the car seat flies around , in the rebound , up in the air .
bear in mind there are two things about this .
so the next one . now , this is the kid , same crash , who is in the seatbelt . he hardly moves at all , actually , relative to the other child . the funny thing is , the cam work is terrible because they 've only set it up to do the car seats , and so , they actually do n't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that 's on the rebound .
so , in some sense , what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong , which is putting children at risk . it 's just that , fundamentally , the car seats are n't doing much .
and then here 's the six-year-old in the seatbelt , and in fact , they get exactly within , you know , within one or two points of the same . so really , for the six-year-old , the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever .
`` that 's some more evidence , so in some sense — i was criticized by a scientist , who said , `` '' you could never publish a study with an n of 4 , '' '' meaning those four crashes . ''
you 've got a regular seat for adults , and then you fold it down , and the kid sits on top , and it 's integrated .
so , my dad always took that as evidence that this little , teeny , powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect . and in some sense , if that 's the right story , i think integrated car seats you will see , very quickly , becoming something that everyone has . the other possible conclusion is , well , maybe after coming to my father three times , getting sent home with placebos , he still felt sick , he went and found another doctor .
( applause ) ( audience : i just wanted to ask you , when we wear seatbelts we do n't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life , it 's also to prevent lots of serious injury .
but it 's obviously a critical question .
put in other language , it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside .
in other words , this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going , what its strategy is , what financial targets it has in place , and understanding your role in moving the organization forward .
engaging the greatness in others .
well , there are primarily three reasons that there 's this missing 33 percent in the career success advice given to women ?
much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take , like become more assertive , become more confident , develop your personal brand , things that tonya 's been working on , and advice about working with other people , things like learn to self-promote , get a mentor , enhance your network , and virtually nothing said about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen .
now , tonya also talked about working with a mentor , and this is really important to talk about , because if organizations , talent and performance systems are n't giving people in general information about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen , how are men getting to the top ?
well , this comment from an executive that i worked with recently illustrates that experience .
and executives know this very well , and yet only 37 percent , according to a recent conference board report , believe that they have that strategic alignment in place .
`` it 's important for ceos to also expect these proportional pools , and if they hear comments like , `` well , she does n't have enough business experience , '' ask the question , `` what are we going to do about that ? '' ''
so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya 's story .
once , he jumped out of our third floor apartment .
( laughter ) and most of us do not take the person we 're dating back to the bar where we met them or give them back to the friend that introduced us , or sign them back up on match.com . ( laughter )
so let 's talk about diagnosis for a minute .
i 'm going to show you just a couple examples .
they can be too scared to approach men with beards or to hop into cars .
the first thing to remember is : our brain is inherited .
the vertebrates came out of the sea , and here we are .
( laughter ) octopuses use tools , as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces .
mostly boiled .
this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about .
a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they 're doing to show their babies what to do , which is called teaching .
killer whales teach and killer whales share food .
if you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain , what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain .
they have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep , while they doze but remain vigilant .
they know us better than we know them .
we are kin under the skin .
courtship is courtship .
it 's a very useful thing .
the oldest form of empathy is contagious fear .
i see you happy , it makes me happy .
`` i do n't feel that same grief , but i get it ; i know what you feel and it concerns me . '' '' and then if we 're motivated to act on sympathy , i call that compassion . ''
that 's just predation , and humans are predators .
i know i can trust him because we 're family .
they 've known each other for decades .
this is an elephant named philo .
and then people came .
people came by the thousands to see the wolves , the most accessibly visible wolves in the world .
the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family .
and that 's happened more than one time .
it 's not special to us .
but we , who have named ourselves after our brains , never think about the consequences .
we paint animals to show them that we are not alone .
and every one of those animals in every painting of noah 's ark , deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now , and their flood is us .
so we started with a question : do they love us ?
i am going to be talking about secrets .
( laughter ) secrets . i 'm using powerpoint this year just because , you know , i 'm into the ted thing . ( laughter )
( laughter ) oh , man . um , yes . ( laughter )
change it ! come on ! what ?
we can see that all formulas are really maps .
now , as humans , we make maps of places that we seldom even go , which seems a little wasteful of time .
frigoris ? this is the moon . people could live there one day .
this is from their actual book .
if that do n't flow off the tongue , what does ?
( laughter ) left to the thymiamata .
and then of course arnon to thoth .
this is from their rule book , the international astronomical union .
`` and you know they 're international because they put it `` '' en francais '' '' as well . ''
`` `` '' yeah , that 's the goat goddess right ? the abacazanian ? ''
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
is that mars ya marov ?
`` `` no , i want to make maps of planets . '' ''
`` `` yeah , go to your room . '' ''
the five sacred solids , as you can see there .
what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other .
october 9th , in france , jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
but what they 're seeing , way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background , is this kind of odd undulation .
( laughter ) i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there . but ... ( laughter )
that guy is rockin ' .
i do n't get that at all .
this is sierra leone .
( laughter ) man . i do n't really need to comment on this .
it 's a different kind of course . and they 've got five apples ?
but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently .
that 's jude law and some of his films recently did n't work .
here is the premise that i began 27 years ago .
and i tried to build a particle accelerator .
you can see , even if you do n't go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
( laughter ) and you 'll see over here , these are multiples of the number 27 .
am i the only one that sees this ?
( laughter ) thank you very much .
i have four small children , and i would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness , but sometimes it 's just not their fault .
and the idea is that we 'll shave bits of time off everyday activities , add it up , and we 'll have time for the good stuff .
she comes home to find that her water heater has broken , and there is now water all over her basement .
and what this shows us is that time is highly elastic .
of course , right ?
using this language reminds us that time is a choice .
what three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
so you can write next year 's family holiday letter now .
or maybe you want to run a 5k .
making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories .
well , that leaves 52 hours for other things .
you can use your bits of time for bits of joy .
maybe it 's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work .
i understand we have over 80 countries here , so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries .
and i was influenced by performance art — so this is 20 years ago . i made a computer out of people .
remember that excitement ?
or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface . ( laughter ) like , we got ta go to fear . ( laughter ) it 's , like , amazing , right ? ( laughter ) ( applause ) it just changes the same content .
i can never get in there . ( laughter ) it 's just amazing , fear . but that 's form , content .
free even light feels kind of like , ah , i can breathe in free .
so i made a lot of work in the '90s .
`` and they 'd say , `` '' daddy , why does n't the computer respond to sound ? '' '' and it was really at the time i was wondering why does n't the computer respond to sound ? ''
`` it 's called `` '' tap , type , write . '' '' it 's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary . ''
it has 10 variations . ( typing noise ) ( typing noise ) there 's a shift .
ten variations . this is , like , spin the letter around .
`` it is n't about `` '' old , '' '' the dirt , `` '' new , '' '' the cloud . it 's about what is good . ''
we are n't a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
`` and also `` '' no love . '' '' ( laughter ) so that is authoritarianism . ''
this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont on creative leadership . what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead ?
because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
someone who 's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
`` i was like , `` '' oh , this my job . president . i do a lot of meetings , you know ? '' '' and by the end of the experience , i realized why i was doing this . ''
and one thing i 've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective .
and in my case , as i was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
and this thought process that i went through as a child , and have been through many times since , including as a grown-up , is a product of what psychologists call a bias .
they work like this .
even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
now , this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe , regardless of the evidence , and it works not just for religion , but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form , whether it 's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism , which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole .
now i 'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story , and i want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they 're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day .
but the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir , a story that is as old as civilization .
when we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they 're all dead .
so we need a backup plan , and exactly this kind of plan b is what the second kind of immortality story offers , and that 's resurrection .
now , the majority of people on earth believe they have a soul , and the idea is central to many religions .
but even though , in its current form , in its traditional form , the idea of the soul is still hugely popular , nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age , for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind , your essence , the real you , onto a computer , and so live on as an avatar in the ether .
all you need is an internet connection and a funny cat . ( laughter ) but some people prefer to leave a more tangible , biological legacy — children , for example .
or they like , they hope , to live on as part of some greater whole , a nation or a family or a tribe , their gene pool .
rather , we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them , and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death .
`` long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of `` '' treasure island . '' '' and so it should be with us . ''
pat mitchell : so i was thinking about female friendship a lot , and by the way , these two women , i 'm very honored to say , have been my friends for a very long time , too .
`` he said , `` '' you can tell a lot about someone , '' '' in this case a woman , `` by the company that she keeps . '' ''
`` i mean it 's , `` '' i have my friends , therefore i am . '' '' lt : ( laughter ) jf : no , it 's true . ''
pm : well , as we grow older , and as we go through different kinds of life 's journeys , what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive ?
lt : well you have to use a lot of — jf : she does n't invite me over much , i 'll tell you that .
jf : do you do emojis ?
lt : i think i 'd trade the years for joy .
which is a feel-good , calming , stress-reducing hormone .
i meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to — ( laughter ) jf : you know something , though , that i find very interesting — and again , psychologists did n't know this until relatively recently — is that men are born every bit as relational as women are .
they do n't ask for help .
you know , his sense of self .
jf : women 's friendships are like a renewable source of power .
pm : needing new role models on how to do that .
and most of all , it was not even in my college textbooks .
we learned of marshall kay 's geosynclinal cycle , which is a bunch of crap .
`` in fact , i have another version at my office and i ask people , `` '' why are there mountains here , on this area here , but there are none over here ? '' '' and they go , `` '' well , gee , i do n't know , '' '' saying , `` is it a fracture zone ? is it a hot spot ? '' ''
all right . so we 're going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because , you know , it 's really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources on the continents .
alvin and sea cliff and cyana , and all the major deep submersibles we have , which are about eight .
but if you were to put it on an equal area projection , you 'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the earth 's total surface area .
most of our planet is in eternal darkness .
that 's why you get , you know , you get seashells up on mount everest .
we understood mountains under compression , but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension .
`` the pilot made this great observation : `` '' that 's hot . '' '' ( laughter ) and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff — it could have melted . but it turns out the exiting temperature was 650 degrees f , hot enough to melt lead . ''
everything you see in this picture is commercial grade : copper , lead , silver , zinc and gold .
so , i began designing a new technology of telepresence , using robotic systems to replicate myself , so i would n't have to cycle my vehicle system .
the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms .
they came across new creatures they had not seen before .
and lost city was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools . look at that .
near that was methane . i 've never seen volcanoes of methane .
`` people always ask , `` '' did you find the right ship ? '' '' it said yorktown on the stern . ''
how many ancient mariners have had a bad day ? the number 's a million .
and within that , we 're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine , blue-gold team , switching them off and on , running 24 hours a day .
it 's a big blank sheet on our planet . we 'll map it within hours , have the maps disseminated out to the major universities .
they can follow this expedition . i 've started a program — where are you jim ? jim young who helped me start a program called the jason project . more recently , we 've started a program with the boys and girls clubs of america , so that we can use exploration , and the excitement of live exploration , to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they 're already ready for .
as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .

dm : inventing his own narrative .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory .
with graphics , computing power , low latencies , these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives .
but we want to use our brain !
that 's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity .
you can see the camera on the front . we collect multiple viewpoints , vantage points , angles , textures . we bring all that data back in .
i bet many of you have seen the apple commercials , kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity .
well , a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team .
this was after katrina . we were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone .
they 'd collected information with photos . they 'd manually build each building .
i thank you very much for your time .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it 's definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in iran , because that 's where most of the infections had been reported .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
here 's some very cool stuff that we saw — really knocked my socks off .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
and you do n't have — as an attacker — you do n't have to deliver this payload by a usb stick , as we saw it in the case of stuxnet .
thanks .
ralph , it 's been quite widely reported that people assume that mossad is the main entity behind this .
ralph langner : okay , you really want to hear that ?
the village mayor was our first friend and he loved our t-shirts , so that helped .
iw : but , who would have guessed one million signatures is , like , a thousand times a thousand ?
off we headed to the airport .
and then it was his boss 's boss , and then the assistant office manager , and then the office manager , and then ...
lesson number four : you need champions at all levels of society , from students to commercial managers to famous people .
we went to india to give a talk , and our parents took us to visit the former private house of mahatma gandhi .
we knew we were n't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike — we could have gone to jail .
twenty-four hours later , we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor .
`` iw : our short-term campaign , `` one island / one voice , '' is all about this . ''
and we also have more than five billion of these devices here .
this is a 6 with 14 zeroes — a very large number .
that is efficiency .
you have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
these radio waves penetrate through walls .
they can be intercepted , and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions .
but on the other hand , we have 14 billion of these : light bulbs , light .
and it creates a simple , low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second , 20,000 bits per second .
and that 's a video , a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam .
you 're critical .
and if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect .
but , you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off .
capacity : we have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more leds installed already in the infrastructure there .
and there 's only data where there is light .
but i can give you a few examples .
there are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin , and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data .
( applause )
now , the combination of both effects — the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance — is exactly a superconductor .
now , under proper conditions , which we have here , these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor .
and by doing that , what it actually does is locking itself in place .
so , this is quantum locking — actually locking — three-dimensional locking of the superconductor .
and , yeah , the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick . it 's extremely thin .
and this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight .
( applause ) you see , it 's quantum locking , not levitation .
now , while i 'll let it circulate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconductors .
now — ( laughter ) — so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in mri machines , particle accelerators and so on .
but we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation .
and we could also produce power cables , to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations .
well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example .
amazing . thank you .
i think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared , and i think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature , your own cognitive habits , and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully .
( applause ) they have no idea what we 're going to do .
but what 's important about it is how it is that they 're grasping information , how they 're taking information , how they 're using it , and how they 're thinking with it .
`` so all i 'm doing is exploring this space of `` '' t '' '' and flashing through it with some action . ''
okay . from there i 'm going to do a very different thing .
so what i 'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as i move , and i move them , and i do that by suggesting things to them : if , then ; if , then . okay , so here we go .
can you place that down into the floor ?
separate . face the front . separate . face the front .
avoid it . avoid it . whoom . kick it out of the way .
let me just see that a little bit . ready , and go .
the first one , body-to-body transfer , yeah , with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me .
`` if this , if that happens — `` '' i 've got lots of methods like that , but it 's very , very quick , and this is a third method . ''
so i 'd like us just to do , we 're going to do a little mental dance , a little , in this little one minute , so what i 'd love you to do is imagine , you can do this with your eyes closed , or open , and if you do n't want to do it you can watch them , it 's up to you .
what i 'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it .
if you reach with your elbow , where would it be ?
`` if i already then said about that space that you 're in , let 's infuse it with the color red , what does that do to the body ? if i then said to you , what happens if that whole wall on the side of `` '' e '' '' collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up , what would you be able to do with it ? ''
so the dancers have been working on them .
( clicks metronome ) here it comes , cat . ( clicks metronome ) paolo , go . ( clicks metronome ) last you solo .
they produce six different types of silk , which is spun together into a fiber , tougher than any fiber humans have ever made .
and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water .
this beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away .
so i 'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency .
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes .
so for instance , you could develop super-efficient roof structures based on giant amazon water lilies , whole buildings inspired by abalone shells , super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells .
the way we tend to use resources is we extract them , we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them .
and i 'm just going to talk through this animation .
and i know it 's a quirky example , but i think the implications of this are quite radical , because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem — waste — into a massive opportunity .
some of you may recognize this .
so for instance , when julius caesar arrived in north africa , huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .
just before sunrise , he tips his shell up , the water runs down into his mouth , has a good drink , goes off and hides for the rest of the day .
this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions , and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills , and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through , it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .
some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts .
some trained musicians out there .
so to put the question a little more seriously , let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did , for spontaneous synchronization .
i mean , i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong — it 's not .
now , to get into that , let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we 're talking about synchrony in nature , which is the glorious example of birds that flock together , or fish swimming in organized schools .
so these are not particularly intelligent creatures , and yet , as we 'll see , they exhibit beautiful ballets .
i 'll show you a computer model made by iain couzin , a researcher at oxford , that shows how swarms work .
the prey move out in random directions , and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again , so there 's this constant splitting and reforming .
that is , out of the desire to save itself , each creature is following these rules , and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them .
as i say , it 's just those three simple rules , plus the one about watch out for predators .
they each do their own thing , flashing on and off , paying no attention to their neighbors .
but in southeast asia — places like thailand or malaysia or borneo — there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies .
the trees , mangrove trees , are filled with fireflies communicating with light .
but i hope you 've convinced yourself now , with this nighttime video , that they really were very well synchronized .
they 're keeping you alive .
i do n't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea .
hold your breath for me .
can you hear that ?
right ? they did .
now , you might think that 's a bizarre idea .
how can metronomes communicate ?
boy : it was about — interviewer : i mean , that much , or this much ?
interviewer : this much ? boy : yeah .
and then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go . right .
man : that 's right . and it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it .
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .
but how could the crowd become synchronized ?
so already , the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge .
so on the subject of deception , i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors .
everything , apart from the dialogue , is fake .
when you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings — ( wings flap ) they have n't really recorded the bird .
( water splashes at lower octave ) and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies .
( water splashes ) and by looping and repeating that sound , they got this : ( propeller churns ) so , creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we 're inside the submarine .
( gunshot ) by adding reverb , we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom .
( gunshot reverbs in bathroom ) or like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church .
( gunshot reverbs in canyon ) so reverb gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source .
we often relate silences with ...
there 's always some sort of noise .
( birds chirp ) on the other hand , industrial sounds have been introduced to us a little more recently .
( thunder ) church bells can remind us of the passing of time , or perhaps our own mortality .
i think the mathematician and philosopher thought that , in that way , his students might focus more on the voice , and his words and its meaning , rather than the visual of him speaking .
we actually sit every few years , argue , disagree , fight , and actually come up with our very own 200-year plan .
our friends think we 're mad .
you know ?
you know , a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer .
the latest date i put was , i said , i am going to expire my fear of my leftist , feminist mother-in-law , and this today is the date ! ( laughs ) she 's watching . ( laughter ) anyway , you know , i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself , and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make .
name it , i 'm on it .
how , you may ask ?
and i woke up from my visualization and i said , who was that ? i could n't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha , two very famous indian actresses , like the meryl streeps of india .
netra 's a high school history teacher . i love netra , but i hate history .
`` then she said , `` '' choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity . '' '' history as an imaging tool ? ''
it lets us create who we are , and curate what is to come .
give me predictability , give me surprise .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
we want to neutralize the tensions .
wanting them is one thing .
it starts very young .
they do n't really do well together .
but what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity , extreme poverty , facts that build a powerful momentum .
seven thousand kids a day . here 's two of them .
but it 's heart-stopping . it 's mind-blowing stuff .
and the next one is really beautiful .
we know the obstacles that are in our way right now , in difficult times .
daylight , you could call it , transparency .
it 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff .
you can erase that , you really can , because it 's not true anymore . ( applause ) it 's transformational .
it 's not going to kill you .
some of you know him . he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square in cairo .
`` we are going to win because we have dreams , and we 're willing to stand up for those dreams . '' '' wael is right . ''
`` most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain , they say , `` '' it does n't look what you 're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain . '' '' typically , what you 're looking at is a fixed brain . it 's gray . ''
they 're probably less cell dense .
there are also these smaller cells as you 'll see .
these are proteins .
it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data .
and then what we get is our first mapping .
and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .
our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what 's called laser scanning microdissection .
this has roughly 60,000 elements on it , so we repeatedly measure various genes of the 25,000 genes in the genome .
now we do this over and over again , this process for any given brain .
there 's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn , it allows you to zoom in , it allows you to highlight individual structures .
so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
and for the first time , we can actually do that .
`` most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , `` '' scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x . '' '' and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great . they analyze large populations . ''
they look at their entire genomes , and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes .
and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four , which are the exceptions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells .
whether or not that 's due to an individual 's genetic background or their experiences , we do n't know .
thanks .
i had my first apartment , my first little green american express card , and i had a very big secret .
it may even be your story .
i do n't look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
my dog is a black lab , and i drive a honda odyssey minivan .
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it 's a women 's issue .
i was 22 , and in the united states , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the united states .
one of the smartest things conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship .
now , the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york , and my dream job , but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so i agreed , and i quit my job , and conor and i left manhattan together .
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
why did n't i walk out ? i could have left any time .
what i will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
this is from marlboro country .
one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
but , of course , each emotion then would need a particular antidote .
it 's something that is totally out of the bell curve .
we love to do jogging , fitness .
flying monks .
our most recent move is the paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world .
it shows basically co2 emissions around the world over the next 30 years .
the final thing that you should notice is that each year , about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet 's atmosphere , and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land .
that 's on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today .
they provide an alternative .
eastern europe , still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal , and with natural gas that comes from russia , with all of its entanglements .
china has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe .
it allowed water pipes to be placed .
first of all , we have to think about the magnitude of the problem .
this week , between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants are being turned on around the world .
and that 's going to happen unless they have a better alternative .
and third , it had to be cost-effective without subsidy or without mandate .
that 's what the eia forecast tells us .
outdated regulations and yesterday 's mindsets .
it gets better and better , and when you combine that with white lab coats , you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this .
you could take the smell from the female dog , and the dogs would chase the cloth .
but gradually we learn what 's not good , and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good is what is good .
you 're part of the in-group .
now , i 'm not going to share them with you , but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones .
they simply do n't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
so it does n't apply to 20 percent of the world .
it appears that the more secretions she 's got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
so do go forward and do search for more .
two years ago at ted , i think — i 've come to this conclusion — i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion .
i had this company that i 'd spent 15 years building . it 's called future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
this has been a big , big transition time , and i believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever 's next .
you can ask what are the psychological causes of it : nature ? nurture ? current circumstance ?
it 's the mental equivalent of the full body massage .
so , i will . here 's the vision for ted .
`` jeff bezos kindly remarked to me , `` '' chris , ted is a really great conference . ''
`` you 're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . '' '' ( laughter ) so , i gave myself the job title of ted custodian for a reason , and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with . ''
number two : i am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year .
and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this book club .
books kind of saved me in the last couple years , and that 's a gift that i would like to pass on .
and then , fourthly : i want to mention the sapling foundation , which is the new owner of ted .
this is more or less china , u.s. , canada and brazil all together , in terms of size , to have an idea .
( chainsaw sound ) ( sound of falling tree ) twenty-seven thousand square kilometers in one year .
it 's very important for conflicts .
fifty million hectares of protected areas were created , which is an area the size of spain .
( applause ) so if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade , we saved 8.7 million hectares , which is the size of austria .
two ways , two tons .
so 11 billion tons is twice that .
same thing could happen in the energy sector .
today , 500 billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels .
i mean , it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in .
who was i ?
so i 'm on the right stage .
this , i think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it would n't occur to anyone to question it .
i could n't have done better .
right now ? and when i think about it , i 'm really worried . to be quite frank , i 'm concerned . i 'm skeptical that we 're doing very much of anything .
we 're , in a sense , failing to act in the future . we 're purposefully , consciously being laggards .
you see , when i was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager , i loved designing and making dogs ' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer .
biotechnology is constructive .
it 's our attempt to influence things , the universe internal to ourselves and external to us .
let me say it again another way : science provides an understanding of a universal experience , and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience .
intuitive versus analytical ?
we got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers . they came to dartmouth college , where i was teaching , and they talked about with theologians and financiers , what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research ? what 's most important about it ?
we have corporate funding now that , when it goes to some company , when it goes to support the arts , it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws , and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations .
i like to think of ideas as potential energy .
( applause )
that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire .
we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be .
there 's some bumps along the way , but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it .
it 's growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution .
according to the numbers , the music industry is half the size that it was 10 years ago , but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever .
now let 's look to the future .
in the age of big data , we can measure the world in ways we never could before .
now individually , digital , exponential and combinatorial would each be game-changers .
put them together , and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs , like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound .
recently , its teachers let it surf the internet unsupervised .
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
today , we can take a routine job , codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions , and then replicate it a million times .
but 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
the answer is not to try to slow down technology .
what they had was better teamwork , and they showed that a team of humans and computers , working together , could beat any computer or any human working alone .
when she got up to make tea , she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated .
chris anderson : kirsten , will you just take one minute , just to tell your own story of how you got to africa ?
ca : just — ka : actually , i was working at the time , doing production for a fashion photographer .
and i first actually went to botswana , where i spent a month — this is in december 2000 — then went to zimbabwe for a month and a half , and then went back again this march 2002 for another month and a half in zimbabwe .
they are more dynamic .
think of steve jobs ' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at stanford , where he said to be innovative , you 've got to stay hungry , stay foolish .
and in places like europe , it might be more equitable , we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the u.s. , but the problem is this damn public sector .
`` we all hope it might be something green , or all of this nanotech stuff , and in order for that stuff to happen , '' '' they say — this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution — they say , `` '' the state , just stick to the basics , right ? ''
these are the very smart , revolutionary bits about the iphone , and they 're all government-funded .
in fact , companies like pfizer and amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on r & d , but that 's a whole different ted talk which one day i 'd be fascinated to tell you about .
the private sector does a lot .
but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics , but not really providing that sort of high-risk , revolutionary thinking out of the box .
`` even the words that we often use to justify the `` '' p '' '' part , the public part — well , they 're both p 's — with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking . ''
what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you , and there 's many more , which myself and other colleagues have been looking at , is doing much more than de-risking .
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations .
one out of 10 experiments has any success .
but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state — apple 's a great example .
they even got the first — well , not the first , but 500,000 dollars actually went to apple , the company , through this sbic program , which predated the sbir program , as well as , as i said before , all the technologies behind the iphone .
this , by the way , in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically , countries like finland in scandinavia , but also in china and brazil , they 're retaining equity in these investments .
thank you .
now , this is n't just a contemporaneous question .
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
well , predictions of world peace ? check . ( laughter ) more arguing ? gold star on that one . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) i mean , youtube is just a gold mine . ( laughter ) better arguing ? that 's the question .
and you do n't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this .
this is linus torvalds .
and to give you a sense of how enormous a decision like this was , this is a map of the internal dependencies within linux , within the linux operating system , which sub-parts of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going .
this is a tremendously complicated program , and yet , for years , torvalds ran this not with automated tools but out of his email box .
it has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
the first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open-source . everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time .
this has the following effect : a programmer in edinburgh and a programmer in entebbe can both get the same — a copy of the same piece of software .
this is cooperation without coordination .
this is the big change .
to which i have to say , here 's the thing with the singing cats . that always happens .
the stuff in green is the stuff that got added .
programmers take this capability for granted .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it 's the unfortunate fact that we ca n't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
and let me begin with one example .
clearly , patient b suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
and they 're all — happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
so the correlation is low .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
ca : well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at least should be — the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
now , as far as it goes , there 's a lot of oil out there in the world .
here 's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil , and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years .
it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to decline .
now , i 'll tell you another little , very important story about this picture .
what is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?
here 's a piece of limestone .
i picked it up outside of marble falls , texas .
it 's not because we have a lot of it .
attached to the facial bones that define our face 's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression , our universal language of expression , our social-signaling system .
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .
it 's a crippling time .
so she chose to have facial surgery .
`` after the facial surgery , she said , `` '' my face now reflects my personality . ''
he enjoyed life to the full , and this was probably because he had a successful , fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially .
this is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the united kingdom to have operated on .
after she had surgery to remove the tumor , her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress , a pink ribbon in her hair , and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world , despite the fact that they were orthodox muslims and the mother wore a full burqa .
he said you could see criminal faces , judging them just on the photographs that were showed .
now we know that he 's a convicted wife-batterer , and actually he 's not the good guy .
are we uncomfortable with this image ? yes , we are .
would we be happy if our doctor 's face , our lawyer 's face , our financial adviser 's face was covered ?
`` `` i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . '' ''
so with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
so the patient 's life is restored .
it 's skin from his back .
what does that mean ?
we 're still not curing enough patients — it 's the most disfiguring cancer .
we still ca n't get rid of scars .
so i 'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we 've got some solutions underway .
they go bad very quickly if you do n't , and if you do n't have stable power grid , this does n't happen , so kids die .
so we made this thing .
so a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in africa and around the world .
one does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic 's glucose meter works : you take a drop of blood , you put it in there and it automatically tells you .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you did n't have to draw the blood .
we 're kind of software guys , and so nearly any problem that you pose , we like to try to solve with some software .
one of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you do n't know what 's the most effective thing to do .
so that sets the stage on which you do this .
and this is this latter part of the rainy season .
here , we 're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we 're illuminating with a laser .
once upon a time , this was the primary technique , and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through ddt .
what if we could do that ?
now , just suspend disbelief for a moment , and let 's think of what could happen if we could do that .
you really want to protect them .
eric johanson : what we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage .
next we can actually light them up with a laser . ( laughter ) now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .
here we have it running at high-speed mode .
( laughter ) we 'll loop around here in just a second , and you 'll see another one .
this is the lowland tapir , the tapir species i work with , the largest terrestrial mammal of south america .
that 's half the size of a horse .
we have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are .
this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it .
but the point is , maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done .
and i 'll keep doing this for ted , a baby tapir we captured in december last year also in the pantanal .
video : narrator : an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
and i found that in 29 seconds , it tells more about the power of , and importance of , independent media than i could say in an hour .
and also start with a little bit of statistics .
at that time at the beginning of the '90s , we had that problem , which was , you know , survival below one side , but what was really painful for me was , remember , the beginning of the '90s , yugoslavia is falling apart .
he was running a media systems organization which is still in business , the gentleman is still in business .
because i thought , i still maintain , that serious and independent media companies are great business .
anyway , after that whole , big , long explanation , the only question he had for me — and this is not a joke — is , are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson ?
now we go from here , fast forward to 1995 .
and basically what i was saying is very simple .
at the end of the meeting he says , look , it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea .
( laughter ) i knew two things after that meeting .
so i thought , why do n't we get into that business ?
they want to — the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press .
i get these two pieces of paper , not like this , a4 format , so it 's much bigger .
lately we are going wild , charging seven percent from time to time .
return rate — the one that soros was so worried about — 97 percent .
anyway , he 's running independent newspaper there .
how much would that cost ?
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center .
it 's actually just a drop in the sea .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night — this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa .
and it 's why it was invented .
now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room .
now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left .
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click .
this is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
and i think iron man would be proud .
now what you 're seeing is called augmented reality , but to me , it 's part of a much more important story — a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices , instead of the other way around .
in the next few years , humanity 's going to go through a shift , i think .
and it 's very , very important that we get this right , because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we 've lived with the windows graphical user interface .
and i do n't know about you , but living inside of windows scares me .
ray : great . we 're live today .
( applause ) mg : so folks , this is the message that i discovered in that bar in 2011 : the future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens .
thank you very much .
thanks , guys .
well obviously this is a replica .
we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other .
these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields .
can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right ?
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
one of the signs is also below the text on the top .
languages contain patterns .
now if i asked you to predict one more letter , what do you think that would be ?
now there 's several thoughts . there 's e. it could be i. it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
there 's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks-like symbol .
and the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other .
you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of wheel of fortune .
if you do n't know dutch and you only know english and i give you some words in dutch , you 'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns .
there could be other solutions .
so we have no way of validating these particular readings , but if more and more of these readings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track .
and in fact , this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience .
now , understanding how this works is very complex , because first of all , recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult .
now , one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body .
and the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain .
and that 's interesting , because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait , and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
now around chernobyl , there are scattered ghost villages , eerily silent , strangely charming , bucolic , totally contaminated .
so it 's hard for us to understand , but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka , and connection to the land is palpable .
the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
are we there yet ?
josh .
one is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who ca n't walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions .
to us americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?
they are fed . they remain valuable .
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the internet .
older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
ads for coca-cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca-cola and beer .
that means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people , and that each old person has less individual value .
for example , only americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs .
even if they do n't come back , we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like .
conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 .
of course , i 'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle .
it actually also does this with incredible prudence , detecting and reacting to every tiny threat , and furthermore , remembering every previous threat , in case they are ever encountered again .
so bob , just tell me honestly , what do you think of my product ?
did n't they teach you 80-20 ?
i 'm sorry to break it to you , but i do n't think this one is a winner .
but we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing to the disruption of technology .
everything we know about archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books , and they 're called a , b and c .
and to make his prayer book he used parchment .
but he did n't use new parchment , he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts , and there were seven of them .
he wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous .
the top half is elmer 's wood glue .
it 's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that does n't dissolve in water once it 's dry .
and the candle wax was dirty , and we could n't image through the wax .
and here is an image of a page imaged in 14 different wavebands of light .
and here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
but no one knew what archimedes was doing with these 14 bits .
and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics .
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
`` aristotle 's `` '' categories '' '' is one of the foundational texts of western philosophy . ''
and we found a third century a.d. commentary on it , possibly by galen and probably by porphyry .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
it 's going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
and that is the future of the web .
now the walters art museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts , but the data is fantastic .
because what 's really in it for the institution is this : now why do people go to the louvre ?
thank you very much indeed .
blood .
a phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it .
( laughter ) you know what i learned from it ?
i grew up in a small town called garhwa , in jharkhand , where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful .
i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance .
and in the absence of any intervention , it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation .
can you imagine what this does to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl ?
where do the girls go ?
these stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle .
that 's what we wanted .
pinki , who has not gotten her period yet , jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and mira who has already been getting her period .
there is a fourth character , priya didi .
while making the book , we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive .
they were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own .
and one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in ladakh .
`` we made the final version of the book , called `` '' menstrupedia comic '' '' and launched in september last year . ''
we talk things over with our friends , we scour the internet , we search through books .
that if you file your tax returns yourself , you 're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you ?
and i 'm saying this as an economist who , over the past few years , has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why , but also — and i 'm aware of the irony here — as an expert myself , as a professor , as somebody who advises prime ministers , heads of big companies , international organizations , but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change , that we need to become more open-minded , more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view .
now there are , of course , exceptions , wonderful , civilization-enhancing exceptions .
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks — because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they 're about to bring by market .
the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study .
being a rebel is about recognizing that experts ' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed .
`` second , we need to create the space for what i call `` '' managed dissent . '' '' if we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we 're bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction — and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views . ''
but we need to go even further .
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
you know , i do n't even believe in the concept of an ideal family .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
in fact , when there was a wedding in our neighborhood , all of us would paint our houses for the wedding .
but when you shake it , you get pakistan 's perspective .
shake it again , and you get the british perspective .
we all want to be stars — celebrities , singers , comedians — and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
ka : last year , bear vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
so what happened here ?
jimmy kimmel actually .
well tosh.0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
`` and now there are 10,000 parodies of `` '' friday '' '' on youtube . ''
( laughter ) someone made an old timey version . ( laughter )
an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
ohhhh .
so many books actually have been written over the years .
( applause ) now people tend to use an alternative approach , which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully .
they have digitized millions of books .
now when google digitizes a book , they put it into a really nice format .
and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that 's not the highest quality data .
`` we took a page out of xkcd , and we said , `` '' stand back . ''
now we 're thinking , what data can we release ?
ela : so those two billion lines , we call them two billion n-grams .
`` and so i might say , `` '' yesterday , i throve . '' '' alternatively , i could say , `` '' yesterday , i thrived . '' '' well which one should i use ? ''
`` as of about six months ago , the state of the art in this field is that you would , for instance , go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair , and you 'd say , `` '' steve , you 're an expert on the irregular verbs . ''
`` he 'd say , `` '' well , in my day , most people throve , but some thrived . '' '' so now what i 'm just going to show you is raw data . ''
for instance , this one .
they could n't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 , all the things they were planning to do in 1950 , all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 .
`` we can say , `` '' well how fast does the bubble burst ? '' '' and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely . ''
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you 're interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
so people want to be their best , put their best foot forward .
but it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
and the past shapes who we are and who we will be .
the story continues in the 1980s and '90s .
along with the emergence of hip-hop , african-american social dance took on even more visibility , borrowing from its long past , shaping culture and being shaped by it .
so , this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it 's also inaccurate and disrespectful .
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
the workers rarely spoke about the products they made , and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did .
she could n't even tell me what she did on the factory floor .
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he 's making ?
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i ca n't afford to buy an ad in it .
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory , and every single one of them was authentic .
i also worried that nothing would ever happen to them , or that they would have nothing to say to me .
their parents are often illiterate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the weekends , they 'll take a computer class , they 'll take an english class , and learn really , really rudimentary things , you know , like how to type a document in word , or how to say really simple things in english .
so , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what 's going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they 'll move on into higher jobs within apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
thank you very much . ( applause )
i had maybe nine months .
`` but even then they were n't convinced and said , `` '' okay , we 'll phone you back '' '' — never did . ''
i poured it into the mold , which you can see there , which i 've made from a tree trunk .
and they 're at the sharp end of what 's called the weee , which is this european electrical and electronic waste directive .
( applause ) bruno giussani : i 'm told you did plug it in once .
and that influence affects all of us , every day , regardless of your own belief .
i said i was going to be the first female president of the united states .
i was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they 're terrified of coming out to our community as gay .
this was where i felt safe . this is certainty and clarity about life .
the first thing we did was raise consciousness .
those arguments do n't work , and i know because i remember someone telling me that i was stupid for being mormon .
and what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in , because we 're not stupid .
in mormonism , we believe that after you die , if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals , you can be together as a family again .
the way that we 've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear .
in fact , my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation .
but i 'll tell you what my people have done .
but not one woman in that line will forget that day , and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day .
it 's time that half of the world 's population had voice and equality within our world 's religions , churches , synagogues , mosques and shrines around the world .
i did n't know when i agreed to do this whether i was expected to talk or to sing .
and the thing is that i have a stutter .
people think i 'm drunk all the time . ( laughter )
it does n't mean i wo n't some day , but i have n't yet .
tr : thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
`` who 's been there ? say , `` '' aye . '' '' audience : aye . ''
( music ) text : beatjazz .
but mostly ...
so class , hopefully you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the — ?
so you 'll remember , people of that era would have had an external electronic device , right , something like this , and they all would have carried one of these around with them , and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment .
so we 've got quite a few of these to get through .
now , i know some of you have requested the book in pill form .
right . please toggle them off . okay ?
okay honey , now , i 'm ready when you are .
what is he saying ? i ca n't hear you !
i 've heard of may-december romances , but what are you , about 20 years old ?
i think i have candies in my purse older than 18 years old .
no , well , i guess when i was a girl , we did n't really have a name for that either .
okay . okay .
all right ? you can say it .
pshh , you know how hard it is being a domestic worker ?
so i 'm not going to tell you that what i do , it 's easy , i 'm not going to tell you that i feel — what 's that you said , liberated ?
also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier , right ?
`` but girls , especially , were expected to be `` '' sexy '' '' while avoiding being perceived as `` '' sluts '' '' for being sexual . right ? ''
yes .
though it was not all bad news either .
yeah , and i totally believe in causes , yeah , like , all that stuff .
yeah , toms , like , the shoes , like , you buy a pair and then a kid in africa gets clean water .
but what was the question again ? sorry .
but also , you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them , but you can , like , kill them and take your money back .
yeah , this kid , i remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points .
it felt pretty terrible , actually .
no , i do n't think i said anything , i just finished playing and went home .
all right class , so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue . ( laughter ) the next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker , life coach and therapist , but if you want to know more about him , you 'll have to come to the entire play .
and he buys a piece of art that i made .
so i invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world .
`` and he makes it worse by saying , `` actually , i do n't have a place . '' ''
there 's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room .
maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered .
three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor .
`` it 's going to be huge ! '' '' ( laughter ) we sat back , and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off . ''
and it 's because of this that our company can even exist .
so now that you 've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing , i 'd love to share a few discoveries we 've made along the way .
and they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you .
what if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up ?
i see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation .
and they 've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups .
i want you to put off your preconceptions , your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles .
two animals , two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on .
this crocodile , which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers , and this charismatic snake , the king cobra .
this first encounter was kind of like the maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior .
and it brought me straight into the conservation fray .
this is an average size king cobra , about 12 feet long .
and they did n't kill it . they called us to catch it .
now , what are we doing with all this information ?
what 's the point of all this ?
and , just like project tiger , our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it .
it pours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice .
and what do we do ? how do we respond to this ?
north central india , the chambal river is where we have our base .
it is an animal which has been on the earth for just about 100 million years .
so , in fact at this point there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild .
the chambal river is an absolutely incredible place .
animals like the ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left , and it is also critically endangered .
but out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape .
and it 's a bleak future for them .
so , we can do it .
it 's not like the teddy bear .
this guy specializes in pit vipers .
( laughter ) ca : thanks rom . thank you .
i 'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie , and i 'd ship my film to san francisco , and lo and behold , two days later , it would end up on my front door , which was way better than having to fight the traffic of hollywood . ( music ) i did n't have much money , but i had time and a sense of wonder . ( music ) so i started shooting time-lapse photography .
and if you compare light energy to musical scales , it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
child : when i watch tv , it 's just some shows that you just — that are pretend , and when you explore , you get more imagination than you already had , and when you get more imagination , it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things , like the path , if it 's a path , it could lead you to a beach , or something , and it could be beautiful .
we just think of the weather , and even with the weather , we do n't think of all the many nuances of weather .
and so this is a very serious problem .
we discussed , in the prior film , some of the old things that we did , like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic .
and i 'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people .
at the present time , it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient , before that patient arrives at an emergency room .
mortality : 300,000 people dying each year .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is a heart attack .
and when it goes beep , beep , beep , you better do something about it , because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment .
then , look at that after three minutes .
well , he kept the balloon filled to block the artery , to simulate a blockage , which is what a heart attack is .
it 'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because , if you do n't , you 're in deep doo-doo .
we 're putting in a copper stent , and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks .
well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
and what we tried was this ; here is a device called the cadwell model mes10 .
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches — and there are 30 million americans who do — tonight : a possible answer .
stacy sager : but for christina sidebottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine .
( applause ) you see , the problem is , 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a means to treat it , and i think that we now have it .
we thought we could adapt it for the brain .
the device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage , which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around .
( applause ) i have three wishes . well , i ca n't do much about africa .
( applause ) so , to get quickly to my first wish — the brain operates by electrical signals .
i think she said it looks like a gun . a lot of people do n't like guns .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
for example , i asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent .
well , then let 's go to a simpler explanation .
however , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it 'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it wo n't be nearly as good a case .
`` there 's an old saying , `` '' just because you ca n't see something , does n't mean it 's not there . '' '' my work is — it 's a reflection of myself . ''
what made me do it ? at school , i will admit this : academically , i could n't express myself .
so i decided i did n't really want to be a part of that world .
( laughter ) so i was hiding in the shed , like that .
so i realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that 's huge .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now that is called the huf haus .
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
i noticed that the house was occupied .
have we ever heard of a dust mite ?
( laughter ) so basically i 'd completed the house .
so after i 've done the same thing , then i have to paint it .
i experimented with a — i found a dead fly .
( laughter ) but i would never do it to a living fly . ( laughter )
and i looked at it underneath the microscope .
and it starts to dry very quickly .
if i 'm not , it will end up looking not like what it 's supposed to look like .
and charlton heston is made of a floating fiber , which i took out of the air .
there 's no way a man can do that .
the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand , because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect .
well , i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this , because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of , you know , the beginning of people coming to america .
i wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle .
they go in with their own friction .
but i had to rig it with strands of glue .
( laughter ) it 's something i wanted to do just to show how i could get the symmetrical shape .
`` when charles darwin went across the atlantic in 1832 on the beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , `` '' these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . '' '' ( laughter ) you could not get a worse insult , and that from charles darwin . ( laughter ) you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and i 'll tell you why . ''
they are bird-blending machines .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it 's not going to help you .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
when you walk out of this room , you will be informed about vultures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vultures .
you see something a little bit different happening in san francisco .
how cool is that ?
so you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music , but it 's represented in a very different way , and i think that maybe fits with our understanding of rio as being a very multicultural , musically diverse city .
well maybe it 's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit .
the other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity .
strangely enough , i always get the same three answers .
`` one , `` '' because it works , '' '' which is a great answer ; that 's why i google , too . ''
what are the building blocks of a water molecule ?
i will conduct a couple of simple queries , search queries .
pretty good indication it 's not clint eastwood in the picture .
`` however , google did n't settle for that this time , they just thought , `` '' that 's racist and it 's a bad search result and we 're going to go back and clean that up manually . ''
me neither .
this man , a terrorist , blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in oslo , norway and then he traveled to the island of utøya and shot and killed a group of kids .
almost 80 people died that day .
`` and he told everybody , `` '' if there 's something that this guy wants right now , it 's to control the image of himself . ''
`` let 's see if we , in the civilized world , can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results . '' '' and how ? ''
of course not .
see what happens there ?
you need to identify your own personal bias .
david sibbet from the grove , and kevin richards , from autodesk , made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter 's ideas .
and this is our great unveiling for today .
`` father daniel berrigan once said that `` '' writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead . '' '' i think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts . ''
neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened .
some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence .
in mcgowan 's case , he was previously at a low-security prison and he had no communications violations .
this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed .
i had published leaked cmu documents on my website and the counterterrorism unit said that mcgowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them .
now , i know all of this may be hard to believe , that it 's happening right now , and in the united states .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i 've tried to get better at everything i tried .
of course , not all takers are narcissists .
and , unexpectedly , the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers .
`` in medical school , the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like , `` i love helping others , '' which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody . ''
takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs .
well , most people are matchers .
are you ready ?
( laughter ) his name is adam rifkin .
he 's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people .
[ so in all your relationships , you always have to be the giver ? ] ( laughter ) what you see with successful givers is they recognize that it 's ok to be a receiver , too .
`` when that role was available , nurses said , `` '' it 's not embarrassing , it 's not vulnerable to ask for help — it 's actually encouraged . '' '' help-seeking is n't important just for protecting the success and the well-being of givers . ''
so how do you catch a taker before it 's too late ?
there 's a personality trait that throws us off .
they 're more critical , skeptical , challenging , and far more likely than their peers to go to law school .
( laughter ) that 's not a joke , that 's actually an empirical fact . ( laughter )
there are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others ' best interests at heart .
givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy , who do n't have as much power , who can do them no good .
this is now operating energy .
i wipe it up with a sponge , and i put it under the running water , and i have a lot less energy and a lot more water .
and so , we wanted to know , how green could we be ?
we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent .
we also used straw bale infill for our library , which has zero embodied energy .
when it comes time to sheetrock , if you use ecorock it 's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .
now , if i had n't paid attention to embodied energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house .
she 's not a high-powered political staffer , nor a lobbyist .
davinia 's impact started a few years ago when she reached out to all of her friends on facebook , and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls ' education .
a global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state , a tribe or a nation , but as a member of the human race , and someone who is prepared to act on that belief , to tackle our world 's greatest challenges .
our work is focused on finding , supporting and activating global citizens .
now , some people 's immediate reaction to this idea is that it 's either a bit utopian or even threatening .
`` growing up in melbourne , australia , i was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never , ever stopped asking , `` '' why ? '' '' you might have been one yourself . ''
we were a really enthusiastic group of kids , and we raised more money than any other school in australia .
`` `` '' smoky mountain '' '' was what they called it . ''
and the best thing i could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change .
we had this dream of staging this small concert around the time of the g20 with local aussie artists , and it suddenly exploded one day when we got a phone call from bono , the edge and pearl jam , who all agreed to headline our concert .
and so this is what we embarked upon .
we could only think of one way .
this is about citizens taking action .
but how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens ?
global citizens like davinia helped persuade the world bank to boost their investment into water and sanitation .
that 's what always got politicians elected : to seek , gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests .
now , global citizens — they understand this .
global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe , increasing the frequency , quality and impact of their actions .
these dreams are within reach .
thank you .
and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
and this , in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equates to a $ 4.5 billion mining industry for singapore — a place that does n't have any natural resources .
now let 's talk about the first one , cells in dishes .
our bodies are dynamic environments .
we have three fluidic channels .
it sticks , it wiggles its way through between the cell layers , through the pore , comes out on the other side of the membrane , and right there , it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green .
when they get damaged , say , by cigarette smoke for example , they do n't work properly , and they ca n't clear that mucus out .
tends to be middle aged , tends to be female .
children are not adults .
they may not respond in the same way adults do .
we have engineers , we have cell biologists , we have clinicians , all working together .
it 's pretty exciting .
now let me show you our instrument .
it does something else that 's very important .
now , let 's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if i could take your stem cells and put them on a chip , or your stem cells and put them on a chip .
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
so how do we prevent them ?
it 's actually from yitzhak rabin .
the relations between the iranian and the jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive , starting in 539 b.c. , when king cyrus the great of persia liberated the jewish people from their babylonian captivity .
a third migrated to persia .
but even in modern times , relations have been close at times .
in fact , the current dynamic that you see between iran and israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the cold war than in the events of 1979 , because at this point , iran and israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region , and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners , they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors .
so israel , who in the 1980s lobbied for and improved u.s.-iran relations now feared a u.s.-iran rapprochement , thinking that it would come at israel 's security interests ' expense , and instead sought to put iran in increased isolation .
so according to indyk , and these are his words , the iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment .
but throughout even the worst times of their entanglement , all sides have reached out to each other .
a few years later , the iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the bush administration , a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting iran and israel back on terms again .
all sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
or was it as a mother of an autistic child ?
i was five years old , clutching the hand of my nine-year-old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on .
`` `` what is england and why am i going there ? '' ''
i 'm only alive because so long ago , i was helped by generous strangers .
i decided to make mine a life that was worth saving .
and then , i just got on with it .
although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees , there was a glass ceiling to our progress .
i recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage , or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home-working organization .
we pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break .
my interests were scientific , the market was commercial — things such as payroll , which i found rather boring .
and they then wrote code , usually machine code , sometimes binary code , which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re-punched , in order to verify it .
our late son , giles , was an only child , a beautiful , contented baby .
we need to stop shouting and start talking .
we 've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban .
sharmeen obaid chinoy : he tells me that children are then given months of military training .
ha : they teach us to use machine guns , kalashnikov , rocket launchers , grenades , bombs .
soc : i , in my research , have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and i think it 's a five-step process .
effectively , the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .
step five : i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda .
that 's why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
this is the venue where , as a young man , some of the music that i wrote was first performed .
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
the sound system was kind of decent .
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
and the music there , i would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it 's played , the setting , the context , it 's all perfect . it all works perfect .
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
it 's no accident .
it actually improves it .
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in .
it 's smaller than this .
and they 're a lot more reverberant than la scala .
that was bob 's last record , yeah .
`` and they 'd say , `` '' play that part again . '' '' well , there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers . ''
the effect is just electric .
`` ( music : `` '' rapper 's delight '' '' by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies . ''
musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
it 's more a social situation than a musical situation .
but now that 's evolved into something else .
( laughter ) and in some ways it 's like carnegie hall , or when the audience had to hush up , because you can now hear every single detail .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
our mission is to build a detailed , realistic computer model of the human brain .
and so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble , and we make a decision .
they are confused , and you can not make a decision .
he 's at home having tea .
( laughter ) so , when you walk up to a door and you open it , what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions , thousands of decisions about the size of the room , the walls , the height , the objects in this room .
does it have the substance to do it ?
and that 's what i 'm going to describe to you today .
it had to add to the frontal part , so that you would have instincts , because they had to cope on land .
but there are about a million of them .
they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
but it 's not just a symphony of perception .
it 's a symphony of your universe , your reality .
and when you think of the fabric of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? what is the pattern of the carpet ?
and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .
and when they get to the synapse , what they do is they effectively , literally , shock the synapse .
so you need 10,000 laptops .
it 's creating electrical patterns .
and then when we zoomed into this , it 's like a veritable universe .
there is a lot more to do to test these theories , and to test any other theories .
so what 's the problem , why has this chasm opened up , and what can we do to fix it ?
well actually , i think the answer is staring us right in the face : use computers .
but in education it looks very different — dumbed-down problems , lots of calculating , mostly by hand .
`` and another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math — like in this example here — and sometimes it does n't — like `` '' am i drunk ? '' '' and then you get an answer that 's quantitative in the modern world . ''
but now you can find out all about — unfortunately , my weight is a little higher than that , but — all about what happens .
so let 's zoom out a bit and ask , why are we teaching people math ?
over the years we 've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically . it 's part of human society .
what is it that we want to ask ? what is it we 're trying to find out here ?
that 's stage two .
once you 've done that , then there 's the computation step .
did it answer the question ?
and also verify it — crucial step .
in math education , we 're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .
instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four — conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .
calculating was typically the limiting step , and now often it is n't .
so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .
see , i think of calculating , in a sense , as the machinery of math .
and i think there are some cases .
that 's absolutely the right thing , for people to follow their self-interest .
`` so my usual question is , what do you mean by `` '' basics ? '' '' basics of what ? ''
i do n't think so .
this is just nuts .
all backwards .
see , normally in school , you do things like solve quadratic equations .
they 're not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
you can do so many more problems .
traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate , but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts , however hard the calculating .
why is this ?
and very , very simple .
very simple example .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
now i 'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future .
and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation .
now , of course , that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on .
so , if we run this program , this is what we get .
very simple .
let 's just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out .
we 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff .
( laughter ) this science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we 've had for the past 300 or so years .
so , it 's been a big , very complex project , which i was not sure was going to work at all .
but i 'm happy to say it 's actually going really well .
and it should be able to tell us that .
so let 's say we have a lab finding that ...
so wolfram alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
well , even starting from mathematica , this is still a huge amount of work .
you can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have wolfram alpha figure out what you 're talking about .
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming .
well , it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe .
well , the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
but the exciting thing that i 've found in the last few years is that you actually do n't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that are n't obviously not our universe .
i do n't know for sure , but i think at this point it 's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try .
( applause ) so , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk .
are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe ?
i think things like the rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level .
one of the things that defines a tedster is you 've taken your passion , and you 've turned it into stewardship .
other than the fact that they ca n't tell directions , and they have very strange breeding habits , how do you actually work with these things ? ( laughter ) what we need to understand is : what drives the political creature ?
now , the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time .
it 's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work .
letters actually work .
so , how are you going to write your letter ?
they do n't spend a lot of time dicking around .
most of the time , if they have an exit strategy , they should take it .
`` so , in paragraph number four , you 're going to tell people , `` '' if no one is providing you with this information , let me help . '' '' ( laughter ) animals do displays . they do two things : they warn you or they try to attract you and say , `` '' we need to mate . '' '' you 're going to do that by the way you sign your letter . ''
why is is this important ?
what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens .
( laughter ) ( bagpipes ) ( bagpipes ) ( applause ) ( bagpipes ) voice : now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
there 's nothing done to this image .
all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura , and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
teacher : and then , have you got it again ?
so , as sort of — i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave , so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
audience : whooooooo !
mm : fellows are really good at that . ( laughs ) ( laughter ) okay . now we 're going to switch back into the aurasma application , and what tamara 's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge , so that i can remember it forever .
the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ?
mm : okay . so , i 'm told we 're ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are .
the problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that archie does n't really understand .
but he does n't know whether it 's an infection , whether it 's to do with malnutrition .
he said he heard suspicious laughter .
`` but a young german doctor picks up archie cochrane 's exercise book and says to his colleagues , `` '' this evidence is incontrovertible . ''
and you know , with the future billions that we 've been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
well let me give you an example .
and it 's wonderful , wonderful work .
and just a piece of context — the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services .
then the spray dries . it turns into powder .
now unilever did this and it did n't work — too complicated .
we have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer .
and if you ca n't find the answers , you must be lazy or stupid .
there 's this one trial he ran many years after world war ii .
all the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .
cochrane understood that uncertainty , that fallibility , that being challenged , they hurt .
and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject , i 've been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject .
how far you can anticipate , what follows from it , what are the threats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
i think that — i 've said in the past , many , many years ago , before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda , that it was n't about fashion — it was about survival .
i mean , all the projects which have , in some way , been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle , in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life .
and , in a way , it was buckminster fuller who coined that phrase .
it 's another subject . it 's another conversation .
and in parallel at that time , there was a very kind of exclusive design club .
this is going back the mid-'50s , '60s .
so , something which in [ the ] '50s , '60s was very exclusive has now become , interestingly , quite inclusive .
that would be the answer .
if you take china , and you just take beijing , you can see on that traffic system , and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles .
how does it affect the design of buildings ?
and here , the first thing you can see is that this building , the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket , a kind of insulating garden , which is also about the celebration of public space .
and the people who 'd created it came back : the project managers , the company chairmen then .
`` so we humored him , we kept him happy . '' '' the image at the top , what it does n't — if you look at it in detail , really what it is saying is you can wire this building . ''
so it 's not a kind of sacrifice , quite the reverse .
one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish .
that reaches 21 kilometers into the sky .
if , for example , you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement , it 's the same amount of space .
and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance , which is a mesh of triangulated structures — again , in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller , and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity .
and what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building .
as hubert was talking over lunch , as we sort of engaged in conversation , talked about this , talked about cities .
you know , who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels , with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes , and so on .
`` `` '' maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening . ''
what 's the heart of this poem ?
do n't be trendy if you want to be serious .
this could be embarrassing .
so that 's one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ; you get the big one and if you do n't like that , how about the little one ?
now , this is a little illusion .
`` and another piece for the art directors ' club is `` '' anna rees '' '' casting long shadows . ''
the idea was — and it was a brilliant idea — was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city 's subway system so every time you got on the subway you 'd be passing a different poster , all of which had a different idea of what art is .
and the one that i did not submit , which i still like , i wanted to use the same phrase .
so just bear with me . we 'll go real fast , you know ?
so , you know , sustainability , small planet .
one of them is that every society has an ecological footprint .
it has an amount of impact on the planet that 's measurable .
and we , at the moment , in our society , have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this .
and , you know , then you get all the way down to people who live in the asia-pacific region , or even more , africa .
i do n't need to go into that .
and i would say that , at the moment , the alternative is unimaginable .
give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
you can also start to change what you build .
you can start to know where things are .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we 're actually using .
this is a bio-morphic building .
there 's a lot of this stuff happening ; it 's really pretty remarkable .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
well , the first thing we need is , we need leapfrogging .
and one of the things we 're really , really interested in at worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself , and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room .
`` like , i do n't know if any of you have seen the movie `` '' city of god ? '' '' yeah , it 's a fabulous movie if you have n't seen it . ''
you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .
that it 's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different , vague possibility out there , but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility .
but it 's happening all over the place , and these tools are part of what 's making it possible .
you get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains .
i mean , that 's a great design .
just to wrap up , in the immortal words of h.g . wells , i think that better things are on the way .
and this discovery profoundly changed my view on how i thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which i operate in it .
and it 's the complete opposite to everyone else .
all i did was codify it , and it 's probably the world 's simplest idea .
every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent .
here 's how apple actually communicates .
we just happen to make great computers .
but we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple , or a phone from apple , or a dvr from apple .
the others just worked for the paycheck .
the next 13.5 % of our population are our early adopters .
it 's because they wanted to be first .
in the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in washington to hear dr. king speak .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
she acquired a nurse 's uniform , and she snuck in every night to sit by my side .
i am six years old , and i do n't cry when we leave home and we come to america , because i expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and bazooka bubble gum , bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside , bazooka that we 'd get once a year in ukraine and we 'd have to chew one piece for an entire week .
my husband brian was also homeless as a kid .
this was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams .
this is the u.n. 's population data , you may have seen , for the world .
and the world 's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
one : fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet .
take away land speculation , price of land drops .
all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden , and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future .
fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
cities are the crucible of civilization .
it 's now more than 82 percent .
china 's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
now listen to this : every week for the foreseeable future , until 2050 , every week more than a million people are being added to our cities .
now these are my comrades in arms .
is that conceivable ?
and if that is the case , how come that it 's very hard to kill a city ?
very few cities fail .
we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions .
we 're going to discuss that in a moment more .
and the reason for this is because of networks .
heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc .
do n't know . we will discuss that .
there is a scaling .
the slope of that is less than linear .
there is an economy of scale .
it scales in the same way everywhere .
and here , they 're all plotted together .
just to show you what we plotted , here is income , gdp — gdp of the city — crime and patents all on one graph .
and you can see , they all follow the same line .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
well i do n't have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet — japan , chile , portugal , scotland , does n't matter .
on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities , showing that increase .
there 's walmart . does n't look very sigmoidal .
( applause )
here 's the key question .
has a systematic advantage over country 2 in infrastructures .
that 's not too good .
( laughter ) telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
country 2 , that has fewer telephones , is china .
country 1 , that has a longer system of railways , is actually india .
`` and which one is a democracy ? '' '' you may argue , `` '' well , maybe country a is china and country b is india . '' '' in fact , country a is democratic india , and country b is pakistan — the country that has a long period of military rule . ''
but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan .
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
if you made that decision in 1965 , the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution .
it 's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern .
actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
statically , china is a one-party system , authoritarian — there 's no question about it .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
they have increased the security of proprietors .
indira gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .
the indian government owned and operated all the tv stations .
this is a very impressive record indeed .
let 's think about the future : the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant .
i believe the government should do more , but nevertheless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction .
so clarity .
and i get out a red magic marker , and out of frustration just scribble this across the front .
and so i did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right , we 'll take pearl harbor and we 'll add it to los angeles and we 'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city .
so i 'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be .
i go down into the subway — i take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
right ? and now i 'm thinking , uh-oh , and the train 's about to come and i 'm trying to figure out what this means , and thanks a lot .
times square subway station : coca-cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising . okay ?
`` you 're on coke . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' you moved to new york with an mba , one clean suit , and an extremely firm handshake . you 're on coke . '' '' ( laughter ) ''
blah blah .
i 'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36 , which was only four percent of the population , so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men .
these things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers .
but i did n't want everybody 's data .
so i did n't reach out to any woman first .
`` and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , `` '' that 's impossible ! you ca n't explain consciousness . '' '' the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question . ''
but they probably do n't think of these opinions as expertise .
they 're just strongly held opinions .
and this fellow here is looking at the painting by braque .
which reminds us , as rod brooks was saying yesterday : what we are , what each of us is — what you are , what i am — is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots .
it speaks so eloquently to the problem .
and i 'm sorry if i impose some clarity , some understanding on you .
but i 'm not going to explain it all to you .
now , this is an example — one of many — of a phenomenon that 's now being studied quite a bit .
`` it 's one that i predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book , `` '' consciousness explained , '' '' where i said if you did experiments of this sort , you 'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes . ''
he did n't mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
it 's in the museum in north carolina .
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
i do n't think so . not a chance . but then , how on earth is it done ?
can you see it ?
can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
as a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of swiss cheese .
when you see the cube one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away .
so , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . blank .
this one because it 's so large and yet it 's pretty hard to see .
how many still do n't see it ? how many still do n't see it ?
thanks very much for your attention .
what i wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you 're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
`` harvard medical school once — i was at a talk — director of the lab said , `` '' in our lab , we have a saying . ''
i , of course , and all of us , are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives .
having end results — things that come back from the printer well , like this little business card for an animation company called sideshow on lenticular foils .
most people do n't realize it , because they 're invisible , but microbes make up about a half of the earth 's biomass , whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass .
for example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes — there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments .
some of these make logical sense , in terms of different temperature gradients .
just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was , we assembled all the data — including all of ours thus far from the expedition , which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet — and it totaled around 29 million genes .
so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes , components and life on this planet .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .
and we simply asked the question , if one species needs 800 , another 500 , is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system ?
`` so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those `` '' non-essential genes . '' '' but it turns out the environment is very critical for this , and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment . ''
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x 174 .
here 's an actual picture of what happens : the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation .
to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach .
we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .
do they now become a burden on the medical system ?
if you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between china and the u.s .
regarding cyberattacks against the american company google .
more recently , the u.s. government revealed that in september 2008 , more than 3 million people in the state of espirito santo in brazil were plunged into darkness , victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates .
moreover , the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .
however , if we 'd had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies , which give the advantage to the attacker , make the blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in europe .
in may 2007 , estonia was the victim of cyberattacks , that damaged its communication and banking systems .
( applause )
think about your week so far .
so now you have no choice but to abandon your car where it is on the highway .
and imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere if a collision actually happened , thousands of smaller pieces of debris becoming new obstacles .
this is the paradigm of the satellite industry .
satellites there are naturally buffeted by earth 's atmosphere , so their orbits naturally decay , and they 'll eventually burn up , probably within a couple of decades .
satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries .
there 's also mandates for those dead geostationary spacecraft to be moved into a graveyard orbit .
but neither of these guidelines is binding under international law , and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms .
they 're only in place to limit the future creation of debris .
there are some encouraging signs .
simply put , we have n't found a way to use space sustainably yet .
it 's up to us to keep it that way .
thank you .
some called it a pr stunt , others — a genuine act of giving back .
we were merging 9,000 software engineers with 1,000 creative types .
[ create intimacy ] studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers .
and what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions ?
but it realized quickly that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff .
and there they openly discussed their personal relationships — their own experiences of gender equality with the coworkers and the partners .
not a single team member quit in the next four years .
no masks ...
or lots of masks .
and that 's not easy in our everyday work lives , because the relationship with our organizations is often like that of a married couple that has grown apart , suffered betrayals and disappointments , and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again .
`` that kind of beautiful language only goes `` '' skin deep , but ugly cuts clean to the bone , '' '' as the writer dorothy parker once put it . ''
it reminds us that like great cities , the most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for — even and especially when their outcome is uncertain .
they are movements ; they are always imperfect , never fully organized , so they avoid ever becoming banal .
and these are also the qualities of what we call home .
thank you .
it 's gone , as is most of the old town itself .
since the ceasefire in late 2015 , large parts of homs have been more or less quiet .
other people do all sorts of jobs to get by .
architecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together .
but over time , the ancient became worthless , and the new , coveted .
and in turn , the coherent communities became distinct social groups , alienated from each other and alienated from the place .
we have severely destroyed cities , such as homs , aleppo , daraa and many others , and almost half of the population of the country is now displaced .
this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan , saturn 's giant moon .
it landed on the surface . this is pictures taken on the way down .
each is a galaxy , fully like ours or andromeda , which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us .
there 's scant chance of life there — that 's because there 's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron , the building blocks of planets and of life .
and we compare simulated universes like that — i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk — with what we actually see in the sky .
on the right hand side , gravity holds sway . einstein explained that .
and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we 've normally called our universe — the aftermath of our big bang . and here 's another picture .
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small , but we want to understand the very complex .
we clearly have to be small , compared to stars and planets — otherwise we 'd be crushed by gravity . and in fact , we are midway .
and it 's this science , which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world , but also transforming our world faster than ever .
indeed , catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure — error rather than terror .
`` it was what he called `` '' fine-grained relinquishment . '' '' he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits . now , that 's absurdly naive for two reasons . ''
we have to accept that there will be hazards .
there 's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun 's demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar , not just for 40 years , but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our earth .
what would they have seen ?
but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history , the last one-millionth part , a few thousand years , the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before .
change has accelerated as human populations rose .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization , but for civilization to survive , we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein — humane , global and farseeing .
so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city , now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation .
so next time you think about a vehicle , i hope , like us , you 're thinking about something new .
guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
`` honey is sweet because we like it , not `` '' we like it because honey is sweet . '' '' there’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey . ''
you have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet .
and it’s a good thing that there isn’t , because if there were , then mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
what we see with , say , chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .
this is the strange inversion .
and i won’t be able to say too much about it .
matthew hurley is the first author of this . we call it the hurley model .
he’s a computer scientist , reginald adams a psychologist , and there i am , and we’re putting this together into a book .
massive solution to the problem .
now , that 's for oral rehydration therapy .
so , think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .
how is that possible ? let 's go to something else .
so , let 's dial this back . that 's what ? fifth grade ? fourth grade ?
there 's a great show on american television that you have to watch .
that 's all it is . ok ?
here 's another puzzle for all of you .
the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe .
right . so what has changed ?
so example number one : the internet itself .
but they had an amazing freedom , which was they did n't have to make any money from it .
and your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along , at risk to your own trousers , to get it to the destination .
we turn to the person on the right , and we tell that person what we see on our left , and vice versa .
in rare but striking instances , a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble .
so , for example , last year , the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .
well this one isp in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way .
it advertised — the way that you might be asked , if you were part of the internet , to declare what you see near you — it advertised that near it , in fact , it had suddenly awakened to find that it was youtube .
`` `` that 's right , '' it said , `` i am youtube . '' ''
then , at moment number two , you have the fake announcement go out .
the north american network operators group , a group of people who , on a beautiful day outside , enter into a windowless room , at their terminals reading email and messages in fixed proportion font , like this , and they talk about networks .
so it 's kind of like if your house catches on fire .
( applause ) i was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers .
how does it really work ? it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless , metaphorically speaking .
at all times , wikipedia is approximately 45 minutes away from utter destruction . right ?
( laughter ) so what we see — ( laughter ) what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed , late traffic engineer hans monderman discovered in the netherlands , and here in south kensington , that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else , you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function , and one in which they are more human with each other .
they just did n't think it was the right thing to do .
it was an act of kindness .
they start off on all sorts of goofy projects .
so this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture .
and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .
`` and it 's no longer just a `` '' i do n't know . i could n't get there . i guess i 'll move on , '' '' but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online . ''
i 'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead .
amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been .
and that leads to the suggestion , maybe economic growth is almost over .
that last downward notch in the red line is not actual data .
you know what the growth in per-person income has been in the united states in the last six years ?
negative .
now the history that we 've achieved is that we 've grown at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period , 1891 to 2007 , and remember it 's been a little bit negative since 2007 .
now we 're going to change and look at the level of per capita income .
you 'll notice that in 1891 , over on the left , we were at about 5,000 dollars .
our economy grew from 2000 to 2007 on the back of consumers massively overborrowing .
consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today .
by 1929 , electric light was everywhere .
but the women still had to shop every day , but no they did n't , because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator .
here 's an early computer .
by 1960 we had telephone bills , bank statements were being produced by computers .
fast forward through the '90s , we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth .
so you get google , you get amazon , you get wikipedia , and you get running water and indoor toilets .
and when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura , and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she 's going to be ?
and that 's what we 're doing in our cities : living here , working here , having leisure here .
and that 's the evolution of the system .
what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes : the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway .
i 'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city , because you can not have empty places during 18 hours a day .
and these are the references from our ethnic contribution .
all of a sudden , the soviet union , they split .
the smallest park in new york , the most beautiful : 32 meters .
so we see a lot of this .
and they 're just so uncomfortable .
that you do n't do things , you 're afraid you 're going to be judged .
if you do n't say the right creative thing , you 're going to be judged .
and so i went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time , which i 'm very interested in .
and then many more steps later , baby steps , they 'd be in the room , they 'd have a leather glove like a welder 's glove on , and they 'd eventually touch the snake .
and when they touched the snake everything was fine . they were cured .
well meeting bandura was really cathartic for me because i realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we 've seen happen for the last 30 years .
and the hospital and ge were happy too .
and i thought a lot about , what was my daughter 's life going to be like without me ?
i thought a lot about , what was i put on earth to do ?
what was my calling ? what should i do ?
it would be really great if you did n't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it 's some god-given thing , and to have people realize that they 're naturally creative .
we 're the new technologists .
and there 's this loud , thrilling music in the background , this wild music .
i can tell if you pay your bills on time .
i 'm here to talk about what we should do .
or should we respect his privacy , protect his dignity and leave him alone ?
which one is it ?
so to get people warmed up , let 's start with an easy question — something i 'm sure everybody here has an opinion about : iphone versus android .
you 're safe . it 's fine .
( laughter ) yeah , that 's a terrifying result .
he says something 's just . she says something else is just .
if you 've got two of something , you add two more , you get four .
but do n't give up .
how about this : what if in any situation you could just calculate , look at the choices , measure out which one 's better and know what to do ?
let 's take an example .
that has a very high utility to prevent that damage .
and compared to the little pain that it 's going to cause — because it 's going to be embarrassing when i 'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit — that 's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
but maybe you do n't feel that way either .
it does n't matter what the calculations are .
it is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable tedtalk time doing nothing but thinking about this .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
why ? because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists .
just a few days ago , right across the street from here , there was hundreds of people gathered together .
and you 're telling him what we 're talking about , about our whole data revolution and all this — maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music .
`` we care what happens in `` '' apocalypse now . '' '' and we certainly care what happens with our technologies . ''
we 're the ones writing this opera .
anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
ab : 1824 , ok .
thank you very much .
they 're the largest of the tunas , the second-largest fish in the sea — bony fish .
they actually are a fish that is endothermic — powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal .
bluefin are pursued wherever they go — there is a gold rush on earth , and this is a gold rush for bluefin .
and yet , the type of fishing going on today , with pens , with enormous stakes , is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet .
bluefin have two populations : one large , one small .
we ca n't see the corridors , and we ca n't see what it is that brings together a tuna , a leatherback and an albatross .
it 's hard to study a bluefin on its turf , the entire pacific realm .
so the story of our team , a dedicated team , is fish and chips .
we 're putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before .
i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium .
they 're flying through their space , ocean space .
we 'd been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to husbandry them .
we go in the tanks with the tuna — we touch their naked skin — it 's pretty amazing . it feels wonderful .
and that tuna thinks it 's going to japan , but it 's staying in place .
so in a program called tag-a-giant we 've actually gone from ireland to canada , from corsica to spain .
a team of fishers , captains , scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes .
and this is my favorite .
that 's where the tuna wants to go — it wants to forage on schools of herring — but it ca n't get there . it 's too cold .
but then it warms up , and the tuna pops in , gets some fish , maybe comes back to home base , goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas .
astronomically , we 're calculating positions .
that is where the tuna spawn .
but there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature — warm colors are warmer .
we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues , blue sharks .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are .
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we ca n't see .
we 've got the capacity , nasa has the ocean .
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .
we can save the white shark .
in kenya , contested presidential elections in 2007 — we just heard about them — quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people .
the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80,000 soldiers , policemen and rebels killed every year .
at times , they are complimented by negotiated settlements , or at least cease-fire agreements , and peacekeepers are deployed .
the agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in northern ireland with cross-border institutions that link belfast and dublin and thus recognizes the so-called irish dimension of the conflict .
not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements .
changes and shortcomings in leadership , more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure .
a cold war is not as good as a cold peace , but a cold peace is still better than a hot war .
so what then distinguishes the israeli/palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other 's needs .
yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
( applause )
he was later , it 's said , the basis of the indiana jones character .
`` there was a young girl who stood up , and she asked the question : `` where should we explore ? '' ''
this is an explorer of the unseen world , martinus beijerinck .
the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information .
if you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter .
beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers — people like that young girl from beloit , wisconsin .
i dreamed of it , and that 's all i dreamed of .
`` and the soprano section is just full of hot girls . '' '' and so i figured for mexico and babes , i could do just about anything . ''
`` they opened their scores , the conductor gave the downbeat , and boom , they launched into the kyrie from the `` '' requiem '' '' by mozart . ''
`` so i wrote on my blog , `` '' omg omg . '' '' i actually wrote , `` '' omg , '' '' hopefully for the last time in public ever . ''
this is evangelina etienne ( singing ) from massachusetts . ( singing )
this is jamal walker from dallas , texas . ( singing )
`` i 'd like to be the person to edit this all together . '' '' i said , `` '' thank you , scott . i 'm so glad that you found me . '' '' and scott aggregated all of the videos . ''
someone did all eight videos — a bass even singing the soprano parts .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
( applause ) from malta , madagascar , thailand , vietnam , jordan , egypt , israel , as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand .
`` `` '' my sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly . ''
`` what i 'd like to close with then today is the first look at `` '' sleep '' '' by virtual choir 2.0 . ''
so here we have this incredible field , which has enormous hope for humanity , but much like ivf over 35 years ago , until the birth of a healthy baby , louise , this field has been under siege politically and financially .
this is an extremely new field .
and stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases , and it 's an unprecedented window .
and this opens up the ability , which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term , of using human cells to test for drugs .
it 's a terrible business model .
we 've got to look at the big picture .
`` they just say , `` '' well , you have feet , here are your shoes . '' '' it does n't work with shoes , and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet . ''
we need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types that represent who we are .
it 's here now , and in our family , my son has type 1 diabetes , which is still an incurable disease , and i lost my parents to heart disease and cancer , but i think that my story probably sounds familiar to you , because probably a version of it is your story .
and these are always periods , ladies and gentlemen , accompanied by turbulence , and all too often by blood .
mao zedong used to refer to them as the european civil wars , and it 's probably a more accurate way of describing them .
well , ladies and gentlemen , we live at one of those times .
but let 's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world .
now that suits the powerful up to a moment .
it 's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint , but the lesson of history is that , sooner or later , unregulated space — space not subject to the rule of law — becomes populated , not just by the things you wanted — international trade , the internet , etc . — but also by the things you do n't want — international criminality , international terrorism .
now notice , i 'm not talking about government .
if we did n't have the u.n. , we 'd have to invent it .
it needs a means by which you can legitimize international action .
you 're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
you see increasingly that the world now looks actually , for us europeans , much more like europe in the 19th century .
if paris got together with berlin , britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance .
is that we 're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years — i say 400 years because it 's the end of the ottoman empire — of the hegemony of western power , western institutions and western values .
but that 's no longer true .
now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our western friends .
`` people say to me , `` '' the chinese , of course , they 'll never get themselves involved in peace-making , multilateral peace-making around the world . '' '' oh yes ? why not ? ''
of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
they want to keep the sea lanes open .
it 's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging .
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
today in our modern world , because of the internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
but now one final thing .
it is no longer the case .
peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game could n't work .
so , what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning .
so , we 've built this idea of a commons .
connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
when this whole shebang happened , he was four .
he was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these , needless to say , uneatable concoctions , or making invisible macaroni and cheese .
`` it was like `` '' willy wonka and the chocolate factory . '' '' that thing was amazing . ''
what i did n't realize at the time , however , was that i had become an activist , i could change something , that even as a kid , or maybe even especially as a kid , my voice mattered , and your voice matters too .
i look out into this crowd , and i see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change , and i know that you can , and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in , and you can trade it across all these social media , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever else you can think of .
all that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants .
and so we were rowing , and one of these western grebes came along .
and what they do for their courtship dance is , they go together , the two of them , the two mates , and they begin to run underwater .
and some of them were very resistant , actually , to being there .
we use bacteria to clean our water . and we said , well , that 's not exactly being inspired by nature .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization — and then they all sort of leaned in — they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world — that 's the switch .
the plane you came in , cars , the seats that you 're sitting on .
how do we redesign the world that we make , the human-made world ?
it 's called heat , beat and treat — that 's what material scientists call it .
how does life make the most of things ?
in other words : structure .
as i 'm reading more and more now , and following the story , there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences .
the two groups are not talking to each other .
what 's interesting , again , is that it self-assembles .
down at the very base of it , there 's fiber optics that work better than ours , actually , to move light , but you can tie them in a knot ; they 're incredibly flexible .
here 's another big idea : co2 as a feedstock .
that 's a ball of water , and those are dirt particles .
the one on the right is a pill bug — pulls water out of air , does not drink fresh water .
what if we were to separate out metals from waste streams , small amounts of metals in water ? that 's what microbes do ; they chelate metals out of water .
there 's a company here in san francisco called mr3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes ' molecules on filters to mine waste streams .
it 's not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
timed degradation : packaging that is good until you do n't want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue .
a guy named bruce rosner looked at the tardigrade — which dries out completely , and yet stays alive for months and months and months , and is able to regenerate itself .
i 'm not going to get to 12 .
this is a huge and important one , number 11 .
in ensemble , that 's what whole ecosystems do : they create more and more opportunities for life .
that is not how you win .
so eric would have won . he was the first person to pin my thumb .
so i think we should kind of get some more involved .
we 're going to try and get all , something like , i do n't know , 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node .
and we have to connect both levels , so if you 're up there , you 're going to be reaching down and reaching up .
stand up ! it 's easier if you stand up .
everybody , up up up up up !
all right .
( laughter ) did you win ? you got it ? you got it ? excellent !
( applause ) well done . thank you . thank you very much .
you guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds , so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other . that is great .
all right . i have very good news for you .
the best way to become a legendary grandmaster , you 've got your two nodes going on .
as soon as you win , suddenly stop .
we 're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros .
those are important things , but that 's not how i wanted to spend my life .
computers control our military equipment , everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks .
on the one hand , it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves , but on the other hand , it means we have a whole new way to attack , a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
now , it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase , but that 's not necessarily true anymore .
binary information makes your phone work , and used correctly , it can make your phone explode .
but here 's the catch : this is hard , really , really hard , and here 's why .
when i have to do that , what i have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information , try to decipher each piece , and see if it might be what i 'm after .
it seemed to be about right , but i could n't quite tell .
so that 's what i did . i came in on a saturday morning , and about 10 hours in , i sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle .
but instead of just going home and calling it quits , i took a step back and asked myself , what went wrong here ?
so what happened ?
but i had this epiphany .
so what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information ?
so with these ideas in mind , i sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home , which looked pretty much the same .
so i poured through every book i could find , every idea i 'd ever encountered , to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different ?
what do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit ?
that 's incredible .
and the very first thing i want to do , the very first question i want to answer , is what is this ?
i do n't care what it does , how it works .
most importantly for me , this is what the code on your cell phone looks like .
so i know what english looks like at a binary level , and i know what its visual abstraction looks like , but i 've never seen russian binary in my entire life .
because i know what one language looks like , i can recognize other languages even when i 'm not familiar with them .
in seconds , we can pick out every pattern here .
all i have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when i 'm at similar pieces .
it can find all the detailed patterns , all the important pieces , for us .
i wanted to find out if this would really work in the work i do every day .
this is an image of some sort .
all this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally .
when seconds count , we 've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys .
when i was a kid , the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war .
we did n't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go , who would have gone , seen what the disease was , seen how far it had spread .
we did n't have a way of preparing people .
no one to figure out what tools should be used .
but that was never tried .
so here 's what would happen : it would spread throughout the world very , very quickly .
and you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic .
we should be concerned .
for soldiers , we have full-time , waiting to go .
finally , we need lots of advanced r & d in areas of vaccines and diagnostics .
now i do n't have an exact budget for what this would cost , but i 'm quite sure it 's very modest compared to the potential harm .
so i think this should absolutely be a priority .
so when you think of it at that point , all walls collapse .
this is what i call the earth 's biological horizon .
so was mars habitable ?
it shows the remnants of a delta , and this picture tells us something : water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time .
so to do that , it 's easy .
life is everywhere , absolutely everywhere .
everything you see in this picture is a living organism .
in this region , the u.v . radiation is really nasty .
and we do n't know yet if the methane in question is really from geology or biology .
so yeah , microbes are talking and we are listening , and they are taking us , one planet at a time and one moon at a time , towards their big brothers out there .
i 've worked in broadcast .
and i did , though , have a really great intern , a woman named michaela kobsa-mark .
and even though , through his peripheral vision , he can see that he 's in this lab space , he should be able to see that he 's not actually on the street , but he feels like he 's there with those people .
so that piece ended up going to sundance in 2012 , a kind of amazing thing , and it was the first virtual reality film ever , basically .
and when we went , i was really terrified .
and i really wanted to do something about syrian refugee kids , because children have been the worst affected by the syrian civil war .
( audio : laughing ) this has n't been edited ; this is him .
you are laughing to show people that you understand them , that you agree with them , that you 're part of the same group as them .
in our evolution , we have developed two different ways of vocalizing .
they 're really difficult for plants to produce .
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
so all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
and there 's an orchid that might look to you as if it 's got jaws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the insect to crawl out , getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else .
orchids : there are 20,000 , at least , species of orchids — amazingly , amazingly diverse .
`` they might say , `` '' i 've got a bit of nectar . do you want to come and get it ? '' '' now this is a plant . ''
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic does n't give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
they 're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that 'll have it .
so flies love this .
`` here 's arum , arum maculatum , `` '' lords and ladies , '' '' or `` '' cuckoo-pint '' '' in this country . ''
they drink this fabulous nectar and then they 're all a bit sticky .
now if you think that 's fabulous , this is one of my great favorites .
for anyone here from brazil , you 'll know about this plant .
this thing does something else which is unusual .
not only will it raise itself to 115 fahrenheit , 43 or 44 degrees centigrade , for two days , but it keeps constant temperature .
insects see green , blue and ultraviolet , and they see various shades of ultraviolet .
so there 's something that goes on off the end there .
now we do n't know exactly what a bee sees , any more than you know what i 'm seeing when i call this red .
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light .
it gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day .
but being one of 11 children and having 10 siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances .
it teaches you focus ; you have to talk fast or say less , because you will always get cut off .
so at the murabit school of international affairs , we go very heavy on the debate , and rule number one is do your research , so that 's what i did , and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders , who were innovative , who were strong — politically , economically , even militarily .
why were n't we learning about these women ?
myself and other women had a seat at the table .
we were part of decision making .
we entered homes and schools and universities , even mosques .
i used scripture .
and the only way we can do that , our only option , is to be , and remain , at the table .
i 'm an artist and an engineer , which is , increasingly , a more common kind of hybrid .
but i still fall into this weird crack where people do n't seem to understand me .
and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture .
so again , people discover their creative agency in this way .
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
so 70 years on , there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which , you know , l , m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this , and p , t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this .
so let 's bring up a video of that .
and in this project we 've developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
so all the text you 're going to see is real-time generated by the computer , visualizing what he 's doing with his voice .
okay . so ...
you can think of it as a way of , sort of , typing , with your eyes .
so it blinks one second after you do .
and inside it 's got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed , ( laughter ) from a friend . ( laughter )
for you nerds , here 's a little behind-the-scenes .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you very much . that 's all i 've got for today .
he actually coined the term cymatics .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
as you can see with your own eyes .
well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool .
devices like the cymascope , which you can see here , have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns .
for example , in oceanography , a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit .
we can also use cymatics for healing and education .
we can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature .
and we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature .
cymatics is accessible to everybody .
for me , i really love this idea .
( laughter ) if you come to my apartment and see my closet , i 'm sure you 'd figure out why : it 's a mess .
as we were talking , roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side .
when we were going in the car back to the airport , we were thinking : why was this so powerful ?
zk : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
( laughter ) now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
zk : now , our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole , and i have it right here in my pocket .
zk : i 'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
you can circulate it to draw the heat away .
zk : so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .
ks : for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
omc : i used to smell like you .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
and these dyes change color in response to odors .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
( laughter ) i mean , this is a true story . they 're using policemen as canaries . ( laughter )
but more seriously , they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans , and say if it 's safe for the firemen .
you and i weave together entire stories of people , places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them .
how hard can this be ?
even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model , and that 's just one object .
we went to the internet , the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created .
in both quantity and quality , this was an unprecedented scale .
as an example , in the case of cats , we have more than 62,000 cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats .
as it turned out , the wealth of information provided by imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network , pioneered by kunihiko fukushima , geoff hinton , and yann lecun back in the 1970s and '80s .
just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons , a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron-like node .
in a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model , it has 24 million nodes , 140 million parameters , and 15 billion connections .
so wait a minute . is that it ?
now , the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans .
( laughter ) ffl : we have n't taught art 101 to the computers .
let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again .
for the first time , human eyes wo n't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world .
this is my quest : to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for leo and for the world .
in the astronaut business — the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle ; it 's the most complicated flying machine ever built .
you are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself .
it feels like someone 's pouring cement on you or something .
and you 're holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
and then i guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior , your caveman reaction , and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb — or into your grandma 's attic or whatever , into your own basement .
and you can apply this to anything .
not just a generic fear of bad things happening .
so we came back , we came thundering back to earth and this is what it looked like to land in a soyuz , in kazakhstan .
yeah .
and technology has set us free — this is free wifi .
( laughter ) ( applause ) you will not like it .
( laughter ) now i should n't get into this .
religion and political cartoons , as you may have heard , make a difficult couple , ever since that day of 2005 , when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world — demonstrations , fatwa , they provoked violence . people died in the violence .
history tells us , they 've been used by the nazis to attack the jews .
and here we are now .
now you see me thinking at my kitchen table , and since you 're in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
you had a rebellion in the north , the government in the south — the capital , abidjan — and in the middle , the french army .
you do n't want to be the ham in the middle .
i went to places like gaza during the war in 2009 .
and i 've been doing projects like this , in 2009 in lebanon , this year in kenya , back in january .
so in lebanon , we enrolled the newspaper editors , and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page , addressing the issue affecting lebanon , like religion in politics and everyday life .
and that 's the message i try to convey to them .
today , tech companies are the world 's largest editors .
the problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand , and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple , when , in actuality , women are complicated , women are multifaceted — not because women are crazy , but because people are crazy , and women happen to be people . ( laughter ) so the flaws are the key .
so i was trying to figure all that out , and i felt a little confused , and i said so on my blog , and i said that i wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because i think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist , they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs , never being insecure , never having doubts , having all of the answers . and this is not true , and , actually , reconciling all the contradictions i was feeling
it dates to 850 ad .
what we can say already is that as part of the platform , you will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites , like this one here , and this potentially large one here .
it 's going to be launched formally by the end of the year .
it 's a diagram of the visual system .
and that 's because today we can see what 's inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons do n't operate alone , but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer .
and there 's several ways of doing this , but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies .
`` and only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say , `` '' hey , these are tools , these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette . '' '' and instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch , there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all . ''
this is the amino acid tryptophan .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it 's also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain .
oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups .
this sounds great . a lot of people agree .
some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business .
there 's just one problem .
but we 're not there yet .
so here 's where you come in .
might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet ?
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again ?
her cats , god knows how many , who must piss on her rugs — her landing 's a sickening reek .
`` the time it was chris connor singing `` '' lush life '' '' — how it brought back my college sweetheart , my first real love , who — till i left her — played the same record . ''
too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts .
`` `` '' behold me , '' '' the god of frenzied , inexhaustible love says , rising in bloody splendor , `` '' behold me . '' '' her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs , one agonized step at a time . ''
`` her whispering , `` '' thanks love . '' '' lightly , lightly against me . ''
would n't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds , so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away .
i was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control , and i 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench .
sometimes i 'd think i should take her home with me , bathe her , comfort her , dress her .
how enduring , our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished .
yes , the girl falls , absurd to fall , even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd , yet the girl falling is n't myself , or she is myself , but a self i took of my own volition unto myself .
`` `` special : big tits , '' says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand . ''
always that erotic murmur , i 'm hardly myself if i 'm not in a state of incipient desire .
the display was a photo . men and women stripped naked , some trying to cover their genitals , others too frightened to bother , lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .
sex and death , how close they can seem .
how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard , our passion to live in beauty , to be beauty , to be cherished by glances , if by no more , of something like love , or love .
and then it can assemble all these features into a map , like you see behind me .
that joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy , giuseppe can kill it .
( laughter ) in addition to building these small robots , we also experiment with aggressive behaviors , like you see here .
so in order to accomplish this , it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through .
so if you look at honeybees , and this is a slowed down video , they 're so small , the inertia is so lightweight — ( laughter ) that they do n't care — they bounce off my hand , for example .
and smaller is better , because along with the small size you get lower inertia .
along with lower inertia — ( robot buzzing , laughter ) along with lower inertia , you 're resistant to collisions .
and this particular one is only 25 grams in weight .
and it can travel up to six meters per second .
so from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms .
you have four robots — one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator , literally .
it 's because they 're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors .
and these shapes can be varying as a function of time , and you 'll see these robots start from a circular formation , change into a rectangular formation , stretch into a straight line , back into an ellipse .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
the second thing we can do is take models of plants , construct three-dimensional reconstructions , and from that estimate the canopy size , and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant .
as humans , we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value .
so what is the blockchain ?
it 's a composite view that 's constantly changing and being updated .
on the blockchain , you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets .
are they a power user ?
blockchains allow for us to create an open , global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source .
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority .
so all of these vendors , all sorts of companies , can interact using the same database without trusting one another .
blockchains allow us to write code , binding contracts , between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer .
you are financing that phone , but you do n't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met .
i think what would probably floor douglass north about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work , the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified , is our mutual distrust .
so a couple years ago , i started working with the folks that created that software , and we decided to pursue a crazy idea .
we thought , it 's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this , and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch .
those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see .
so what if we record them with a high-speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high-speed video , and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them ?
and like i said , we had to be very careful in these early experiments , so this is how it went down .
i mean , i 'm screaming at a bag of chips — ( laughter ) — and we 're blasting it with so much light , we literally melted the first bag we tried this on . ( laughter ) but ridiculous as this experiment looks , it was actually really important , because we were able to recover this sound .
and so here 's the video that we captured .
ad : and here 's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window .
but keep in mind that there 's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance .
so for example , here 's a video that i captured of a bush outside of my apartment , and i did n't do anything to this bush , but by capturing a minute-long video , a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation .
and ironically , we 're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects , when it comes to video games and 3d models , but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple , regular video , is something new that has a lot of potential .
back in the day , he made custom-made shoes .
he perished in the holocaust .
would n't it be awesome if you could , for the first time , get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and does n't require any hinge assembly , so chances are , the hinges are not going to break ?
so she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine , a little bit more elegant , and lightweight , and like good tailors , we thought that we would measure her digitally .
and you know what ? she 's not standing still .
millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today .
good for g.e. , right ?
but , you know , the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations .
it 's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3d printing that for the first time will make functional , usable modules that will go into it .
what if we could completely change the experience , like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3d printed ?
thank you .
let 's just start by looking at some great photographs .
but the harvard lampoon is about to come out with a parody of national geographic , and i shudder to think what they 're going to do to this photograph .
these are camels moving across the rift valley in africa , photographed by chris johns .
this is a rancher in texas , by william albert allard , a great portraitist .
photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today 's saturated , media world , because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment .
`` i can see his hands reaching out , and i can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , `` '' help me , dad . '' '' i got him . the wave broke over us . ''
`` i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me . '' '' ( laughter ) i thought i was a hero . ( laughter ) ''
but even more importantly , you need to know how to create a visual narrative .
this is a serval cat .
here 's a photograph shot in moonlight , something that digital photography has made a big difference for .
it was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
the herd was safe within the confines of the park , because of this dedicated group of park rangers .
this is actually one of the rangers .
i 've seen sort of ok pictures of bycatch , the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species .
jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .
and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
( laughter ) which just resulted in a fantastic photograph . ( laughter )
then , one fine day , mid-tour , i went to louisiana , a museum in denmark where i shared the stage with the writer colum mccann .
it was as i had suspected .
it was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience , and instructional how many others did n't buy my sense of self .
these are the places that shape my experience .
are you restricted by , say , racism , from feeling fully at home where you live ?
take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns , then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can .
olu , who looks nigerian , needs a visa to visit nigeria .
geography , tradition , collective memory : these things are important .
`` i go to accra every year , but i ca n't `` '' go back '' '' to ghana . ''
she is n't a citizen of the world , but a citizen of worlds .
and in the information era we all live in today , what we might call the ted age , i 'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that 's been fed on an incessant diet of internet news , of televised images , of cellphone videos , of email gossip .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
in order to have soft power , you have to be connected .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
and the then-communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury , not a right , that the government had no obligation to provide better service , and if the honorable member was n't satisfied with his telephone , could he please return it , since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in india .
the other day i was in kerala , my home state , at the country farm of a friend , about 20 kilometers away from any place you 'd consider urban .
so this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of india being connected .
but , of course that 's not the only thing about india that 's spreading .
and india is , and must remain , in my view , the land of the better story .
`` i had a friend , a history major like me , who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam , by an anxiously perspiring european saying , `` you 're indian , you 're indian ! can you help me fix my laptop ? '' ''
but , the issue is that when i talked about that example , it 's not just about talking about india , it 's not propaganda .
but , the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the '50s and '60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
and i do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about india , it is n't military muscle , economic power .
we ca n't really be both of those .
i 'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from malawi , eileen piri .
my father can not force me to marry .
no one in the world can force me to marry .
i 'll marry when i want .
i will tell you a story of two different girls , two beautiful girls .
my little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant .
`` there is this special day , which they call `` '' very special day '' '' where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls . ''
most girls end up pregnant .
for my little sister , she ended up being pregnant .
she 's amazing .
i knew what i wanted in life .
a hard thing to change , but a good thing to try .
`` ( applause ) so when the bill passed , we texted them back , `` thank you for supporting the bill . '' ''
every day , girls ' lives are being wasted away .
and another thing i would say is that girls ' voices and women 's voices are beautiful , they are there , but we can not do this alone .
what then happened , according to theory , is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation , comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to earth .
they probably also delivered complex organic material to earth , and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life .
the important thing here to note is that in the meantime , the four and a half billion years , these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system , and have n't changed — deep , frozen versions of our solar system .
there are actually two tails .
one is a dust tail , which is blown away by the solar wind .
the other one is an ion tail , which is charged particles , and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system .
we are only 20 , 30 , 40 kilometers away from the comet .
this comet had to be specially selected because a , you have to be able to get to it , and b , it should n't have been in the solar system too long .
in this case , that 's not enough .
then in 2011 , we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble , we could n't actually save the spacecraft anymore , so we went into hibernation .
to give you an idea , the average mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go ?
i wo n't bore you with all the details of all the instruments , but it 's got everything .
we can sniff gas , we can measure dust particles , the shape of them , the composition , there are magnetometers , everything .
these are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured .
now we know these from mars , but this comet does n't have an atmosphere , so it 's a bit difficult to create a wind-blown shadow .
you see it on the right-hand side .
the lander — again , lots of instruments , mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill , etc .
the boulder there is some 10 meters .
here , you see the whole sequence again , but from a different perspective , and you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet .
now , on a bit of a comical note here is that originally rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce .
so we 've been rather lucky that we are where we are .
it 's half the density of water .
one of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters .
ella is stuck .
this shows 30 years of intervention in that family 's life .
instead , the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families , keeping them stuck at its heart , exactly where they are .
so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella 's would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system .
and one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise .
and then some remarkable changes took place .
but today , she 's completed an it training course , she has her first paid job , her children are back in school , and the neighbors , who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them , are fine .
i joke , but i only half joke , that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb , no one will believe you till they get a cat scan , mri or orthopedic consult .
i 'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize .
and a woman comes in with a child , and conan doyle describes the following exchange .
and as a teacher of medicine , as a student myself , i was so inspired by that story .
and so when auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
`` and laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called `` '' the cylinder . '' '' later he renamed it the stethoscope . ''
so within a few years , in the late 1800s , early 1900s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis .
and , oh yes , if you wanted , he would give you a haircut — short on the sides , long in the back — and pull your tooth while he was at it .
would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient ?
i 've gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who 's in the computer .
the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america .
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
the discussion is all about images on the computer , data .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected — had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed .
i always begin with the pulse , then i examine the hands , then i look at the nail beds , then i slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node , and i was into my ritual .
and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which i had a role and the patient had a role .
`` i will be with you through the end . '' '' thank you very much . ''
i always wanted to be outside the box .
and it 's partly because i came to this field from a different background , chemist and a bacterial geneticist .
so , when your mom and dad met , there is a fertilized egg , that round thing with that little blip .
so how did his nose become his nose , his elbow his elbow , and why does n't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot ?
so for various reasons , we took this oncogene , attached it to a blue marker , and we injected it into the embryos .
now look at that . there is that beautiful feather in the embryo .
now , let 's take a normal example .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
so , you can imagine the amount of skepticism i received — could n't get money , could n't do a whole lot of other things , but i 'm so glad it all worked out .
so i said , extracellular matrix , which is this stuff called ecm , signals and actually tells the cells what to do .
we found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they got reorganized and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
( applause ) and in order to show you that the malignant phenotype i did n't just choose one , here are little movies , sort of fuzzy , but you see that on the left are the malignant cells , all of them are malignant , we add one single inhibitor in the beginning , and look what happens , they all look like that .
it has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
and i always say to the students and post-docs i lecture to , do n't be arrogant , because arrogance kills curiosity .
look at it . it 's constantly doing this .
on the left is water coming through the shore , taken from a nasa satellite .
do they look the same ? do they have the same patterns ?
and i spent about three years researching .
well , this must be the strangest thing i found .
`` and can you send me a bullet ? '' '' ( laughter ) and well , i did n't expect them to even answer my email . ''
`` so they were like , `` '' okay , we 'll put it in a jar for you with formalin , and you can borrow it . '' '' great — and then i did n't hear from them for weeks , so i called , and i asked , `` '' what 's going on with the heart valve ? '' '' and they said , `` '' well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve , because want his product to be associated with pigs . '' '' ( laughter ) well , the last product from the book that i 'm showing you is renewable energy — actually , to show that my first question , if pigs are still used up until the last bit , was still true . ''
in total , i found 185 products .
imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble .
but another , maybe even his brother , almost feels liberated , and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew .
it 's exactly the same event , but radically different responses .
what i 've done with it sitting still , going back to it in my head , trying to understand it , finding a place for it in my thinking , that 's lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime .
wherever we are , any time of night or day , our bosses , junk-mailers , our parents can get to us .
but it 's also , as you all know , a beautiful city encircled by hills , filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines , where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more .
i almost never have to look at the time , and every morning when i wake up , really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow .
for me , i like to think of it very simple , like a surveillance system .
but ironically , you can attend to something without being aware of it .
what just happened ? do you have a wallet ?
hold your hands together . your other hand on top .
like i said , it shapes your reality .
there is some science about this .
i 've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions , such as the one i documented in a village called budrus , were much more likely to achieve their goals .
this village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map when israel started building the separation barrier .
through inspired local leadership , they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
the separation barrier was changed completely to the internationally recognized green line , and the women of budrus came to be known across the west bank for their indomitable energy .
( applause ) thank you .
the first one is that i do n't believe women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men .
women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the middle east , but they tend to be invisible to the international community .
our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible in our news cycle .
according to the israeli army itself , 97 percent of activities during the first intifada were unarmed .
in our history books , for instance , and in our collective consciousness , men are the public faces and spokespersons for the 1960s struggle for racial justice in the united states .
but she played a crucial role in every phase of the struggle , particularly by emphasizing literacy and education .
if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .
thank you .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
now sometimes when people see this , i hear this gasp .
so the first time heart disease strikes in women and men , half of the time it 's sudden cardiac death — no opportunity to say good-bye , no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy , no opportunity to help her pick out a wig .
we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
`` as barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies , `` '' yentl , '' '' she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education . ''
bernadine healy , dr. healy , was a cardiologist .
and she questioned , she hypothesized , is this a yentl syndrome ?
and they 're just passed .
and this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world .
so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
`` she was like , `` '' nope . sorry . women are worth it . '' '' well there was a little piece of that women 's health initiative that went to national heart , lung , and blood institute , which is the cardiology part of the nih . ''
you 're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology .
they 're often not recognized , sent home .
where do women get fat ?
we 're doing this at the cedars-sinai heart institute in the women 's heart center .
this is a figure from an editorial that i published in the european heart journal this last summer .
why are there women and men ?
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner .
however , immediately as the story is starting , something amazing is happening .
( clicking ) now see what will happen when i connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders . ( clicking )
now we can take these sounds and build words out of it .
( audio ) jo : ... an animal ... assorted facts ...
i grew up with another language , and the same might be for many of you in the audience .
but what 's happening in the speaker 's brain , in my brain , when i 'm speaking to you ?
here we 're asking : how similar are they ?
now , let 's take all this information together and ask : how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my brain to your brains ?
so let 's be specific .
now , the exact same pattern , i can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word : sherlock , london , murderer .
in fact , we see that pattern emerging now in your brains .
this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information .
`` we took a story by j.d . salinger , in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party , and he 's calling his best friend , asking , `` '' did you see my wife ? '' '' for half of the subjects , we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend . ''
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
( laughter ) i am my connectome .
ss : that sounded great .
they extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse .
now , at this point , you 've learned the basics of neurons and synapses .
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
and if you put those two facts together , it means that your experiences can change your connectome .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome — an idea that you may find empowering .
without it , the water would not know in which direction to flow .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes .
and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain , to see mental disorders in connectomes .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains .
resurrection might succeed for the body , but not for the mind .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
and i 'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today .
( applause )
i think it was in my second grade that i was caught drawing the bust of a nude by michelangelo .
i 'm not on top of the class .
all my seniors knew me . i felt really special .
that 's my mother . i love her to bits .
she 's the one who taught me how to draw and , more importantly , how to love .
she 's a bit of a hippie .
my father 's a little different .
when i started teaching them , i said let me start doing this professionally .
so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home town , bangalore .
i caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards , but i got stuck . i got stuck at the third .
`` i ran up to him , and said , `` '' hello , sir . how do you do ? '' '' he said , `` '' what are you doing here , raghava ? '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm here to meet the prime minister . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , so am i . '' '' i hopped into his car , and off we went through the remaining layers of security . ''
the next slide i 'm about to show you , is a little more serious .
so , i tried going to the art store .
i 'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted and a little bit about my city , bangalore .
except , i even started painting dancers .
i started doing fashion .
i do n't think i 've succeeded , but they 've taught me .
and these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good .
`` so , one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys , and i said , `` '' how do you paint like that ? who taught you ? '' '' and he said , `` '' oh , it 's very easy . i can teach you , but we 're leaving the city , because billboard painters are a dying , extinct bunch of artists , because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them . '' '' i said , in exchange for education in how to paint , i will support them , and i started a company . ''
and , in fact , i started painting on anything , and started sending them around town .
i lived in india . she lived in america .
notice one thing , we 're equal here .
( laughter ) but this brought me — with netra managing my career — it brought me a lot of success .
i was really happy . i thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar .
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding .
i had the vegetable carvers work on that for me .
of course , my work turned ugly , but another thing happened .
but i wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut , because i was painting it from my gut .
( laughter ) anyway , i do n't know what my friends are going to say after this talk .
it 's a secret .
`` this one is called `` '' what the fuck was i thinking ? '' '' it talks about mental incest . ''
but i 'm very civil in my action , i assure you .
and , before i go , i want to tell you a little story .
and then i left .
for me , my art is my magic carpet ride .
i am a conductor , and i 'm here today to talk to you about trust .
there has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in .
( applause ) so in order for all this to work , obviously i have got to be in a position of trust .
you become a figure of fun . there 's no trust anymore , only ridicule .
i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms .
`` if you hold it too loosely , it flies away . '' '' i have to say , in those days , i could n't really even find the bird . ''
i heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers , the majority of whom were black , but there were a handful of white performers .
and that showed me such a fundamental truth , that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words can not .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started touring them internationally .
`` one of them was `` '' carmen . '' '' we then thought we 'd make a movie of `` '' carmen , '' '' which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha . ''
and yet , ladies and gentlemen , every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .
and what i 'm going to say to you now is i 'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence , to take the plunge , to believe that you can trust your ears , you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue , fiber , dna , what makes a great piece of music great .
i think we need to sing for our tea .
the music will start , and then at a signal from me , you will sing that .
you wo n't make the key otherwise .
but the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me , aside from her very existence , is that it 's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden , the community of disabled people .
so i find myself asking : where is music in all of this ?
you ca n't tell me that there are n't millions of disabled people , in the u.k. alone , with massive musical potential .
then suddenly , as if by magic , bang ! we 're all in there and it 's complete bedlam . you ca n't hear anything .
no one 's responding to each other .
i 'm 22 , and i 'm a left-handed pianist .
i become alive .
and we 're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now .
the reason that i avoided an mba program — other than the fact that i could n't get into any because i had a 61 percent average out of high school and then 61 percent average at the only school in canada that accepted me , carlton — but our mba programs do n't teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
they teach them to go work in corporations .
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
( laughter ) ( applause ) at least i can admit i cheated in university ; most of you wo n't .
and she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway .
it does n't mean you have to get through school .
well , i do n't think it 's either . i think it can be both .
when i was growing up as a young kid , i had no choice , because i was taught at a very early , young age — when my dad realized i was n't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school — that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age .
and i learned that you could actually negotiate with people .
and he would n't buy a newspaper from me ever .
`` i 'm like , `` '' but you have two cars and they do n't have license plate protectors . '' '' and he said , `` '' i know . '' '' and i said , `` '' this car here 's got one license plate that 's all crumpled up . '' '' and he said , `` '' yes , that 's my wife 's car . '' '' and i said , `` '' why do n't we just test one on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer . '' '' so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each . ''
but it was obvious to me , right ? buy low , sell high .
you 've got this demand over here that has money .
so i would collect the tips and get payment .
( laughter ) my dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop .
i asked him what he did with it , and he said he just throws it out .
and making money off that too .
so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown .
that if i land this client once , and every week i get paid by that person , that 's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person .
i would caddy , i would go to the golf course and caddy for people .
and people could never get their bags up it .
you just pick them up with both feet .
yeah , but you know what ? you stuff that down your shorts , when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free , everybody bought them .
you know we teach our kids and we buy them games , but why do n't we get them games , if they 're entrepreneurial kids , that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs ?
allowances teach kids the wrong habits .
come to me and tell me what it is .
and then they do n't have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negotiating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
they walk up with me . every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker .
`` it drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying , `` maybe i 'll start contributing to my rsp now . '' ''
my kids do that all the time .
those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing .
we have all these lessons in front of us , but we do n't take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tutor .
`` imagine if you actually took all the kids ' junk that 's in the house right now , all the toys that they 've outgrown two years ago and said , `` '' why do n't we start selling some of this on craigslist and kijiji ? '' '' and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in . ''
they can come into your account or a sub account or whatever .
it 's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .
what technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty ?
so the solution has to be , as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form , i think , early in the 20th century , that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart .
it was always a surprise that it happened then and there , but it was n't a surprise that it happened at all .
so we ca n't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost , one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio .
the most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers , and we 've seen , and i 've had the pleasure to invest in , companies that give me great confidence that we 'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale .
so given that we know and should believe — because moore 's law 's been , like , a constant , i mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
it 's great that we have initiatives to say , let 's go create the education and educate people in the world , because that 's a great force for peace .
and we can give everyone in the world a $ 100 computer or a $ 10 computer in the next 15 years .
they all need clean water , they need energy , they need transportation , and we want them to develop in a green way .
if we take carbon nanotubes , you know , iijima discovered them in 1991 , they just have incredible properties .
and these are the kinds of things we 're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .
in two dimensions , if you make , like , a fabric out of them , they 're 30 times stronger than kevlar .
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund , so this for us is a very substantial fund .
we need better surveillance .
we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
so we 're very excited because we think we can fund 10 , or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .
we ca n't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage .
so if you tie that — you have to tie that back with the law .
and finally , i think we have to do something that 's not really — it 's almost unacceptable to say this — which , we have to begin to design the future .
we ca n't pick the future , but we can steer the future .
i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism .
i was very fond of this space because it 's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own that is abandoned .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
this is a tunnel underneath riverside park .
the murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains .
you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching .
this is a tunnel that 's abandoned in hell 's kitchen .
this is the new york city farm colony , which was a poorhouse in staten island from the 1890s to the 1930s .
it 's very dangerous to get lost in there .
and at the same time , there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries .
there are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the world war ii era .
i feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way — before they 're lost forever .
( laughter ) evidently , wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes .
fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge .
they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage .
and my brain , thanks to my parents , has been activated to form images in my visual cortex , which we now call the imaging system , from those patterns of information , much as your brain does .
now , someone , somewhere , must think that 's remarkable , or i would n't be up here , but let 's consider this for a moment .
lots of hands going up , a moment , let me do a head count .
keep them up . i have an idea .
case in point : i came up here and — ( clicking ) — they would n't tell me where the lectern was .
so — ( laughter ) and the feedback for the p.a . system is no help at all .
now , listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel .
`` for your challenge , you tell me , just say `` '' now '' '' when you hear the panel start to move . ''
okay ? we 'll relax into this .
( video ) juan ruiz : it 's like you guys can see with your eyes and we can see with our ears .
jr : the bigger the goal , the more obstacles you 'll face , and on the other side of that goal is victory .
not so much .
when blind people learn to see , sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better , more clearly , with less fear , because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge , through any form of darkness , to discoveries unimagined when we are activated .
dk : three hundred and sixty-degree view , so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me .
it works through surfaces .
it 's pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that i discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
friction climbing does n't have any sort of hard positive edges .
the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock .
it 's amazing . the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest , regroup , calm themselves , focus , and keep going .
fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing .
one of the things in climbing is , most people sort of take it straight on . and they follow the most obvious solution .
rule number eight : strength does n't always equal success .
once you get to that point where you know it 's going to happen , you need to start thinking about how you 're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt — how you 're going to fall onto the rope , or if you 're climbing without a rope , fall to a place where you can actually control the fall .
`` chris addressed us , the scientists and experts , `` '' you have to be more pragmatic . ''
and at the time , i was a post-doctoral fellow in los angeles , after completing my ph.d. in france , where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted .
he listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
( laughter ) actually , the first results were very , very , very disappointing .
it took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
it occurred throughout the central nervous system , including in the brain stem , where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain .
they are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of dna .
and me ?
my hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord .
and i hope this enticed your imagination , because i can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur , but when .
thank you .
and this is a movement where — this is started by a psychologist in virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
( laughter ) i do not recommend this at all .
`` i love those experiments , but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i 've done is my most recent experiment , where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible , `` the year of living biblically . '' ''
the second reason i undertook this is because i 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of america .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bible literally ?
i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging .
so , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate .
he was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
but he 's still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
how was the bible written ?
if you 're ever in kentucky , there 's , you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .
and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that i did n't even notice , that i took for granted , as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong .
it 's a remarkable thing .
the sabbath can be sacred .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it 's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
so , they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts , helping poor people .
this one was very unexpected because , you know , i grew up with the scientific worldview , and i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces .
because you ca n't .
so we 're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation , globally , across all social strata .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is obligation — and an obligation to that availability .
it 's that reeeee-e-e-each out , the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop .
`` or , my favorite , the `` '' love you ; mean it . '' '' ( laughter ) nothing says `` '' i love you '' '' like `` '' let me find somebody else i give a damn about . '' '' or , this one , coming to us from india . ''
the stories that we tell — what we push out — becomes who we are .
and so that 's the request i have for everybody in this room .
as you can see , these works are about family planning , election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the people 's congress .
the six people in the photo are xia gang workers .
i found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions .
so i tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers .
lb : this one is about 9/11 memories .
this one is called instant noodles .
but then what ?
what i should tell you — what i should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little ted talks .
( laughter ) okay . okay . oh , well .
well you know , she calls herself black — she 's really more like a caramel color if you look at her .
yeah . but even so , a wonderful talent . ( laughter ) and i — you know , when i saw her , such a wonderful feeling .
it 's true . it 's true .
and congratulations on being such big makhers that you 've become ted meisters .
congratulations . mazel tov .
okay . sorry . so anyway , what i was trying to say is that i really love ted .
because , actually , i 'm a sophomore at college right now .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development — that 's my new title .
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
and if you do n't mind , privately now , in the future , i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology , entertainment and dominicans .
you know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know .
yes , i took german for three years , [ german ] , and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class , even in the un school .
never . he always , always treated each of us , you know , equally unbearably during the class .
so , there were the teachers and then there were my friends , classmates from everywhere , many of whom are still dear friends to this day .
but when they got older , when the time comes for them to start think about getting married , that 's when we expect them to realize , a little bit more , their own culture .
so , if you will indulge me , i will share quickly with you a bit of verse , which i memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age .
i want to hold your hand . i want to hold your hand .
so , all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another , there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme .
( applause ) thank you very , very much . i love you . ( applause )
i 'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
( laughter ) or we 'll be here all day with my childhood stories .
so amongst all the criteria i have , there 's two main things .
`` and then my other second set of rules — i hate to say `` '' rules '' '' because it 's art — my criteria would be the three h 's , which is head , heart and hands . ''
it 's going to be two years of studio work .
and i 'm going to create this in two years , and i have .
well the range is quite a bit .
so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you .
and this is 22 feet long .
this piece was great . this is in my parents ' backyard in arkansas .
and i love to dig a hole .
`` and in her most recent project , it 's called `` '' weather i made . '' '' and she 's making weather on her body 's scale . ''
( laughter ) and so what they 're doing — each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card , which they sell for 10 bucks , they drew original works of art .
those first two are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win .
`` this artist is gus weinmueller , and he 's doing a project , a large project , called `` '' art for the peoples . '' '' and within this project , he 's doing a smaller project called `` '' artists in residence . '' '' and what he does is — ( laughter ) he spends a week at a time with a family . ''
and he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is .
for this family , he made this still-life painting .
and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property .
`` and this one 's called `` '' lovelock 's nest . '' '' this one 's called `` '' mixtape love song 's nest . '' '' ( laughter ) and this one 's called `` '' lovemaking nest . '' '' ( laughted ) next is sylvia slater . ''
and this piece : those are n't actually leaves .
they 're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage .
( laughter ) the next artist is hazel clausen .
and what they 've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence .
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .
but the story is not about these chapters .
science can do things with and in a picosecond , but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second .
so many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once .
this digital now is not the present , because it 's always a few seconds ahead , with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
we might think that those younger than us , those who are born into this , will adapt more naturally .
attention is time .
the digital world cannibalizes time , and in doing so , i want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves .
thank you .
i 'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care , which is the patient , or , as i like to use the scientific term , people .
even doctors are patients at some point .
it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes , obesity , many forms of heart disease , even some forms of cancer — when you think of smoking .
they know what they 're supposed to be doing , but they 're not doing it .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .
but they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it .
this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth .
it 's an amazing notion .
this is a campaign from the american diabetes association .
again , bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
you need to connect it to their lives , hopefully not in a fear-based way , but one that they understand .
okay , i know where i sit . i know where i 'm situated .
it 's not just hitting us in our heads ; it 's hitting us in our hearts .
finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
but it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
but we have an opportunity .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet .
who among us would actually say that people read this ?
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?
this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
you can understand exactly what the benefits are .
every time you take a drug , you 're walking into a possible side effect .
blood test results are this great source of information .
they 're just not for us . they 're not for people . they 're not for patients .
this is the worst presented information .
what we did at wired was we went , and i got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports .
this is our one-page summary .
likewise , you can go over your lipids and , again , understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose .
so we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i do n't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
and this information is out there .
i 've been talking today about latent information , all this information that exists in the system that we 're not putting to use .
so , imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here , a carbon here , a nitrogen here .
i 'll show you another part of the book .
and in the middle , we build a machine .
can we read the books and predict your height ?
so we take the real face of a subject , we reduce the complexity , because not everything is in your face — lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life .
in these seconds , your eyes are watching , left and right , left and right , and your brain wants those pictures to be identical .
we 're publishing everything in a scientific publication , you can read it .
we just need this amount .
southern european , italians — they never fit in models .
so , one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome .
and it 's a revolution that can not be confined in the domain of science or technology .
and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time , we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry .
now what could this mean ?
not anymore .
not anymore .
people can be upsold on certifications and recertifications , master 's degrees , doctoral degrees .
there are three advantages , three benefits to income-based tuition .
but also to choose wisely .
this video is from uc berkeley .
but in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start , we 're cheating and using magnets .
but when i 'm really small , the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass , which is what causes that bouncy motion .
everything is onboard , and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it .
i was in the desert , under the starry skies with the sufi singer mukhtiar ali .
now we do the same with airplanes .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
and it opens up a map .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
another thing that 's actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
and so we 're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
thank you .
they think you 're , like , a luddite or a technophobe .
and your families have known each other for years now , and it 's become very clear to you that jenna is extraordinary .
they 're immune to a host of health conditions , including hiv/aids and genetic diseases .
she 's so smart , she 's now going to be going to a special school , a different school than your daughter marianne , and this is kind of throwing your family into a disarray .
what actually is crispr ?
mostly that 's been frankenfoods and all this other stuff .
so that 's a big difference .
and let 's say we went the sort of traditional route , and there 's our kid swinging on the swing , and frankly , they 're kind of a mess .
it is scary , and we hate it , and it needs to be done .
and there would be an awkward silence at the table .
`` so i take another deep breath , squat down to next to her , and say , `` '' hey , i know it 's kind of confusing . ''
so like many of us , i 've lived in a few closets in my life , and yeah , most often , my walls happened to be rainbow .
there is no harder , there is just hard .
my family , my friends , complete strangers — i had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people , and now i was turning the world upside down on purpose .
i was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long , but if you do not throw that grenade , it will kill you .
`` `` well , we 've never been there but we 've heard it 's fabulous . '' ''
`` jack is our favorite . '' '' and then one woman , stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support , to let me know she was on my side , she finally blurted out , `` well , sometimes my husband wears pink shirts . '' ''
take the armor off . be yourself .
those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful , trusted sidekick — something that would delight us , enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
so 20 years pass — i am now a graduate student at mit studying artificial intelligence , the year is 1997 , and nasa has just landed the first robot on mars .
i almost lost it this week .
we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
we looked at psychological involvement — how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?
and this is what we see when they use just the screen .
let 's think about some other domains , like maybe health .
and then it could help track that for you .
it could help you set goals and track your progress , and it would help motivate you .
one case was the robot you saw there , autom .
the quality of advice was identical .
and the longer you could interact with one of these interventions , well that 's indicative , potentially , of longer-term success .
when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world .
we 've invited a lot of kids into this space , and they think it 's pretty cool .
but how did that evolve for you as a thought , and end up being the ted talk that you gave ?
but i also had noticed that it was n't working .
the same thing happened when i wrote my book . i started writing the book . i wrote a first chapter , i thought it was fabulous . it was chock-full of data and figures , i had three pages on matrilineal maasai tribes , and their sociological patterns .
`` and part of my journey , starting on this stage , going to `` '' lean in , '' '' going to the foundation , is all about being more open and honest about those challenges , so that other women can be more open and honest , and all of us can work together towards real equality . ''
ss : after i did the ted talk , what happened was — you know , i never really expected to write a book , i 'm not an author , i 'm not a writer , and it was viewed a lot , and it really started impacting people 's lives .
and so she watched this ted talk , and she went back the next day , she took the job , she went home , and she handed her husband the grocery list . ( laughter ) and she said , i can do this .
so what did that feel like , and become like in your life ?
now i know there are n't a lot of men here , but bear with me .
( laughter ) that is what audiences have said in every country in the world , and it 's deeply supported by the data .
one of the happiest moments i had in this whole journey is , after the book came out , i stood on a stage with john chambers , the ceo of cisco .
that 's the kind of change we have to hope for .
and yet the book is being read , as you say , in rural and developing countries .
and it turns out , everywhere in the world , women need more self-confidence , because the world tells us we 're not equal to men .
since i gave my ted talk and published my book , another year of data came out from the u.s. census .
if you are a latina , we 're at 54 cents .
( applause )
the wind will move feathers on their back , which will drive their feet .
`` there are not that many things on earth that are `` '' almost everything . '' '' productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society . ''
from '73 to '83 : three percent per annum .
notably , if you compare them to an average team , say , the french team , ( laughter ) based on their best performances in the 100-meter race , if you add the individual times of the us runners , they arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the french team .
based on their best performance this year , they arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the french team , based on the data .
so , there are 3.5 billion women on earth .
( video : french sportscasters narrate race ) ( video : race narration ends ) yves morieux : so what happened ?
accountability .
but we 'll never win the race .
so you have to recognize the voice of your colleague .
but business has become much more complex .
and the more business gets complex , the more , in the name of clarity , accountability , measurement we multiply structures , processes , systems .
is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not , if , when they cooperate , they are individually worse off ?
why would they cooperate ?
when we blame personalities instead of the clarity , the accountability , the measurement , we add injustice to ineffectiveness .
remove the interfaces , the middle offices — all these complicated coordination structures .
`` the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , `` '' leymah , take my daughter . ''
and all day she walked around only in her underwear .
`` her mother died while giving birth to her , and no one had any idea who her father was . '' '' for two weeks , she became my companion , slept with me . ''
every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor .
she 's highly athletic .
other countries come with different things .
in liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
`` and then someone asked me , just before my tedtalk , a few days ago , `` so where is the hope ? '' ''
it 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls ' kids are totally out there and no hope , or seemingly no hope .
we created a space called the young girls transformative project .
when these girls sit , you unlock intelligence , you unlock passion , you unlock commitment , you unlock focus , you unlock great leaders .
i wish for food for my children .
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry .
i failed to do this .
this young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her .
we 're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential .
as part of my work , i 'm doing these tours in different villages and towns — 13 , 15 hours on dirt roads — and there is no community that i 've gone into that i have n't seen intelligent girls .
`` these little girls turned to him and said , `` we will vote you out of office . '' ''
he 's out of office today .
when i literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom , it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people .
`` so i thought , `` '' i wonder what 'll happen if i put the two together ? '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years . ''
i literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom .
the harvard men never ask that question .
and the sad fact is that at any given time , more than one in five americans will report that they 're lonely .
and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage , so the second big lesson that we learned is that it 's not just the number of friends you have , and it 's not whether or not you 're in a committed relationship , but it 's the quality of your close relationships that matters .
high-conflict marriages , for example , without much affection , turn out to be very bad for our health , perhaps worse than getting divorced .
it was how satisfied they were in their relationships .
and the people in relationships where they feel they really ca n't count on the other one , those are the people who experience earlier memory decline .
and those good relationships , they do n't have to be smooth all the time .
it 's also lifelong . it never ends .
so , you 're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries .
i 've seen this firsthand over and over again .
it 's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees celsius .
he stands there , and he looks across at the island , sado .
`` as he was nearing his death , his disciples and followers kept asking him , `` '' what 's the secret ? ''
and the last is that these bold , new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet , our oceans , and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet , for what it 's worth .
if you can see the complexity , you can see how tiny , little eddies and large eddies and the motion — this is just sea surface temperature , but it 's immensely complicated .
and i share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time .
`` well , marcel proust has this wonderful saying that , `` '' the real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory , but possibly in having new sets of eyes , '' '' new ways of seeing things , a new mindset . ''
on the left hand side , there 's a new type of mooring , which i 'll show you in just a second .
and the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them .
you can see the copper tips on these things .
and the cables go really continent to continent .
bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating .
climate change , ocean acidification , dissolved oxygen , carbon cycle , coastal upwelling , fishing dynamics — the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume .
so anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place .
this is what it actually looks like .
and these are the things that we 're funded to do today .
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?
as a result of the human genome process , we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean — like an erupting volcano , or something of that sort — can actually be sampled .
we have a way of addressing that , a new way of addressing that .
this is doable . all the pieces are there .
some doctors in new york city removed the gallbladder of a woman in france .
this — i 've shown you sea floor — but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
`` at the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for , but heard , half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea . '' '' thank you . ''
however , the problem with micrornas is that we can not use existing dna-based technology to detect them in a reliable way , because they are very short sequences of nucleotides , much smaller than dna .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we 've shown it in public .
and then , when this entire process is over , this is what happens .
then , if we take this specific pattern of microrna of this person 's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microrna patterns with a specific presence of a disease , this is how pancreatic cancer looks like .
if we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer , we need to stop treating them as acute , isolated episodes , and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis .
( applause )
my mother said that she thought i 'd really rather have a blue balloon .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter .
there are vertical identities , which are passed down generationally from parent to child .
and while some of them can be difficult , there 's no attempt to cure them .
and his mother said she was n't going to do it .
and she took her son home .
they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center — two classrooms that they started with a few other parents — to educate kids with d.s .
a compound that has been tested in mice , bmn-111 , is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene .
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we validate in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
`` and i said , `` '' if dylan were here now , do you have a sense of what you 'd want to ask him ? '' '' and his father said , `` '' i sure do . ''
`` `` '' so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i 've decided that it would not have been better for me . '' '' i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting . ''
if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children — more polite , funnier , nicer , smarter — i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle .
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they wo n't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly .
but i 'm not sure i would have noticed that if i had n't been so in the thick of this research project of mine .
and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was interviewing were fools , enslaving themselves to a lifetime 's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery , i realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that i was ready to join them on their ship .
your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
i learned about sharing . i learned about camaraderie .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
they stay because you want to stay in your home .
fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women , which is fantastic , and there 's also within the national constitution now , you 're actually not allowed to say hutu or tutsi .
so when people ask me how i continue to cover war , and why i continue to do it , this is why .
he tried to negotiate syria and could n't do it .
a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world .
from there i started with skydiving .
with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance .
the special thing on these three jumps were , i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day .
you need to have the best possible equipment .
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
ue : usually i 'm wearing a helmet . in the mountains i 'm always wearing a helmet because of landings — usually it 's difficult — it 's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings .
( laughter ) i did n't know i was a narcissist actually .
and of course we live in a society that 's all about contradicting other peoples ' reality .
and they got very upset .
emily levine : richard . what did i say ?
( laughter ) richard . yes but it 's also the head , the head of the conference .
`` `` '' the act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her , was the kind of rapture she wanted . ''
it was an act of clenched teeth and hatred . it was the unendurable .
`` the agony as an act of passion . '' '' so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor . ''
bad enough we had to see j. edgar hoover in a dress .
you make yourself the active voice .
basically , they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash .
and i was looking for a form that did n't have that .
( laughter ) i do , because at least there you stood a chance . you know ?
`` so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said , `` you sound sexy . '' ''
( laughter ) he hung up on me ! ( laughter )
and that 's really what i 'm looking for .
i mean he had laid it all out .
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly .
`` and i said , `` '' well , that 's how you know only stupid people go into it . '' '' ( laughter ) it only takes two years to learn how to talk . ( laughter ) ''
and this is instead of contradiction .
`` `` '' oh no . thanks though , i 'll leave them here . thanks very much . ''
and the mother is elderly .
and the mother goes right through a red light .
`` and the daughter says , as tactfully as possible , `` mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ? '' ''
that completes the quadruple .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you 'll be on the wavelength of your audience .
so let 's begin with a group of images .
we had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
well , i think what is far worse is man 's destructive power over man .
news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest .
in fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
`` ansel adams said , and i 'm going to disagree with him , `` you do n't take a photograph , you make it . '' ''
i think it 's going to be older people .
but just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result .
but the second challenge is tougher , because it 's about us .
first , do n't do drugs .
chris anderson : ethan , congrats — quite the reaction .
they get a bad rap .
but i think they 're beautiful , do n't you ?
they can be 200 miles an hour , 300 miles an hour .
to be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail , to feel connected to our atmosphere .
( applause )
it 's already fueled conflicts in chad and darfur .
and these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by brad pitt and make it right for the hard-hit ninth ward .
imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
oxfam and swiss re , together with rockefeller foundation , are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water , but they 're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come .
it 's giving them access to affordable credit .
other examples to consider . in the u.k. , the thames barrier protects london from storm surge .
the asian cities climate [ change ] resilience network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves .
why ? well , there are no experts .
we 're operating outside the bounds of co2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
but we 've been much more reticent , much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition , in emotion , in consciousness in other animals .
they 're emotional . they 're aware .
in the 1980s , i developed an underwater keyboard .
what i wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control .
pg : so groom was the subject of the piece .
( music ) she discovers a note she likes , finds the octave .
vint cerf : ( laughs ) ( laughter ) ng : speaking as one .
in the daytime they live outside . it 's nighttime there now .
and the third user group , in thailand , is think elephants . go ahead , josh .
so we 're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant , put food into the elephant 's mouth , show people what 's going on inside their mouths , and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are .
you 've been using the experimental version for the last 30 years .
and what you 've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species , that these other intelligent , sentient species should be part of the system too .
what that means is that what we 're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
i can hardly wait .
what 's special about it ?
jc : right , and then on a practical level , which technologies are you looking at first ?
but here we are , 20 years on , and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad , not hal .
but as we enter the era of big data , of network systems , of open platforms , and embedded technology , i 'd like to suggest it 's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time .
this is a world-changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease .
non-technical , non-biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein , allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues .
last year , on the site of the twin towers , the 9/11 memorial opened .
when first reported by the media , full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the new york city design firm local projects . the truth is a bit more nuanced .
so if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis , what can you do ?
the imperative is not to figure out how to compute , but what to compute . how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale ?
`` when paypal was first starting as a business , their biggest challenge was not , `` '' how do i send money back and forth online ? '' '' it was , `` '' how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime ? '' '' why so challenging ? because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns , they ca n't learn to do that based on patterns they 've never seen before , and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience : brilliant people , relentlessly resourceful , entrepreneurial spirit — ( laughter ) — and one huge and important difference : purpose . ''
`` it turns out that al qaeda , too , is not without its bureaucracy . ( laughter ) they answered questions like , `` '' who recruited you ? '' '' `` what 's your hometown ? '' `` what occupation do you seek ? '' ''
twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from libya , 50 percent of those from a single town in libya , hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent . it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al qaeda , abu yahya al-libi , a senior cleric in the libyan islamic fighting group .
perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists .
one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling .
the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information , social media data and relief organization information to answer this question .
we 're more than 50 years into licklider 's vision for the future , and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century 's hardest problems , man and machine in cooperation together .
i hope he 's all right .
in fact , it rotated first to the left .
so we collaborate with svein kleiven 's group in sweden .
so you can see this does n't look a lot like the cdc video .
now , the colors that you 're looking at are how much the brain tissue is being stretched .
we have the right brain and the left brain .
and the key thing to notice in this figure here is that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain there 's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain .
so what we 're learning is indeed consistent .
this stuntman does not have a helmet .
so i hope to come back in a few years with the final story , but for now i will tell you , please do n't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion .
the divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist , where we have offline attacks like those in paris appropriated for online hacks .
`` and we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships on and offline , we can support and educate the next generation of hackers , like myself , instead of saying , `` '' you can either be a criminal or join the nsa . '' '' that matters today . ''
it 's profitable and valuable to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age , and will only be more so in future generations to come .
but we still ca n't ignore government , because that 's who we turn to for collective action to keep us safe and secure .
`` but we see where that 's gotten us so far , where there 's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict , where at the highest levels of leadership , the director of the cia , secretary of defense , they say , `` '' cyber pearl harbor will happen . '' '' `` `` cyber 9/11 is imminent . '' '' but this only makes us more fearful , not more secure . ''
capabilities are cheap , even free .
giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that , yeah , they ca n't spy on us , but neither can the chinese or that hacker in estonia a generation from now .
i mean , it 's crucified .
its liver expands by eight times .
suffice to say it 's like — it 's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .
it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage .
i 'm just here to give the geese what they want .
he kept going like this to me .
so i hushed my voice .
so he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .
they ate , and he showed me on a chart , how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers .
and the irony of ironies is because extremadura , the area — what does extremadura mean ?
a big part of his income for his farm .
you want to look and see what good foie gras is , it 's got to be bright yellow .
and the geese love the lupin bush .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
and we 're sitting there , and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance , so i look over .
`` `` shush , watch this . '' ''
`` and i look at eduardo , who 's near tears looking at this , and i say , `` '' you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ? '' '' and he says , `` '' no , no , no . ''
i finally got to taste it before i left .
and the problem with saying that , of course , is that you know , at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .
there 's 100 percent star anise in there .
`` and he says , `` '' no . '' '' and i ended up like going down the spices , and finally , it was like , ok , salt and pepper , thinking he 's salted and peppered his liver . ''
he does n't need salt and pepper .
by accident . they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz . gotten sick of the chicken fat . they were looking for an alternative . and they saw in the fall that there was this natural ,
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he started demanding it .
and they invented , what ? gavage .
it 's the history of what we eat today .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
that 's serendipitous .
( mosquito buzzing ) ( swat ) gotcha .
now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing , because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin , but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed .
and we found some remarkable differences .
in fact , it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans .
my third story is perhaps even more remarkable , and , i should say , has never been shown to the public until today .
( applause ) now — ( laughter ) — maastricht , be prepared .
and why do i say that ?
and what happens if somebody wanted to attack this ?
one is short-range wireless , where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby , either through bluetooth or wi-fi , and the other is long-range , where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network , or through one of the radio stations .
okay , so think of that as , someone gets to go to your car , they get to mess around with it , and then they leave , and now , what kind of trouble are you in ?
they videotaped people on a bus , and then they post-processed the video .
they put a smartphone next to a keyboard , and they had people type , and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing to measure the change in the accelerometer reading to determine what the person had been typing .
now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing , and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning to have a training phase , and so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things , and to learn , to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer .
a human 's not going to think it 's the supreme might .
again , the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara .
so we can ask : what is compassion comprised of ?
and if we 're so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
`` in buddhism , we say , `` '' it takes a strong back and a soft front . '' '' it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions . ''
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
we also have our own unconscious biases .
and that 's not a good experience , to leave a gallery like that .
no ! you select .
of course not , you can be selective . it 's expected .
i choose a painting . it might just be one painting in 50 .
`` the first one needs little introduction — `` '' girl with a pearl earring '' '' by johannes vermeer , 17th-century dutch painter . ''
i first saw it when i was 19 , and i immediately went out and got a poster of it , and in fact i still have that poster . 30 years later it 's hanging in my house .
we do n't know very much about vermeer , but the little bits that we do know , one thing we know is that he married a catholic woman , they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he — his studio . he also had 11 children .
she 's in the studio with him for a long time .
these paintings took a long time to make .
`` he 's a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , `` '' look at me . i want to warn you about what you 're about to go through . please look at me . '' '' and he never does . ''
he 's not happy , and why is n't he happy ?
and you know what it makes me think of , is it 's sort of snug and puffy ; it 's like a duvet spread over a bed .
it 's short .
perhaps that was the intention .
he should not have been surprised .
so an entire philosophy , a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries , goes away .
so for the last 20 years , since my dental experience , i have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people .
so i took this picture three days after she arrived , and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on , with her toes sticking out .
so i was in dharamsala meeting these people , and i 'd spent about five weeks there , and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala .
and what he said was : treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels , because it 's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment .
that hit me so hard , telling these people that had been through this experience .
if you think about this man , 46 years later , still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue .
you know , violence as a political tool is all the rage right now .
( laughter ) one of the things i did just before 9/11 — august of 2001 — i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
and he brought a soccer ball , and we had soccer every night in this little village .
and all the security issues they cause us .
and we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about .
and just this last year we 've taken a group of teenagers in , and this has worked the best .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
and for me it 's just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she 'll demand a whole world — a whole world — to live on .
the breeze passes through them .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
how many people times how much water .
these are compost toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
the sidewalks are gravel . they flood when it rains , but they 're green .
these young ladies are living in a rice culture , but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .
when i see them together , i know that they 're working out how to live in the future .
green school is going into its third year with 160 children .
the kids love it .
and people are coming forward from all over the world to support the balinese scholarship fund , because these kids will be bali 's next green leaders .
but what 's happening , our learning-different kids — dyslexic — we 've renamed them prolexic — are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful classrooms .
and balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers , selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques , mostly by hand .
and if you 're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next 50 around the world , please come and see us .
this is a real thing .
`` now , i went one step further and said , `` '' why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document ? let 's go online . '' '' and many people might need help in computation . ''
`` and what about terms like `` '' over the limit '' '' ? ''
and one of the things i 'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm .
it 's a grid , it 's a calendar .
each year , one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the irs .
it 's incumbent upon us , and this organization , i believe , to make clarity , transparency and empathy a national priority .
you could be in new york .
so when the average american consumes 43 times as much as the average african , we 've got to think that consumption is an issue .
in 2000 , we had six billion people on the planet .
you do n't .
from a greenhouse gas perspective , is lamb produced in the u.k .
we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it , because it does , it fundamentally does .
these are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view .
this is nine of them .
in fact , these names start coming up over and over again .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
we need to begin to work with industries .
we eventually got , i think , 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table .
in the last 18 months , we 've signed agreements with 40 of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain .
one company we 're working with that 's begun — in baby steps , perhaps — but has begun this journey on sustainability is cargill .
they 've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that 's already degraded .
they 're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified under a credible certification program .
what they 've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
the rest of the land can be used for something else .
this is called bundling . it 's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .
we ca n't just focus on identifying the best ; we 've got to move the rest .
how 's your genome today ? have you thought about it lately ?
and one thing that is common to all of life is dna .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you 're from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that 's now starting to be understood .
and that may not sound very intuitive , but let me flip over to something else you know about , and that 's computers .
everything that happens in digital is converted , or a representation , of a one and a zero .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we 've been able to create with just a one and a zero .
we are starting to understand that .
they 're going to make all that stuff go away .
so , what can we do with genomes now that we can read them , now that we 're starting to have the book of life ?
so , you know , we now can learn the history of organisms .
not only does it do that ; if you took the genome — that synthetic genome — and you plugged it into a different critter , like yeast , you now turn that yeast into mycoplasma .
it 's , sort of , like booting up a pc with a mac o.s . software .
they now are understanding , and the work is going on , exactly how this plant works , and we have the capability to know , to read that entire code and understand how it ticks .
we could conceivably expand the climate window : we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island , god forbid .
but there 's an ecosystem here .
in other words , we 're not , sort of , unique little organisms running around ; we are part of a big ecosystem .
we find microbial life in every part of the planet : in ice , in coal , in rocks , in volcanic vents ; it 's an amazing thing .
and , again , this is , sort of , my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology : you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in .
we can start to figure that out .
we can figure out what the heck terroir is .
there are thousands of microbes there .
i told you i 'm going to make some of you puke .
we can work within the rules ; we ca n't break the rules ; we 're just learning what the rules are .
i just ask the question , if you could cure all disease — if you could make disease go away , because we understand how it actually works , if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious , healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments , if we could create clean and plentiful energy — we , right in the labs at synthetic genomics , have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline .
and all i can tell you is , stay healthy for 20 years .
`` and if i were to write a volume , it would be called , `` artists who have led my exhibitions '' because my work , in understanding art and in understanding culture , has come by following artists , by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are . ''
my overall project is about art — specifically , about black artists — very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .
my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .
this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races , but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view .
she then assigned these works racial identities , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob colescott , african-american artist ; leon golub , a white artist .
the point of that for me was to say — in that space , in that moment — that i really , more than anything , wanted to understand how images could work , how images did work , and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images .
fast-forward and i end up in harlem ; home for many of black america , very much the psychic heart of the black experience , really the place where the harlem renaissance existed .
can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves ?
this is harlem , actually , on january 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
the studio museum was founded in the late 60s .
in 1975 , muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university .
`` and mohammed ali said , `` '' me , we . '' '' a profound statement about the individual and the community . ''
really , most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring .
but , really , it has been what i 've discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition , to talk about beauty , to talk about power , to talk about ourselves , and to talk and speak to each other .
thank you . ( applause )
`` `` '' what are you going to teach me about right and wrong ? ''
`` i 'm a convict ; i am branded 'wrong . ' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? '' '' so i say to tony , `` '' sorry , but it 's worse than you think . ''
no , do n't just give me an example .
how do we know that it 's wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
maybe it 's you , maybe it 's me — but we 're not here to trade opinions ; everyone 's got an opinion .
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
`` so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , `` '' i do n't know . ''
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
but the robotics part is the hardest part . that 's old brain . that 's really hard .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
`` now , some of you might be thinking , `` '' hold on a minute . she does n't look very much like an ocean rower . ''
well , i do n't know what you 're thinking , but i 'm talking about the beards . ( laughter ) and no matter how long i 've spent on the ocean , i have n't yet managed to muster a decent beard , and i hope that it remains that way .
and i think i knew from day one that it was n't the right job for me .
so , fast forward a few years .
`` and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , `` '' oh boy , i 'm on totally the wrong track here . ''
`` if i carry on living as i am now , i 'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years , or 10 years , or at the end of my life . '' '' i made a few changes , let go of some loose trappings of my old life , and through a bit of a leap of logic , decided to row across the atlantic ocean . ''
and my timing was not great either : 2005 , when i did the atlantic , was the year of hurricane katrina .
there were more tropical storms in the north atlantic than ever before , since records began .
and i really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it .
i eat fruits and nut bars , a lot of nuts .
that 's a bad day at the office .
what do i wear ?
well , i leave that one up to you to judge .
i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps .
i do n't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we 've cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
a bit like being in a washing machine .
i tried to tell them to go away .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
fortunately , help was at hand .
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .
they 'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone , and they were starting to sink .
so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up .
if the atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
we might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean , that it ca n't really make a difference .
the other point : it 's about taking responsibility .
but when i wrote that obituary exercise , i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future .
i was 21 .
we need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes .
np : where it came from .
( laughter ) np : now you can put y'all hands down . ( laughter )
( beatboxing ) ( applause ) ( beatboxing ) ( beatboxing ends ) ( applause ) np : i 'm getting ready to go !
get on up ! come on , stretch !
( cheers and applause ) thank you ! make some noise !
he never lost consciousness .
rather , he watched from within as his body shut down , limb by limb , muscle by muscle .
i moved them like i know i would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day .
at first , i thought it was my own hallucination , having spent so much time tending to this one body , so desperate to see anything react on its own .
as a documentary photographer , i felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn .
finally , i want to share with you a video from a series that i 've been working on that tries to express the slow , in-between existence that my father has experienced .
life triumphs up and down .
instead , he invites me into his space of co-healing to give the very best of myself , and for him to give the very best of himself to me .
today , my father is no longer locked in .
and unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
when i was 11 , seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks made me angry .
why ca n't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world ?
gandhi fought and lead india 's freedom movement .
all these untouchables , three women and two men , they agreed to come .
they brought new utensils .
it was 10 o'clock .
i can not explain my joy when i free a child .
i was so happy .
i created a book bank at the age of 11 .
we organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in a new international convention to protect the children who are in the worst forms .
idea , and — audience : action kailash satyarthi : anger , idea , action . which i tried to do .
( applause ) chris anderson : for many years , you 've been an inspiration to others .
the other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago , as i looked at what even wired was talking about , we thought it was going to be tv , but better .
that was the model . that was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming .
and there 's 55 trillion links between all the web pages of the world .
so it 's a very big number .
it 's just a huge machine , and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .
brewster was saying the library of congress is about twenty terabytes .
because in fact , that 's how your brain works — in kind of the same way that the web works .
however , your brain is n't doubling every two years .
first , that basically what this machine is doing is embodying .
and so in some ways , all you really need is a cloudbook .
it 's wireless . it 's always connected .
but everything , all the cameras , and the microphones , and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
right now , it 's not . if you do spreadsheets and things at work , a word document , they are n't on the web , but they are going to be . they 're going to be part of this machine .
they 're going to speak the web language .
but in fact , what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two , where we embed the information , and the digital nature of things into the material world .
those are the effects that we 're going to see .
so we have a trillion eyes , and ears , and touches , through all our digital photographs and cameras .
and we saw that , where you have all the computers of the world .
we 're now entering to the third stage , which is what i 'm talking about , and that is where we link the data .
i 'm calling it the one machine . but we 're linking data .
so something will resolve down to the information about a particular person , so every person will have a unique id .
if you want to have total personalization , you have to be totally transparent .
we 're so dependent on this that i have now gotten to the point where i do n't even try to remember things — i 'll just google it . it 's easier to do that .
we can not imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing .
but when six billion humans are googling , who 's searching who ? it goes both ways .
we are going to be the machine .
secondly , it 's become much more personalized .
`` so we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system , more as if this was n't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with . it 's a `` '' one . '' '' and i do n't know what else to call it , than the one . ''
( applause )
this is a polio vaccine .
hundreds of people died — children as well as adults .
and in one case , it originated on another continent .
now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you , these are under control now , and it looks like they 'll probably stop very , very quickly .
polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
we 're not trying to control polio .
we want a world in which every child , just like you guys , can take for granted a polio-free world .
and this is because disease eradication , it 's still the venture capital of public health .
and if we can finish polio eradication , the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone .
and polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there 's a few reasons for that .
but the third challenge we have — and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge — is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy — every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash .
and these vaccinators , these volunteers , they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest , densest urban slums in the world .
one reporter who was watching our program in somalia about five years ago — a place which has eradicated polio , not once , but twice , because they got reinfected .
and in each of those , it was only part of the country .
last year , it was 1,000 .
polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
it leaves their children paralyzed , and it drags their families deeper into poverty , because they 're desperately searching and they 're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have , trying in vain to find a cure for their children .
in northern india , we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this , so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters , so we could get to the millions of children on the koshi river basin where there are no other health services .
and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world .
it 's ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years .
we have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics .
it keeps getting reinfected .
bg : now what about the money ?
that 's what it costs to reach 500 million children .
he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter , devil-may-care saunter , flick the cigarette away , grab the girl waiting here , give her a kiss .
so as a youngster , i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes , constantly drawing airplanes .
the product was that airplane .
but it built a romance .
i wanted to build airplanes .
and i found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough .
if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying .
and in so doing , i could produce a model that would fly , stay in the air .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call does n't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry .
so the discipline was — as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air , for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body , and what the body needs , wants , indicates it needs .
i started with a lot of loose ideas , roughly eight or nine years ago .
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they did n't have to fuss with it .
now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
and why should you get a 20-page manual about how to run a chair ?
anyway , i felt that it was important that you did n't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted .
i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place .
if you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that 's what they would tell you .
it 's hard for me to talk about , and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about , so much so that no one 's talking about it .
so you would say i was n't depressed , you would say i was n't suicidal , but you would be wrong .
some people might fear sharks . some people might fear death .
it 's the feelings you ca n't seem to escape , the scariest part is that after a while , you become numb to it . it becomes normal for you , and what you really fear the most is n't the suffering inside of you .
we are so , so , so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains . and that 's ignorance .
that 's pure ignorance , and that ignorance has created a world that does n't understand depression , that does n't understand mental health .
and that 's ironic to me , because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world , yet it 's one of the least discussed .
but right now , depression is society 's deep cut that we 're content to put a band-aid over and pretend it 's not there .
because the world i believe in is one where embracing your light does n't mean ignoring your dark .
the world i believe in is one where we 're measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
we 're people , and we have problems .
`` `` '' stop ! '' '' she screamed . ''
and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories .
pandora 's tim westergren knows this better than most .
when you believe that there is a way around or through whatever is in front of you , that surrender is not an option , you can overcome enormous obstacles .
now , on tv , those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions , particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today .
`` over the last 20 years , four different actors have played the same key role of carly benson on `` '' general hospital . '' '' each new face triggered a change in the character 's life and personality . ''
we can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot , or we can open ourselves to opportunities like carly , who went from nursing student to hotel owner , or like julia child .
and here 's what that means for us .
( laughter ) but i knew my story was n't over , that it could n't be over .
we will all experience what looks like an ending , and we can choose to make it a beginning .
thank you .
and we 'll do it like this , we 'll sell you back your wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary .
why are we building these headquarters ?
we said things like , why ca n't people set their own salaries ?
`` i asked my mother , you know , should i say anything in support of anyone ? and she said , `` '' oh no ! just dis everybody , except ralph nader . '' '' ''
i would make things for people as a way of , you know , giving , showing them my love .
now , this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting .
( laughter ) that 's pretty ambiguous . ( laughter )
since i 'm always liking to solve problems , i gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction , and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth .
and it really — it 's almost like doing visual puns all the time .
when i see objects , i imagine them in motion .
( laughter ) so , this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil . ( laughter )
so , it 's sort of related , but you can see it 's much more overtly erotic .
when i moved to boston , i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society .
so i would never win the race because i 'm always stopping .
and to me , that 's the most important thing because , ever since being a kid , i 've wanted to communicate my passion and love .
so i 'll just let this chair come down .
today , i 'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes .
`` `` '' i know , '' '' i said . `` `` i 'm aware of this custom . ''
`` the american way , to quote burger king , is to `` '' have it your way , '' '' because , as starbucks says , `` happiness is in your choices . '' ''
such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed .
if they had a concept of being true to one 's self , then that self , most likely , [ was ] composed , not of an individual , but of a collective .
success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one 's own preferences .
or , you could say that the individual 's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .
compare this to the die-hard devotion of many americans , not just to a particular flavor of soda , but to a particular brand .
what do they do ?
`` another parent complained , `` '' i feel as if they purposefully tortured me . ''
thank you .
sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book .
`` `` well , it 's a very elegant shade of pink . '' ''
`` and i brought women into the laboratory , and i asked them , `` '' which one would you pick ? '' '' 50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles . ''
people are now talking about whether my country is becoming a little england , or , as one of my colleagues put it , whether we 're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the atlantic ocean .
brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
it was a real shock to me , and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves as inclusive , open and tolerant , perhaps do n't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe .
we see it with the rise in popularity of donald trump in the united states , with the growing nationalism of viktor orbán in hungary , with the increase in popularity of marine le pen in france .
for all of us who care about creating liberal , open , tolerant societies , we urgently need a new vision , a vision of a more tolerant , inclusive globalization , one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind .
that vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization .
it 's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
and that ca n't just be something that 's left to our schools , although that 's important to begin at an early age .
the third thing that i think is crucial , though , and this is really fundamental , is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globalization .
i was a surgical resident at the johns hopkins hospital , taking emergency call .
in her case , i knew there was nothing i could do that was actually going to save her life .
but more importantly , see , i passed no judgment on her , because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself .
you see , in the hubris of my youth , i thought i had her all figured out .
you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
you treat the obesity .
what if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell ?
now , imagine we thought bruises were the problem , and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises : masking creams , painkillers , you name it , all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables .
i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but i 'm wide open to others .
for the past year , i 've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country , and the best part is , just like abraham lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals , we 've done the same thing .
others think it 's too much dietary fat .
just because you know what to do does n't mean you 're always going to do it .
if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .
so in this way , a closed-loop carbon cycle is created .
so a colleague of mine , dr. john reed , and i , were interested , actually , in carbon recycling here on earth .
and we thought it was a really good idea .
we started a company to do it .
one of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
in indonesia , an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately ireland , between 2000 and 2012 .
and as i mentioned before , palm oil is used to manufacture many products .
in fact , it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products are manufactured using palm oil .
and that includes things like ice cream , cookies ...
it also includes detergents , lotions , soaps .
so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture .
and this is what i mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion .
we can imagine a future of abundance .
thank you very much .
for example , we sold people pain medications .
but what happened in more important questions ?
so we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality ?
and then , what level of inequality do we want to have ?
okay , here 's what lots of americans tell us .
you can see how this relates to what you thought .
they wanted to give them about 10 percent of the wealth .
we asked rich and poor , they gave us the same answer , men and women , npr listeners and forbes readers .
the red and the yellow are not that different .
and for older people ?
how do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health , education , jealousy , crime rate , and so on ?
in 1931 , my grandmother — bottom left for you guys over here — graduated from the eighth grade .
when i was a kid , we had a set of encyclopedias at my house .
it was purchased the year i was born , and it was extraordinary , because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
i posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community .
it meant something to them .
luckily , i did n't have to teach them american government .
could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
we could walk there . we did n't even have to pay for the buses .
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it .
the last question of the assignment is : how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people ?
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
let 's see what we can do .
we know how to do this better , and it 's time to do better .
( applause )
like most plutocrats , i too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist .
my friends and i , we own a bank .
in 1980 , the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] , while the bottom 50 percent of americans shared 18 percent .
because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society , the pitchforks will come for us , for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality .
it has never happened . there are no examples .
it 's not a matter of if , it 's when .
middle-out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient , linear , mechanistic , that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness , and instead embraces the 21st-century idea that economies are complex , adaptive , ecosystemic , that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality , that they 're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed .
this 21st-century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources .
the genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system .
it rewards people for solving other people 's problems .
the difference between a poor society and a rich society , obviously , is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens .
but that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers — diverse , able problem solvers — we have , and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate , both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions , and as customers who consume them .
maybe we can do some things .
because , you see , washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation .
seattle should be sliding into the ocean .
washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation .
for thousands of years , these stories were called divine right .
how obviously , transparently self-serving all of this is .
and we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit .
i 'll bet you did n't even know you 're using african technology .
and why did eric merrifield have to invent the dolos ?
the global shipping economy would not be possible without african technology like this .
by the way , you can update facebook and send gmail from a phone like this .
it 's built on gold .
if you think about the railroad system in north america and how that worked , first came the infrastructure , then came the industry around it , the brothels — it 's a bit like the internet today , right ? — and everything else that worked with it : bars , saloons , etc .
so what are some of the things that you can do with it ?
and if you can do that , you can rise out of poverty .
he comes from pretoria , the capital of [ south africa ] , about 50 kilometers from where i live .
so , people like to call africa a mobile-first continent , but actually it 's mobile-only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we 're solving the world 's problems .
there are attempts to create milieus , change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer , for instance .
what 's really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor .
about 10 years ago — i 've been a runner most of my life — i went for a run , a saturday morning run , i came back and woke up and i basically could n't move .
50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs .
the nice thing about australians is that they 're habitually used to looking at the world upside down .
and two , that maybe that , the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what 's causing osteochondral arthritis , a very common ailment .
and they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage .
you can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton , you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory , and they are dying to form cartilage .
these cells are dying to form cartilage .
now , the fourth one is the most ominous , and that is that their numbers decline precipitously , precipitously , tenfold , fiftyfold , as you age .
we had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories .
you know , we know that exercise remodels bone , but come on , none of us is going to exercise .
what we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells ?
we heard about the problems of unleashing growth .
could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing ?
how could we implant those memories back in ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
it 's certainly true that it would be lovely to have new medicines .
but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible m 's : mechanisms , models , metaphors .
so check it , i 'm gon na to catch mockingbirds .
i 'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .
i 'll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
there 's about 10 million phage per job .
and i 'm also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
`` but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes , one after the other , and finally found myself in television . ( laughter ) i said that to bill moyers , and he said , `` '' oh , we take anybody . '' '' ( laughter ) and i was doing some rather controversial religious programs . ''
but i got sent to jerusalem to make a film about early christianity .
and to my astonishment , when i began seriously studying other traditions , i began to realize that belief — which we make such a fuss about today — is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , in about the 17th century .
in the 17th century , it narrowed its focus , for reasons that i 'm exploring in a book i 'm writing at the moment , to include — to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions , a credo .
and in particular , every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted — has said — and put at the core of their tradition what 's become known as the golden rule .
that , he said , was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day .
`` hillel stood on one leg and said , `` '' that which is hateful to you , do not do to your neighbor . that is the torah . the rest is commentary . ''
saint augustine made exactly the same point .
the causes of our present woes are political .
but , make no mistake about it , religion is a kind of fault line , and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region , religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem . our modernity has been exceedingly violent .
people seem to think , now equate religious faith with believing things .
as though that — we call religious people often believers , as though that were the main thing that they do . and very often , secondary goals get pushed into the first place , in place of compassion and the golden rule .
the greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people .
we need to create a movement among all these people that i meet in my travels — you probably meet , too — who want to join up , in some way , and reclaim their faith , which they feel , as i say , has been hijacked .
we need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos , and to give guidelines . this charter would not be a massive document .
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
and if you do all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
but if you do one step every time , maybe you do n't care as much .

i 'm a civil rights lawyer , and i 've seen some horrible things in the world .
and then in 1994 , i was sent to rwanda to be the director of the u.n. 's genocide investigation .
but i just wish that i , and the rest of the world , had been moved earlier .
she had to watch her youngest son , peter , suffer from malnutrition , as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness .
thirty-five years ago , when i would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
moreover , the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty , which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day , that has fallen from 50 percent , to only 15 percent .
this is massive progress , and this exceeds everybody 's expectations about what is possible .
well , let 's think about venus for a moment .
but until i had actually talked to venus , i would have had no idea that none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die .
in fact , half a century of anti-poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history .
in fact , now when you survey very , very poor communities , residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence .
functioning law enforcement for us is just a total assumption .
but what if there was no law enforcement to protect you ?
so terrified , she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do : she calls 911 — but only to learn that because of budget cuts in her county , law enforcement was n't available on the weekends .
they do n't talk about it .
but the more fundamental reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected , is because the people inside the developing world , with money , do n't need it .
almost all criminal justice systems , they start out broken and corrupt , but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment .
where were you ?
and we 've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by more than 1,000 percent .
ca : but to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
in the past , there 's been a little bit of training of the courts , but they get crappy evidence from the police , or a little police intervention that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement , so it 's about pulling that all together , and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us , which is imperfect in our own experience , for sure , but boy , is it a great thing to sense that you can call 911 and maybe someone will protect you .

metaphor lives a secret life all around us .
in this , elvis is following aristotle 's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else .
now , here , shakespeare gives the thing , juliet , a name that belongs to something else , the sun .
what we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called bouba , and which is called kiki .
neckties are loud .
the participants had to identify , as quickly as possible , the literally false sentences .
sadly , it 's metaphorically true .
`` agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing , as in , `` '' the nasdaq climbed higher . '' '' object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things , as in , `` '' the dow fell like a brick . '' '' researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries , and then predict the next day 's price trend . ''
a group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the u.s. for help .
intervene , appeal to the u.n. , or do nothing ?
each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy : world war ii , vietnam , and the third was historically neutral .
but you just have to look at the words around you and you 'll find it .
`` the latin word `` '' cogito '' '' is derived from the prefix `` '' co , '' '' meaning `` '' together , '' '' and the verb `` '' agitare , '' '' meaning `` '' to shake . '' '' so , the original meaning of `` '' cogito '' '' is to shake together . ''
cities , past and future .
so , act i : a map found .
and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love landscapes .
here 's bowling green . and here 's broadway .
or murray hill . and this is the murrays ' house on murray hill , 200 years ago .
if we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time .
so , act ii : a home reconstructed .
and feed into that the map of the species .
and i think this is what we 're learning about building cities in the future .
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs , and streams winding through the city , and windmills supplying the power we need ?
we 've questioned the future of capitalism .
we 've looked at our government oversight .
we 've questioned where we 're going .
so , to understand this — and i 'm going to stress this — it 's not about the consumer being in retreat .
in order to understand this , we 're going to step back and look a little bit at what 's happened over the course of the last year and a half .
will the bailout work ? we have national debt , detroit , currency valuations , healthcare , all these issues facing us .
in fact , let 's go back and look at what caused this crisis , because the consumer , all of us , in our daily lives , actually contributed a large part to the problem .
so , what happened though , over the course of the last 20 years — we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
but that 's not really the whole story .
based on y & r 's brandasset valuator , proprietary tool of vml and young & rubicam , we set out to understand what 's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace .
what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting .
they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month , less at the end of the month . so what they did is they started to change their packaging .
we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city , you know , in january , and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter .
( laughter ) so , from a value and values standpoint , what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .
we 're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon , not a sprint .
perfect example of that is patagonia .
patagonia 's footprint chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make , and gives you social responsibility , and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make .
this is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace .
everything about locally derived products and services , supporting your local neighborhoods , whether it 's cheeses , wines and other products .
so , this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon .
they actually started , in certain communities in the united states , start to publish people 's electricity usage .
you have to realize that you ca n't fight and control this .
you actually need to organize it .
it 's a moving truck through l.a. , and the only way you can find it is through twitter .
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt , all because the consumer is demanding it .
and on my dive , i went down 18,000 feet , to an area that i thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor .
so i began to work with national geographic society and others and led expeditions to antarctica .
it 's out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
`` they 've never been dived . '' '' and i said , `` '' yeah . ''
that 's the vessel that we took up there for these studies , early on , and that 's what the islands look like — you can see in the background .
`` let 's try there , '' '' and then falling into the water . ''
the phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries , especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .
and we finished our trip .
you can see the islands — there are eight islands — that pop out of the water .
and they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands .
`` so i asked the minister over dinner , i said , `` '' would you consider a situation where you would still get paid — we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is — but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water ? '' '' he stopped , and he said , `` '' yes , we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem , and i think we would call it a reverse fishing license . '' '' he coined the term `` '' reverse fishing license . '' '' so i said , `` '' yes , a 'reverse fishing license . ' '' '' so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point . ''
here 's this resource that we 're looking to save , and it turns out it 's the hottest heating event that we can find on record .
and it certainly was .
and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .
kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment .
so the conditions for success here are listed .
his name was joe mckenna .
family history says he loved being a fireman , and so in 1938 , on one of his days off , he elected to hang out at the firehouse .
to make himself useful that day , he started polishing all the brass , the railings on the fire truck , the fittings on the walls , and one of the fire hose nozzles , a giant , heavy piece of metal , toppled off a shelf and hit him .
his condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood .
my great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era .
next , we 'd probably lose surgery .
we 'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor .
there has never yet been a drug they could not defeat .
we could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use .
we do n't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer , because we decided those things were expensive , destructive , not in our best interest .
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations .
they say , you know , such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people , because we test students with problems they have n't seen before .
you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in shanghai and 15-year-olds in chile , and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance .
there 's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today 's economy .
but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture .
and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people .
you also see — and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings — that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries , and poor and badly-educated ones , a very , very important lesson .
last but not least , koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop .
students do n't have long hours of learning .
let 's go back to the year 2000 .
we spent a lot less on education , about 35 percent less on education .
and what 's really interesting is that this was n't just about optimizing existing policies , but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education .
or take korea , at the other end of the spectrum .
in the year 2000 , korea did already very well , but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence .
and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of homogeneity of societies , and so on , these people must now concede that education improvement is possible .
in the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
the past was about delivered wisdom in education .
high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control — sort of , how do you check whether people do what they 're supposed to do in education — to professional forms of work organization .
high-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive .
in the past , the policy focus was on outcomes , on provision .
and how do they do that ?
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
( applause )
then , about the initiative that chris mentioned , that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 .
and perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech , but if you can imagine the time when this occurred — it was in the mid '40s — this was really , in his view , a pretty piece of high tech .
a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet .
and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome .
and so , we believe that through all the changes that have occurred , that we 're faced today with a tremendous opportunity .
if we can connect people and ideas more intensely — and although you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today , the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity , in a useful way , accessibility , in an easy manner , and also affordability , that regardless of the economic status that a person could have , that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good — has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
so , when you look at this chart , you look at the very last — it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale — you look at the very end : we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent .
when you look at elementary-school children , we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet .
and frankly — and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this , but i truly mean it — if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it , it would be very difficult to judge who made it , because they 're all highly commoditized but they 're all different .
in other parts , it does n't .
they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity .
let me come back to the beginning , to end this presentation .
and one of the things that i learned , too , from my parents — and i 'll give you a little anecdote — especially from my father .
`` because i knew what a great husband he was , and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me , like he did when i was a little kid . and then a few years later , i had a child , my first child , and again , my father comes to the hospital , and we 're looking at the glass , and see all the children on the other side , and he said , `` '' i 've got to remind you again , that for each generation to do better , you 're going to have to be a better father than i was . '' '' that 's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge ''
but the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better , to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the ceo of a fortune 500 company .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and some of them are going to be great , and some of them are going to be irritating , but they 're all related to me .
we have just 17 links between us .
and my cousin , of course , the actor kevin bacon — ( laughter ) — who is my first cousin 's twice removed 's wife 's niece 's husband 's first cousin once removed 's niece 's husband .
what 's the importance ?
we all have a bit of their dna in us .
it 's going to be at the new york hall of science ,
he was a former member of the obama administration .
goodbye .
now ...
and somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple .
we 're afraid of suffering , we 're afraid of pain , we 're afraid of mortality .
so to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart .
and we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye .
we are losing the time we have for ourselves .
you 're going back to simplicity .
you do things in life — it 's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way .
you have to make the change on yourself .
( chatter ) i 'm asking two minutes of your time , that 's so little .
in fact , co-wives can fight with each other , sometimes they can even poison each other 's children .
unchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin , women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality .
i then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in 40 countries .
it 's associated with the concept of paradox of choice .
`` in fact , i 've been studying this recently , and i actually think there 's some sort of sweet spot in the brain ; i do n't know what it is , but apparently , from reading a lot of the data , we can embrace about five to nine alternatives , and after that , you get into what academics call `` '' cognitive overload , '' '' and you do n't choose any . ''
there 's got to be some darwinian explanation — not that many people are crazy .
so i came to realize that i do n't think this is recklessness ; i think it 's caution .
`` and 81 percent said , `` '' yes . '' '' in fact , the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology . ''
for millions of years , our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
they brought the produce to local markets , and came home with the equivalent of money .
`` he said , `` '' the dark , uneasy world of family life — where the greatest can fail , and the humblest succeed . '' '' but i will leave you with this : love and attachment will prevail , technology can not change it . ''
let 's have her join us on the stage .
and at the same time , as you talk about this cognitive overload , i see many , many people who ...
you study the brain and i study people 's relationships and stories , so i think it 's everything you say , plus .
ep : yes , but you — hf : i do want to say one more thing .
they were n't square !
and i 'm not suggesting that we do , but the bottom line is , we 've always had alternatives .
`` mankind is always — in fact , the brain is well-built to what we call `` '' equilibrate , '' '' to try and decide : do i come , do i stay ? do i go , do i stay ? ''
ks : well , thank you both so much .
now , like most of us , i 'd been online , i 'd see my house , so i thought , i 'll hop in there and i 'll start looking up some of these facilities .
but i was intrigued .
now , in theory , all of these questions could be answered by imagery , but not if it 's old .
i think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally , but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected , some friends and i put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010 .
does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets ?
was n't there a way to build a smaller , simpler , new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging ?
i realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites , but fortunately we had help .
and these were built with electronics obtained from radioshack instead of lockheed martin .
now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and i began a series of sketches of our own satellite design .
and we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this .
now people use these because they get a lot of light , which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image .
we see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier , and beyond economic data , unlocking the human story , moment by moment .
but one day , a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand .
you may wonder , do i ever photograph people ?
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
( applause )
francesca fedeli : ciao .
he was born two and a half years ago , and i had a pretty tough pregnancy because i had to stay still in a bed for , like , eight months .
so he got the right weight at birth .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
roberto d'angelo : as you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
i mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
and you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
basically , we spent months doing this with mario .
and when i look out in the future , i ca n't imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we do n't have robots everywhere .
and we 've seen , over the last two or three years , lawn-mowing robots , husqvarna on the bottom , friendly robotics on top there , an israeli company .
we 're going to give this away i think , chris said , after the talk .
( laughter ) on board that robot is a pc running linux .
and over the next couple of months , we 're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground .
but robots like this , they 're a little hard to program .
we saw when we 're interacting , we 're trying to show someone how to do something , we direct their visual attention .
and we 've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you 're going to want to interact with robots in the future .
and it looks right at that .
at the same time , some top-down sort of stuff : might decide that it 's lonely and look for skin tone , or might decide that it 's bored and look for a toy to play with .
we got a bunch of naive subjects in , we did n't tell them anything about the robot , sat them down in front of the robot and said , talk to the robot .
it was just saying random english phonemes .
this is another robot , cog .
they first make eye contact , and then , when christie looks over at this toy , the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at .
we do n't like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures — i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
and that effort has helped .
here it is : people who are poor .
up in the left-hand corner is jobana , sintia and bertha .
they started a cleaning business .
it was not a full-time gig , no one could watch the little ones all day .
but it made a difference for their families .
she went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter , with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle .
it 's a performance venue .
it 's a home for poets , musicians and artists .
i 've built a career .
baakir has experience and a track record .
so , consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy .
we are magic .
the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically , we have n't actually gotten any happier .
well , as with many other domains in life , i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question .
which leaves the question , what are the big causes of happiness ?
since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they 're going to someplace happier than the place that they 're leaving . it would make a lot of sense .
in other words , maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering .
as it turns out , people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they 're not .
maybe that 's what 's really going on . how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites ?
as it turns out , there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later , consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy .
how does that depend on what people are doing ?
what do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11.5 million documents , verify it and make sense of it ?
john doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm , every client file , every email , from 1977 to the present day .
but it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism .
the issues we report on are more and more transnational .
environmental and health crises are global .
the reason journalists are scared of technology is this : the profession 's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news .
who best in canada than a canadian ?
for nine months , he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife .
in all that time , he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country .
this is the scene in iceland the day after we published .
the icelandic prime minister had to resign .
gr : thank you .
this species lives only in the congo .
and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside .
maybe it 's his ability to have causal thought .
so when you compare them to the bonobo , the bonobo is a little hairier .
and i do n't really think it 's in our biology ; i think we 've attributed it to our biology , but i do n't really think it 's there .
right now , he 's in a forest in georgia .
as you can see , there 's not a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked .
and now we see all four .
video : narrator : the wild bonobo lives in central africa , in the jungle encircled by the congo river .
canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee .
none of them are tricks .
video : you going to help get some sticks ?
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
he 's learning about how to keep a fire going .
these are happy vocalizations .
video : you 're happy .
you 're very happy about this part .
( laughter ) like us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
here panbanisha uses scissors , instead of her hands , to groom nyota .
nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself .
ss : kanzi 's learned to make stone tools .
she keeps staring out the window .
ss : i normally talk about language .
ss ( video ) : very nice . beautiful , panbanisha .
ss : at first we did n't really realize what she was doing , until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it .
once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
dr. sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
she was n't forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
( laughter ) researcher : ok , now get the monsters . get them .
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
narrator : none of us , bonobo or human , can possibly even imagine ?
and they 're learning to become like us .
thank you .
now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree , but that 's not my interest , and nor is swap trading , per se .
are more hip than hippie .
and linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world — from the election of a president to the infamous wikipedia , and everything in between — on what the power of numbers could achieve .
now , you know when you learn a new word , and then you start to see that word everywhere ?
i mean , we 're monkeys , and we 're born and bred to share and cooperate .
yet , it 's hard for us to individually know what to do .
so all of this is a lot of twittering , right ?
and although they vary enormously in scale , maturity and purpose , when we dived into them , we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems .
they 're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'r ' — reduce , reuse , recycle , repair and redistribute — because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste .
this is where you pay for the benefit of the product — what it does for you — without needing to own the product outright .
so when you consider these two facts , it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright .
now all of these systems require a degree of trust , and the cornerstone to this working is reputation .
thank you very much .
( applause )
it 's a real pleasure to be here .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
it was like manna from heaven .
and the u.s. military spends 1.5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 1940 dollars — developing the norden bombsight .
and there were people , strategists , within the u.s. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the nazis and against the japanese .
and for norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because norden was a committed christian .
so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
we live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they 've invented gadgets that will forever change our world .
but we need to be very clear about how little that means .
that 's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
or take the battle in afghanistan .
now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
i have not described to you a success story .
and this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make .
the air force 's 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which did n't need a bombsight at all .
( applause )
this tool that i 'm using here is a little experiment .
it 's called pivot , and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths — say , accidents .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
it 's in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
so you see , we 're navigating the web for the first time as if it 's actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and then everything went black .
my head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath .
i was at a crossroads .
you 'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
`` but before i left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , `` '' janine , i want you to be ready , because when you get home , something 's going to happen . '' '' and i said , `` '' what ? '' '' and she said , `` you 're going to get depressed . '' ''
`` she said , `` '' you are , because , see , it happens to everyone . ''
you 're in a wheelchair . that 's normal .
i 'd lost so much weight in the hospital i now weighed about 80 pounds .
i wanted my old life back . i wanted my body back .
it was life itself . i realized that this was n't just my pain .
i had never before thought of myself as a creative person .
but now i was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do : that of rebuilding a life .
it was beautiful . they lifted me into the cockpit .
they had to slide me up on the wing , put me in the cockpit .
`` he said , `` '' would you like to have a go at taxiing ? '' '' that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground . ''
`` and i said , `` '' yeah . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , you take the controls , and you fly towards that mountain . '' '' and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun . ''
so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again , i went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amazingly , i passed my pilot 's medical , and that was my green light to fly .
`` the philosopher lao tzu once said , `` '' when you let go of what you are , you become what you might be . '' '' i now know that it was n't until i let go of who i thought i was that i was able to create a completely new life . ''
i know that i 'm not my body , and i also know that you 're not yours .
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean , and it 's where life — the title of our seminar tonight — it 's where life began .
about 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories .
they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they 're sick or lazy , but that 's a typical behavior , they lie out and bask on the surface .
and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place , was this terribly bizarre shape .
you know , if you give mother nature enough time , that is what she will produce .
they look — maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished , abridged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the — they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .
they school as adolescents , and become behemoth loners as adults .
that 's a little diver up there in the corner .
now i do n't know how you 'd feed a child like that but — we do n't know how fast the molas grow in the wild , but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium — one of the first places to have them in captivity — they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months .
i said , now , that 's a true american .
and we 're interested in how these animals are using the currents , using temperature , using the open ocean , to live their lives .
and they 're not thrown back as by-catch , they 're eaten .
they 're not big migrators . this is their track : we deployed the tag off of tokyo , and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there .
so that 's a very important piece of data .
it 's never — it 's really never been a more exciting , or a vital time , to be a biologist .
if it 's helping to unite the world , i think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
i never got the rocket , i only got the motorcycle .
but it did n't work out . ( laughter ) i went to art school .
and film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own .
unfortunately , evel knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him , and he sued us for this video — ( laughter ) — shortly thereafter .
but then i started thinking , okay , well that 's a part of you , but how do i put all of you inside of the frame ?
`` and this is one called `` '' the treachery of sanctuary . '' '' it 's a triptych . i 'm going to show you the third panel . ''
so what i 'm going to show you is not a view into the world , it 's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle .
i have lived here in the zaatari camp in jordan for the last year and a half .
i asked my father if i cried when i was a baby and he says i did not .
you 're looking around through this world .
so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos in january .
thank you .
they are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science .
and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene , which is here . it 's a small organic molecule . you 've probably never heard of it .
and because it 's so much stuff , it 's really important for the atmospheric system .
but still , we look at the pieces .
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening .
we have to get special flight clearance .
so , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft does n't look like any plane you would take on vacation .
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .
now , stories like naghma 's unfortunately are all too common , and from the comforts of our home , we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women 's rights .
in 2008 , i went to afghanistan for a justice funded program , and i went there originally on this nine-month program to train afghan lawyers .
the role of laws is to protect .
and so in order for that to happen , we needed to get the village elders together , we needed to get the tribal leaders together , the religious leaders .
and what was different about the second jirga is this time , we put the law at the center of it , and it was very important for me that they all understood that naghma had a right to be protected .
most — ( applause ) thanks .
he works for the new york times , and unfortunately , a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government .
it 's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press , because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent .
according to unicef , there are currently over 280 million boys and girls who are married under the age of 15 .
she was severely beaten with metal rods .
they burned her body .
they tied her up in a basement and starved her .
as a lawyer , i try to be very strong for all my clients , because that 's very important to me , but seeing her , how broken and very weak as she was , was very difficult .
in addition to this , we also decided to sue for civil damages , again using a law that 's never been used , but we used it for her case .
`` a few months ago , a south african lawyer visited me in my office and he said , `` '' i wanted to meet you . ''
15 years ago i received a phone call from a friend .
in fact , i read it in the newspaper .
at the time of the phone call i just had a baby , i successfully completed a management buyout to the company i was working with , and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons .
because she believed that the only way to unblock what , at the time , was known as a blocked democracy , italy , a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle .
now , contrary to what many people believe , terrorism is actually a very expensive business .
all the others do , day in and day out , is search for money .
so , because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms , all of the sudden i thought , maybe there is something here .
and as we were eating , i had the distinct feeling that i was back in the city of london , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
so , i decided that i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism .
i sold my company , and funded the research myself .
and what i discovered is this parallel reality , another international economic system , which runs parallel to our own , which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii .
a mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
then comes the late 1970s , early '80s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
this is an organization that can raise money across border .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
and it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars .
it is trillions , it 's not billions .
these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers , in cash of course .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
it closed that door between the money laundering in dollars , and the u.s. economy .
people simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the united states into europe .
and it was introduced only for the u.s. dollars .
you got to question everything that is told to you , including what i just told you today .
and , above all , it 's not going to be boring .
`` so it might be that , if you went to a french restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they did n't have butter , you could say , `` '' ah , i see what 's wrong with them . ''
`` i can make them healthy . '' '' and there probably are special cases of that . ''
it 's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
so this great triumph — it 's so good , there 's almost a religious experience in biology .
and darwinian evolution is really the core theory .
and so by reading the genome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know .
i did the 23andme thing and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald .
and the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells — actually , the machines that are operating — that 's where the action is .
it could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent , so it 's not a nice digital thing like dna .
and then one day , i get a call from john doerr , bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call .
`` not going to be easy . '' '' he 's like , `` '' no , no . i really need it . ''
`` and i realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so i said , `` '' well , let 's look at it . '' '' applied minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody 's funding or permission or anything . ''
so we started playing around with this .
and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood .
and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein .
so here we have alice in green and bob in red .
and so that 's the basic thing doctors are trained to do , and it 's miraculous in the case of infectious disease — how well it works .
the problem is that , in cancer , there is n't something else that 's inside of you .
it 's you ; you 're broken .
and of course , it really does n't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system .
and in fact , i think we 're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing .
i think this is the big mistake .
i think cancer should not be a noun .
and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen , that helps .
david got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute and anna barker was there .
of course , we 'll do surgery sometimes and so on .
so the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ?
so a plague outbreak in surat , india becomes not an obscure event , but a globalized event — a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation .
at the end of last christmas only 13 countries had seen h5n1 .
we 're worried because this virus , unlike any other flu we 've ever studied , can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals .
it mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus , the last great pandemic , in that it also jumped directly from birds to people .
and 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage .
nobody knows the chain of command .
and you 'll have massive competition .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states .
well then what about all the workers ? they wo n't go to work if their kids are n't in school .
well the british government did a model of telecommuting .
six weeks they had all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway .
and that 's just office workers , bankers .
but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands .
the institute of medicine tried to look at the masking question .
if you go online right now , you 'll get so much phony-baloney information .
and tamiflu . you 've probably heard of this drug , made by hoffmann-la roche , patented drug .
nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of tamiflu .
russia has actually stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all russians .
when i say enough , that 's two weeks worth .
every city , county , state did their own thing .
and the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
a new study by chris murray at harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the brits in india , there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the indians .
so what does that mean for you ? well the first thing is , i would n't start building up personal stockpiles of anything — for yourself , your family , or your employees — unless you 've really done your homework .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks .
well if you think it 's going to last 18 months , are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks for every single person in your family ?
everybody has come up to me and said , well i 'll stockpile water or , i 'll stockpile food , or what have you .
at a minimum the british banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful .
it probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other , or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands .
laurie garret : what factors determine the duration of a pandemic , we do n't really know .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
lg : the moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission .
then i think that there is universal agreement now , at who all the way down : send out the alert .
and i do n't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of lipitor or something of that nature .
and our centers for disease control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic .
i 'm thinking dipstick .
what percentage of infected people were killed by it ?
`` we 've never seen anything even remotely like this before . '' '' it wo n't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters because those antibodies are n't here . ''
so we 're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
and i think my time is up . i thank you all for your attention .
( laughter ) and he wanted to go .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and a third . ( applause )
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did .
please join us in this epic adventure .
and over there i experienced other people 's suffering , up close and personal , immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times i experienced great fear for my own life .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend 's homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings , where a drink often cost more than what they 'd paid their 14-year-old maid .
paradoxically , when i let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment .
today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin , and they are destitute , like these young men in the image .
how do you live with yourself if you know you 've committed horrific crimes ?
we accompanied joshua , as he walked the earth , visiting villages where he had once killed and raped .
and all this against incredible logistical odds , like heat and traffic jams .
now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
45 percent of the 14 million people who live in delhi live in unauthorized slums , which are chronically overcrowded .
they lack even the most basic amenities .
i was introduced to robyn , the swedish pop star , and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion .
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format .
when she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
it may be taken for granted in canada , in america , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it 's a big event for the life of girl .
i imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well .
musicians were silenced , girls were flogged and singers were killed .
it was a doomsday for my family and for me .
chris anderson : and now we go live to caracas to see one of maestro abreu 's great proteges .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
a few years ago , after finishing my ph.d. in london , i moved to boston .
it sent me over mass . ave. , massachusetts avenue , the shortest route from boston to cambridge .
but after a month that i was cycling every day on the car-packed mass . ave. , i took a different route one day .
now let me ask you : am i alone here ?
i changed my research from traditional data-mining to understanding how people experience the city .
if i were to show you these two urban scenes , and i were to ask you which one is more beautiful , which one would you say ?
after that work , i joined yahoo labs , and i teamed up with luca and rossano , and together , we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city , a cartography weighted for human emotions .
let me introduce you to something i 've been working on .
edi , edi .
audiences marveled at the way they moved .
edi is different .
edi : i have two seven-axis arms — mt : core of sensing — edi : a 360-degree sonar detection system , and come complete with a warranty .
mt : we love robots .
in the first story about robots , they turn against their creators .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
i literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next , you know , but it scares me .
mt : we anthropomorphize our machines .
i became operational at ted in march 2014 .
( music ) thank you .
one of the things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine , that lovely caslon type , and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context .
in the new yorker , it goes out to a wide audience , and when you actually look at that , and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at , and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting .
right ? you thought it was funny .
a hundred and nine voted it a 10 , the highest . ten voted it one .
this person rated it a two .
how are you going to manage it ?
`` `` there is no justice in the world . there is some justice in the world . the world is just . '' ''
this is what lemmings believe .
you know , it 's my view basically about religion , that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend .
there 's an incongruity and a contrast .
well , i 'm going to kill a few , but there wo n't be any genocide .
definitely no . [ several hours after lunch ] ( siren ) no . get out of here .
`` if we think it 's completely wrong , we say , `` '' that 's not funny . '' '' and if it 's completely okay , what 's the joke ? okay ? ''
within that context , we feel it 's okay .
`` you glance over at this , and it says , `` '' asshead . please help '' '' ? god . ''
the first week we did no cartoons .
it 's not always appropriate every time .
these cartoons are not about them . they 're about us .
it 's 95 percent of the humor . it 's not our humor .
`` ( laughter ) `` lassie ! get help ! ! '' ( laughter ) ''
`` here , in the nonsense range : `` damn it , hopkins , did n't you get yesterday 's memo ? '' ''
it 's sort of a smorgasbord that 's made all interesting .
but there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse , such as japan , java , tonga and tikopea . so evidently , societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia . there are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as nepal , indonesia and columbia .
obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . if anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they 're an idiot . this is a complex subject .
but scratch the surface , and montana suffers from serious problems .
fourth : relations with hostiles . montanans have the same problems as do all americans , in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies , and terrorist attacks . and finally , last item on my checklist : question of how political , economic , social , cultural attitudes play into this . montanans have long-held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .
an analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish .
and the other generalization that i want to mention is that it 's particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . for example , the greenland norse , in this difficult environment , were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion , and by their strong social cohesion . but those two things — commitment to religion and strong social cohesion — also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the inuit . or today — australia .
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it 's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
( applause )
anybody who has an internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it .
now , we 've all heard of distance education , but the students way in the back , 200 feet away from the instructor , i think they are undergoing long-distance education .
it 's like going from ox carts to the airplane .
everything really has to change .
and you heard of this example , where , when we launched our very first course — and this was an mit-hard circuits and electronics course — about a year and a half ago , 155,000 students from 162 countries enrolled in this course .
so today , i want to discuss a different aspect , the other side of moocs , take a different perspective .
i call it teen-lish .
it 's got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
`` `` hmm . '' ''
`` silence . ( laughter ) `` can you listen to me ? '' ''
she must have thought , you know , some friend of hers was calling her .
now , i 'm older , and my youthful looks might belie that , but i 'm not in the millennial generation .
just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more , but the early results are incredible .
so a student might watch a five- , seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise .
instead , would n't it be nice with online technologies , we offer videos and interactive engagements to students ?
the third idea that we have is instant feedback .
i mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
you know , they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it .
and this can also be graded by the computer .
let me tell you a story .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
it was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
it 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
and they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different .
this is a newt re-growing its limb .
i 'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
and he asked a very important question .
so i 'm going to put the slide up now . it wo n't be up for long .
the treatment for this is amputation .
that 's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
darpa just gave steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
this is happening today .
this was done by teruo okano at tokyo women 's hospital .
again , if you 're squeamish , you do n't want to watch .
this was a randomized trial .
if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic .
this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world .
everything that is done to treat burn — basically we do a sodding approach .
a number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
the japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
( laughter ) my brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me .
for example , once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages .
and i had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment , but within days of them prescribing a new medication , my life turned into an episode of the walking dead .
my family finally rescued me , but by that time , i had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks , as well as developing severe anemia , and was on the verge of suicide .
but there 's a gap between where that stands , and how i communicate it with the rest of the world .
and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .
so , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , i launched project prakash .
and the logo — even though it looks extremely irish , it 's actually derived from the indian symbol of diya , an earthen lamp .
the prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study .
that 's a case of microphthalmos , which is malformed eyes , and that 's a permanent condition ; it can not be treated .
after treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
`` when you ask them , `` even if you ca n't name the objects , just point to where the objects are , '' these are the regions that they point to . ''
even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object .
patient : triangle .
patient : a square and a circle .
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
this simple idea has far reaching implications .
i 'm at mit , at mit you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain .
( laughter ) i had to have long conversations with my wife . ( laughter )
so , we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby 's visual acuity .
if you think about your life today , you go every day through many different scales , many different changes of rhythm and pace .
but according to a really great science historian you might know , peter galison — he teaches at harvard — what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest , this real passion for design .
the exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists , and show how they 're presenting the possibilities of the future to us .
a lot of the objects in the show are concepts , not objects that exist already . but what you 're looking at here is the work of some scientists from ucla .
this kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins — not only by color but literally by alphabet letters .
in this case too , you have a mixture of scientists and designers .
and so , the assignment to the students was , how should the steak of tomorrow be ?
this is a spa telephone . the idea is that it 's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa , you have a massage , you have a facial , maybe a rub , and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature , and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you 've been wanting to talk with for a long time .
so , various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays .
they 're still very useful .
so he designed all these series of accessories .
the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits .
the dawn of books is , of course , important .
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in 1455 .
you see , the book was not driven by reading .
they traveled all around europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .
`` as james salter wrote , `` life passes into pages if it passes into anything . '' ''
and when i then began to compile my list , i was quickly obsessed , searching pages and pages for ages and ages .
here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years .
`` `` twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations , '' `` sixty-two , ... of subtle diminishments . '' ''
( laughter ) i was mindful , too , that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next , and that people may experience the same age differently .
`` but even so , as the list coalesced , so , too , on the page , clear as the reflection in the mirror , did the life that i had been living : finding at 20 that `` '' ... one is less and less sure of who one is ; '' '' emerging at 30 from the `` '' ... wasteland of preparation into active life ; '' '' learning at 40 `` '' ... to close softly the doors to rooms [ i would ] not be coming back to . '' '' there i was . ''
it had happened to him , as to them .
now the list is done : a hundred years .
today , many people who live in the emerging markets , where 90 percent of the world 's population lives , believe that the western obsession with political rights is beside the point , and what is actually important is delivering on food , shelter , education and healthcare .
i 'm not saying people in the emerging markets do n't understand democracy , nor am i saying that they would n't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders .
and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
she 's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
perhaps it 's no surprise that in a 2007 pew survey , when surveyed , africans in 10 countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
now the fact of the matter is , if the west decides to compete , it will create a wider schism .
the fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
instead of criticizing china for bad behavior , the west should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
this is an affidavit from the zambian government .
( laughter ) now that was the advice that st. benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
but all i learned about work-life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i did n't have any work .
( laughter ) not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations are n't going to solve this issue for us .
on the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
( laughter ) drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
meditate for half an hour .
there 's nothing in my life apart from my work .
`` because people say , `` '' bloody hell mate , i have n't got time to get fit . ''
so when you put the gel on , it actually reassembles into this local tissue .
now , this is a simulated arterial bleed — blood warning — at twice human artery pressure .
so now , this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic , and like i said before , would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop .
the trouble is , it 's all going in the wrong direction .
what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
and they work .
( laughter ) yeah , you did .
i 'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex .
sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of dna shared between two or more beings .
now invariably , you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
and the tapir has a prehensile penis .
( laughter ) mm-hm . ( laughter ) so with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
we have to think about function as well , and when it comes to sex , function relates to the contributions made by the gametes , or the sperm and the eggs .
i mean , if a female does n't choose a particular male , or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough , then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things : avoiding predators , taking care of offspring , gathering and ingesting food .
now if you 've ever been out for a nice , peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex , you 've undoubtedly been alarmed , because it looks like gang rape .
earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones .
why do they do this ?
now unfortunately , in the animal kingdom , it 's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again .
now , even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal : they 're run by females , groups of females , sisters , aunts and offspring , and when young males attain sexual maturity , they 're turfed out of the group .
well , sex is just so much more than insert part a into slot b and hope that the offspring run around everywhere .
i beat up the pasta maker to make that .
these are a — this is like a 15 million dollar line .
and in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who could n't make it to the show .
and i 'm really not very good at it .
and every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and — and we 'd make some money on that , you know . and we 'd give it out .
throughout this whole thing , making toys , i think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science .
there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows , you know , to find innovation .
and actually , this is , to me , how i can come up with great ideas .
as he said , i was co-inventor of the furby .
let 's make these things .
this is a smaller one , and i have a little moving torso on there .
he actually has skeletor legs , i think , he 's wearing there .
the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces .
and this is a — you know , the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear .
and so , i have all these design books , like i 'm sure many of you have .
and there 's the first little cam that drove furby .
`` so my wife says , `` '' well , you may like it , but nobody else will . '' '' so she comes to the rescue . ''
and i like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there .
he did n't test so well , but i like him .
at that time , beanie babies was a big hit , and we thought , we 'll do a bunch of different ones .
and then they looked like little garfields there .
they actually wound up doing about 40 million furbys .
and hasbro made about , you know , a billion and a half dollars .
and it 's , of course , for your kids .
and she still actually has those .
and then i started another company .
and we 're going to try to really pull this off , intentfully try to make something that seems like it 's alive .
and the picture from the book , so when i — i told the sculptor to use this bump pattern , whatever you can to copy that .
there 's the skull , there 's my drawing of a skull .
there 's the skull , pretty much the same shape as the camarasaurus .
john sosoka is our cto , and is really the man that 's done most of the work with our 40-person company .
( applause ) so , thank you , john , thank you , and get back to work , all right , man ?
so this one , this one 's actually asleep , and — hang on .
they 're just cute , right ? that 's the idea , that 's the idea .
and we have a — i have a little something here .
we 've just opened the door , and it 's for all of you to step through it .
`` we have one animator who 's taken it and he 's done a take on the budweiser beer commercial , and they 're going , `` '' whassup , '' '' you know ? ''
( laughter ) you — so it 's — yes , he likes that .
i do n't know what i 'm missing to say , but as a last thing , i 'd like to say is that if we continue along this path , we are designing our children 's best friends .
( applause )
but you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together .
you are a healer in a stone age village .
`` but you think to yourself , `` '' i 'm not quite sure what 's wrong with this guy . ''
we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery .
now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond .
and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries , wandering around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .
but there was a pretty big problem with this .
`` the question had to be asked , `` '' well , can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions ? '' '' laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instruments through small incisions . ''
some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years , but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s , when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that , that allowed this to be done for real operations .
now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle .
and now , in contrast to the laparoscopy , you can precisely place the needle in your instruments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory .
and the robot is moving these instruments around , and powering them , down inside the body .
this is all done in between the ribs .
`` so , smartypants , why is n't all surgery being done this way ? '' '' and there are some reasons , some good reasons . ''
now , to do that , we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube , like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video .
but it 's all coming in through one incision .
we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream , so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart , we can see if we actually made the connection , before we close that patient back up again — something that we have n't been able to do without radiation before .
but you care about nerves , if you are a surgical patient .
i 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that crowd , i have to say .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
people were going crazy .
( laughter ) but these stories bothered me , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i did .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
the result of that has been disastrous .
does n't happen very much .
does n't happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
no fear , no agony . polio — puff , gone .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
why ? because we do n't have polio . and you know what ?
it 's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
you end up in thabo mbeki south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
now we can do it in a more precise way — and there are risks , absolutely — but we can put something like vitamin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
we do n't want companies owning seeds .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very deadening , and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
this is about moving genes around . it 's not about chemicals .
our emotions influence every aspect of our lives , from our health and how we learn , to how we do business and make decisions , big ones and small .
yet despite this intimacy , my laptop had absolutely no idea how i was feeling .
those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions , and our starting point was the human face .
another example is action unit 4. it 's the brow furrow .
it 's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles .
they look somewhat similar , but they mean very different things .
as you can see , the algorithm has essentially found cloe 's face , so it 's this white bounding box , and it 's tracking the main feature points on her face , so her eyebrows , her eyes , her mouth and her nose .
but we call each reading an emotion data point , and then they can fire together to portray different emotions .
so that 's joy . joy fires up .
try to remember what it was like when zayn left one direction .
thank you .
and i invite you all to be part of the conversation .
in so doing , i reached a frontier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
this vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria , which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide .
it 's been estimated that a single ton of soil — fertile soil — contains approximately four million species of bacteria , all unknown .
as we move past the relatively gigantic mammals , birds , frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity ?
some serious biologists , and i count myself among them , have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms , one might — just might — find aliens among them .
we will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence — and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy .
i is for the invasive species like the fire ants , the zebra mussels , broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country , and at an exponential rate — that 's the i .
only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status .
that 's in the united states .
we are , in short , flying blind into our environmental future .
we urgently need to change this .
it makes all key information about life on earth accessible to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
i was a student in the '60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
it can give credit to sound decision-making , adding momentum to success .
a destroyed tank belonging to somoza 's national guard was left as a monument in a park in managua , and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child .
in the '90s , after the breakup of the soviet union , yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines , and civil war broke out between bosnia , croatia and serbia .
the bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
i had to use it , channel its energy , turn it into something that would clarify my vision , instead of clouding it .
he had not given up , and if he did n't give up , how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope ?
i think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world .
children who could n't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages .
by the age of 12 or 14 , they 'd become beggars and drug addicts .
a boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine .
and those resources are going away .
nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
and there is one reaction that 's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do .
if you can get something to about 150 million degrees , things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration , this will happen , and it will release energy .
and that 's the way you make your tritium .
this is basically why we would bother to do it .
and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years , and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .
and we get within about the same price as current electricity .
so , how would we make it ?
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
we hold it with a magnetic field .
because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the earth .
it gets very expensive to do this research .
`` [ `` '' rebecca newberger goldstein '' '' ] [ `` '' steven pinker '' '' ] [ `` '' the long reach of reason '' '' ] cabbie : twenty-two dollars . steven pinker : okay . ''
we 're living in an era of scientific creationism , 9/11 conspiracy theories , psychic hotlines , and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism .
sp : but is this necessarily a bad thing ?
my fellow psychologists have shown that we 're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact .
you 're not threatening us or bribing us , suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest .
you show up for that debate and you 've already lost it .
can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste ?
rng : all on its own , the answer is no , but it does n't take much to switch it to yes .
that 's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work , and it 's obviously present in all of us .
and if you look at the history of moral progress , you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel .
few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children .
rng : oh , they did . here 's the french theologian sebastian castellio making the case .
if the matter is certain , to whom is it so ? to calvin ?
rng : but the ball got rolling a century before .
rng : and the persecution of homosexuals .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
sp : still , in every case , it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole .
it kind of makes you wonder about our own time .
sp : the possession of nuclear weapons .
and studies show that americans say that most do n't know a muslim .
i 'm an introvert .
i see myself in it . i feel that god knows me .
( laughter ) i later had a child , after getting married , and i was living essentially the egyptian-american dream .
not only had my country been attacked , but in a flash , somebody else 's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect .
`` and then i was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national muslim organizations saying things like , `` '' be alert , '' '' `` '' be aware , '' '' `` stay in well-lit areas , '' `` do n't congregate . '' ''
guess what ? so was i .
muslims , like all other americans , are n't a tumor in the body of america , we 're a vital organ .
muslims are inventors and teachers , first responders and olympic athletes .
it might free up some parking spots , but it will not end terrorism .
so if we want to prevent radicalization , we have to keep people going to the mosque .
( applause ) and assigning collective guilt is n't just about having to explain yourself all the time .
if we do n't do that , we 're going to get the generation we deserve .
and we , as now the elite , parents , librarians , professionals , whatever it is , a bunch of our activities are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as broadly as we can .
`` carved above their door is , `` '' free to all . '' '' it 's kind of an inspiring statement , and i 'll go back at the end of this . ''
i think we have the opportunity to one-up the greeks .
it 's not easy to one-up the greeks . but with the industriousness of the egyptians , they were able to build the library of alexandria — the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world .
and a book , if you had a book , is about a megabyte , so — you know , if you had it in microsoft word .
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that 's about this big , on spinning linux drives , and it costs about 60,000 dollars .
there 's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways , and you can search them , make little tabs , and it 's kind of cute — still very book-like — on your laptop .
and it turns out to not be very hard .
we actually went off to make a bookmobile .
and being from the silicon valley , sort of utopian sort of world , we thought , if we can make this technology work in rural uganda , we might have something .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they 're digitized , but we did n't know how to quite get them digitized .
and so we 've tried that , and i 'll go over that in a moment .
so here 's one of the beta units and you can — it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader .
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good .
well , they did n't . they did n't want to send their books .
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well — sort of these auto-page-turning things .
so you basically do a beautiful , respectful job .
yes , it costs tens of millions , low hundreds of millions , but one time shot and we 've got basically the history of printed literature online .
and then , there 's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
if you give something to a charity or to the public , you get a pat on the back and a tax donation — except on the net , where you can go broke .
we have about 40,000 concerts , everything the grateful dead ever did , up on the net , so that people can see it and listen to this material .
we 've got a lot of collections now — a couple hundred thousand items — and it 's growing over time .
as best we can tell , there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution . it 's just not that many .
but half of those were indian .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
we 've been archiving the world wide web since 1996 .
so , we should put it in the san andreas fault line in san francisco , flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east . right , so anyway ...
this is real afm — atomic force microscope — data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center .
you view the bond in the triangle .
it 's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom .
we 've taken this information and we 've made a mathematical model out of it .
well , along comes benjamin franklin , and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite .
so they got very interested in producing convulsions , measured types of convulsions .
`` that 's not going to do anything terrible to him . '' '' so they did that . ''
`` he said , `` '' this fellow '' '' — remember , he was n't even put to sleep — `` '' after this major grand mal convulsion , sat right up , looked at these three fellas and said , 'what the fuck are you assholes trying to do ? ' `` `` ( laughter ) if i could only say that in italian . ''
and to their amazement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
it did n't work very well on the schizophrenics , but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very , very effective in the treatment of depression .
they would anesthetize people , convulse them , but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles .
and so the whole idea of electroconvulsive , electroshock therapy disappeared , but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years .
now , why am i telling you this story at this meeting ?
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
so , as things got worse , as we really began to hate each other , i became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years , trying to save this marriage , which was inevitably not to be saved .
and anybody who 's been depressed here knows what that 's like .
as my referrals began to decrease , i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought , my god , i ca n't work anymore .
and , in fact , it did n't make any difference because i did n't have any patients anymore .
and it was clear — not to me , because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore — that i would need long-term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital .
all the senior staff got together , and i later found out what happened .
you 've seen this painting by edvard munch , the scream . every moment was a scream .
and you know , of course , what 'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy .
and you know why they agreed ? they agreed to humor him .
eight did n't work . at nine , i noticed — and it 's wonderful that i could notice anything — i noticed a change . and at 10 , i noticed a real change .
but , lo and behold , by 16 , by 17 , there were demonstrable differences in the way i felt .
but i need a formula . i need some thing to say to myself when i begin thinking obsessionally , obsessively .
`` well , you know , i 'm from the bronx . i ca n't say `` '' basingstoke . '' '' but i had something better . and it was very simple . ''
i brought my wife with me , actually , to make sure i could get through this .
one might think reading these books — and i 've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this — that based on my life 's history as i 've portrayed in the books , my early life 's history , i am someone who has overcome adversity .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
there is redemption . and there is resurrection .
it confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we ca n't do today , things today that we could n't do yesterday .
and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills .
all it takes for example in the sound domain , is exposure to sound .
the sound does n't have to be valuable to the animal : i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable , like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child .
or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound .
i do n't have to be in a behavioral context .
and in this epoch , which extends from late in the first year of life to death ; it 's actually doing this under behavioral control .
it is the basis of our real differentiation , one individual from another .
it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence in marseilles .
and that is indicated in the pink . we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger .
monkey has like you have .
and yet now it 's represented in substantially finer grain .
and that is an unknown — unsuspected , maybe , by you — part of acquiring the skill or ability .
because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context .
it 's what you pay attention to .
it 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you .
that is why you , in your many skills and abilities , are a unique specialist : a specialist that 's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ; enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago .
and that 's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time .
now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that 's occurred in your brain is you .
it 's constructed . it 's created in your brain .
so the first example i 'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that .
that 's disappeared . that no longer applies .
well , it was understood by a dutch surgeon , about 35 years ago , that if you simply fix the problem early enough , when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately , in this initial set up time in the critical period , none of that happens .
it 's not japanese .
it can also happen in the brain .
changing it in detail . it takes about 30 hours on the average .
and learning modulation and control is deteriorating .
and in older age conditions like parkinsonism , and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia .
your issues as it relates to this science , is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine .
it will be a long time before they really understand it .
i can not forget them .
no one was ever sentenced for these crimes .
we also need to demand justice .
when it happens to you , there is no time for thinking , no time for praying .
it took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me , but that someone , somewhere , had ordered my kidnapping .
i always dreamt of the fifth one .
the consequence was moderate : he threw the food into my waste .
the length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape : 15 songs , 45 minutes .
he talked to me about his children .
he was young , he was shy .
well , explaining why we do this is not that easy , even to our closest relatives .
we ca n't do otherwise .
this has changed .
baghdad , august 2003 : 24 colleagues were killed .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
i do n't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me .
i do n't know what it is to lose the protection of my country .
i was received with a lot of support that i got from my relatives , from colleagues , from friends , from people i did n't know .
i can not forget anything .
i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected .
`` after my ordeal , a lot of colleagues asked me , `` '' but why do you continue ? ''
`` i went to my school kitchen , and i said , `` '' give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . '' '' i went to the local baker and took their stale bread . ''
i went to the local greengrocer , and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets .
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption , and that i was only scratching the surface , and that right the way up the food supply chain , in supermarkets , greengrocers , bakers , in our homes , in factories and farms , we were hemorrhaging out food .
supermarkets did n't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting .
there will always be waste . i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste-free world .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
in many ways , this is a great success story of human civilization , of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago .
potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect , all going for pigs .
liver , lungs , heads , tails , kidneys , testicles , all of these things which are traditional , delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste . offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last 30 years .
a chef came to talk to me , i finished my bowl , and halfway through the conversation , he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl .
`` i thought , `` '' my goodness , what taboo have i broken ? ''
if you cook food for pigs , just as if you cook food for humans , it is rendered safe .
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste , to anaerobic digestion , which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity , you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste . it 's much better to feed it to pigs .
and ok , so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac , you know , but really it 's the kind of same old crap we 've had for the last , you know , 30 years .
and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk .
it 's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .
so you can bump things — they 're all physically , you know , manipulable and stuff .
and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
but sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
a language dies every 14 days .
now , at the same time , english is the undisputed global language .
but i do know that i 've seen a lot of changes .
but nevertheless , i was recruited by the british council , along with about 25 other teachers .
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
but if you 're not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
i ask you , what happened to translation ?
`` now you might think , you and me , `` those fees are n't bad , they 're okay , '' but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people . ''
so immediately , we 're rejecting them .
because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the western universities , that i put on earlier .
they really did n't know what to do , until along came a german scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb , whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does german .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men , bill gates and warren buffett , and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of the u.s. population , 120 million people .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
what 's driving it , and what can we do about it ?
in practice , getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult .
but if crony capitalism is , intellectually at least , the easy part of the problem , things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality .
for the first time in history , if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product , you have almost instant , almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people .
but today , that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy .
and that 's because , in contrast with crony capitalism , so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive .
i love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium .
again , this is no mere hypothetical .
the result is something that economists alan krueger and miles corak call the great gatsby curve .
as income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
to be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats , we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change .
in every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path .
`` how can we go to a greater battle ? '' '' he said , `` '' that is the battle of the self , the battle of the ego . '' '' the sources of human problems have to do with egotism , `` '' i . '' '' the famous sufi master rumi , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he knocks on the door , and a voice answers , `` '' who 's there ? '' '' `` it 's me , '' or , more grammatically correctly , `` it is i , '' as we might say in english . ''
why ? because the soul , the human soul , embodies a piece of the divine breath , a piece of the divine soul .
this is what i understand from my faith tradition , and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
now , take turkey 's gezi park protests , july 2013 , which i went back to study in the field .
it was everywhere in the park — well , along with a lot of tear gas .
one frustrated journalist could not take this anymore .
better , they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media .
and think of more recent initiatives , like the # bringbackourgirls hashtags .
and the logistical tasks were daunting , because these were poor people .
they had to get to work , boycott or no , so a massive carpool was organized , again by meeting .
they had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going .
but again , consider this : the civil rights movement in the united states navigated a minefield of political dangers , faced repression and overcame , won major policy concessions , navigated and innovated through risks .
europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests , but the continent did n't shift its direction .
today 's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges .
to be sure , governments have different resources to bring to the table .
and there are many efforts .
it was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under .
it does n't look like this ; it really looks more like this .
`` and if we want to avoid `` '' success-to-failure-syndrome , '' '' we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it 's how we sustain it . ''
so here is to your continued success .
people do get hiv because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .
it was someone 's birthday , and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail , and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues .
so you 've got this massive mismatch ; everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get hiv , but they 're all sharing anyway .
so , in indonesia at this time , if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up , they could put you into jail .
for once , your incentives are aligned .
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
here , maybe you 'll have better luck .
i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing , whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing , but we 'll leave that be .
the truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
in most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries .
no one wants it .
this , for example , this gentleman is called joseph .
this is also in haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex , perhaps .
`` let 's just stop treating people . '' '' of course not , of course not . ''
that 's simply not necessarily true , and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now .
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .
and both in heterosexuals — mostly in commercial sex — and in drug users , you 've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins , and that 's because of that alignment of incentives that i talked about earlier .
okay , ines .
it 's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what 's rational for every frankie and every ines out there , but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv .
you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other , from one group of nests to the next .
and we 've also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of mankind through dna genetic profiling .
and it was a paleontologist , the late louis leakey , who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees .
and of course , behavior does n't fossilize .
well , if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution , you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved , based on the behavior of chimpanzees .
chimpanzees do n't have a spoken language . we 've talked about that .
`` `` '' how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees , when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive ? '' '' more people are living there than the land could possibly support . ''
and very poor people — they could n't afford to buy food from elsewhere .
this led to a program , which we call tacare .
it 's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .
it started small with 12 villages . it 's now in 24 .
what 's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages , instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys — and by the way , many of the staff are now tanzanian — but when we began the tacare program , it was a tanzanian team going into the villages .
we 're replicating it in other parts of africa , around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure .
and what 's happened ? i mean , the question here is , here we are , arguably the most intelligent being that 's ever walked planet earth , with this extraordinary brain , capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these ted conferences , and yet we 're destroying the only home we have .
all around the world climates are mixed up .
but basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups .
and unwanted pregnancies and things like that , which young people listen to better from other youth , rather than adults .
and i 've just been so thrilled , finally , to come to people talking about compost latrines .
it 's one of my hobbyhorses .
this change , this change . to see change that we must have if we care about the future .
and an example is the tacare program .
she said it 's helped her to do what she 's doing .
and it was very , very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people , when they are empowered , given the opportunity to take action , to make the world a better place , truly are our hope for tomorrow .
now we 're a long way away from that goal right now .
so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .
at the next regularly scheduled election , pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you ca n't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
and shortly thereafter , on january 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
the other place that 's very interested in city building is singapore .
they 've got a site ; they 're already thinking about this site for the second city .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job — sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
first , it enables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescope , for me , is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go .
we 're going to have a personal universe .
the whole resources are there available for you .
and so worldwide telescope will be available this spring .
and so , what you 've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the ted lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off . ( laughter ) so we 'll see you there . thank you .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
so contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we did n't have to worry about it , this disaster is still unfolding .
it 's still working its way up the food chain .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
our leaders barrel into wars , telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades .
and when it inevitably does , the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot — in this case , throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole .
another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .
now both of these options — the boy genius and the scammer — are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .
now i 'm not going to belabor this point , but studies do show that , as investors , women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men , precisely because , as we 've already heard , women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do .
here 's what i 'm talking about .
whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature — the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation .
`` it 's for motorola 's new rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , `` slap mother nature in the face . '' ''
`` the amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' '' in other words , the ocean is big ; she can take it . ''
and it 's also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system , one that can not survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers .
the earth always did have limits .
they were just beyond our sights .
there are still no limits .
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal , the likes of which we have n't yet seen .
tar sand 's oil is solid , mixed in with the soil .
so to get at it , you first have to get rid of the trees .
there 's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs .
so that 's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine .
interestingly , this is a book that was published back in 1938 .
but if i were to point to three challenges , the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time .
many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
so we can actually use biomaterials now .
and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue , which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope .
another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
so we can take these liver structures , which are not going to be used , and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away .
that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
this particular printer we 're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient .
and this actually shows that printing .
i was missing school . it was pretty much miserable .
i was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
and this surgery came along and basically made me who i am today and saved my life .
i am a plant geneticist .
now , take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana .
although rice grows well in standing water , most rice varieties will die if they 're submerged for more than three days .
he asked if i would be willing to help them isolate this gene .
i love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers .
cornell and bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach .
this is the same pigment that we find in carrots .
when i heard about the destruction , i wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project , that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives .
in all that time , there has n't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment .
thank you .
farmers there can not afford the seed .
i feel it 's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product , and think about the needs of the consumer .
it 's making something that 's pure dangerous in some way , and i think you 're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is .
pr : that 's absolutely true , and there 's no such thing as pure food .
( applause )
jake : hey guys .
`` [ `` '' 'alice 's adventures in wonderland ' ( 1972 ) '' '' ] alice : what 's happening to me ? ''
however , what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated .
and if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in , what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain .
and if we give antidepressants , then we increase the production of these newborn neurons , and we decrease the symptoms of depression , establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression .
but moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant .
increasing ?
indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis .
however , it 's all about balance here .
and then finally , how about running ?
( applause ) margaret heffernan : fantastic research , sandrine .
but people think it 's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows , when in reality , it looks more something like this .
well , it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage .
`` see , a lot of people look at this and they say , `` oh yeah , wow , that 's a pretty tree . '' ''
and so we 've treated them as these second-class ecosystems , because they have very little monetary value and of course , they 're known to harbor alligators and snakes — which , i 'll admit , these are n't the most cuddly of ambassadors .
and so after the spring , after they raise their young , they then fly thousand of miles over the gulf of mexico into central and south america .
how often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable , or consider that the world may not have been made for just us ?
the emerald gem of the everglades , the great estuary , the 850 square-mile estuary .
so no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water .
and unfortunately , that 's precisely what we 've done .
over the last 60 years , we have drained , we have dammed , we have dredged the everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today .
and just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century — shooting up to 900 , 1,000 , 1,100 , 1,200 — just as that started happening , we started draining the southern everglades .
it is resilient .
and fortunately , after decades of debate , we 're finally starting to act on those questions .
we 're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay .
take your friends out , take your kids out , take your family out .
and we 've come a long way in the last 60 years .
can we do it ? will we do it ?
it 's also a gift , and ultimately , our responsibility .
ss : when aimee got there , she decided that she 's , kind of , curious about track and field , so she decided to call someone and start asking about it .
so , why do n't you tell that story ?
`` and he said , `` '' well , we should meet first , before we decide anything . '' '' you know , he 's thinking , `` '' what am i getting myself into ? '' '' so , i met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached . ''
and we got to talking , and it turned out to be a great partnership because he 'd never coached a disabled athlete , so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what i was or was n't capable of , and i 'd never been coached before .
and i went out there and made it to the big east , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .
`` you pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race ! '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and i did . so , he kept me in line . ''
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
( laughter ) no , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful .
you 've got to come up and see them .
( laughter ) patrick ewing , who played for georgetown in the '80s , comes back every summer .
am : yeah , i definitely have to be moving , and balance is a little bit of an art in them .
so when i stand in these legs , my hamstring and my glutes are contracted , as they would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .
( audience : who made them ? ) am : it 's a company in san diego called flex-foot .
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it 's like a big — it 's come full circle .
it 's like a barbie foot under this .
i do n't know how good you can see it , but , like , it really is .
( applause )
technology has brought us so much : the moon landing , the internet , the ability to sequence the human genome .
orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us , and huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance .
( laughter ) so then you have to think about , well , how do people talk about electronic cigarettes ?
so did these ads that the cdc put on , these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing , did they actually have an impact on whether people quit ?
but i actually think there 's a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said , because facts are stubborn things , but sometimes they 're stupid , too .
`` and he looked at me very seriously and said , `` typed in the box . '' ''
and when you think about it , it makes a lot of sense , because forming a question is a really complex process , but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box .
and they 're vulnerable to misuse , willful or otherwise .
and of course mothers , because .
because after all , if i can spot a problem in an argument , it does n't much matter whether it 's expressed in words or in numbers .
as my high school algebra teacher used to say , show your math , because if i do n't know what steps you took , i do n't know what steps you did n't take , and if i do n't know what questions you asked , i do n't know what questions you did n't ask .
what we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the health media collaboratory , and as they say in the superhero movies , let 's use our powers for good .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
it 's a lot .
so that 's the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
jk : both .
no , that 's what i thought .
and it 's also very risky .
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
`` while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , `` '' are you fresh enough for this interview ? ''
i want to help you calm down .
`` whether it 's a `` '' floral fusion '' '' or a `` '' paradise winds , '' '' they 'll have their chance . ''
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challenger brand .
so doing things like this — you know , remind people about ban — is kind of why were interested in it .
man : we talk about bold , fresh .
i do n't know .
man 2 : the brand that i am is , i would call it casual fly .
so i guess that 's my brand .
a : how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
ms : eeeeee ! ( a : thank you . ) no , thank you .
lindsay zaltman : the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but complementary sides to your brand personality — the morgan spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they 're using mri 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing .
`` i 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to get people thinking , that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world . '' '' and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ? ''
we 've got to put that bear in a cage .
`` and that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , `` '' embrace transparency , '' '' has been brought to you by my good friends at emc , who for $ 7,100 bought the naming rights on ebay . ''
so let me start in on that problem .
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina , diseases like macular degeneration , and there 's little that can be done for them .
here you have a retina .
and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . and when i say code , i do literally mean code .
anyway , you get the idea .
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina 's output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
and so the encoder does just what i was saying : it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry — so it takes images in and converts them into the retina 's code .
so i 'm just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this , and of course i 've got a lot of other data , so if you 're interested i 'm happy to show more . so the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it 's much better . not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face , but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face , which is a really challenging task .
so on the left is the encoder alone , and on the right is from an actual blind retina , so the encoder and the transducer .
on the most part , we were producing biogas , biogas for rural kitchens .
but as the gender-sensitive person that i am , i would like to call it bullshit .
so we are speaking about transformation , transformation in rural areas .
villages that agree to implement this project , they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and , later on , who look after the operation and maintenance .
sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste .
and for that , they come together , collect all the local materials — local materials like rubble , sand , aggregates , usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement , steel , toilet commode .
from the toilet , the muck comes into the first leach pit .
and when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
so no water is stored . it 's always on tap .
but after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages — 1,200 villages have completed it — waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
so this is a democracy in action because there is a general body , a governing board , the committee .
and i hope it continues to move ahead .
a magazine ?
this is margaret bourke-white 's — one of her pictures she did .
fantastic , glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places .
well , one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary .
and over the years , around the turn of the 20th century , it started to take on this other kind of deception — this definition for any artificial interest in , or association with , an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified .
but still , glamour is an illusion .
there was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour .
so you 've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth — it was a portrait of a star .
and it involves a great deal of technique .
glamour does n't have to be people .
this is filippino lippi 's 1543 portrait of saint apollonia .
aside from alex ross 's style , which is very glamorous , one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly .
glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized , perfect place .
the notion is that it 's going to transport you , and the story is not about , you know , the guy in front of you in the airplane , who has this nasty little kid , or the big cough .
staircases that curve away from you are glamorous .
i happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because , to me , it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life — but maybe that 's because i went to princeton .
anyway , skylines are super glamorous , city streets — not so glamorous .
there are few things more glamorous than the horizon — except , possibly , multiple horizons .
and i remember reading , after the lara croft movies , how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue .
of course , they covered that with make-up , because lara croft did all those same stunts — but she does n't get black and blue , because she has sprezzatura .
glamour is about editing .
how do you create the sense of transcendence , the sense of evoking a perfect world ?
you have to have mystery and you have to have grace .
the white picket fence , the perfect house .
the perfect office — again , no cords , as far as i can tell .
this is from soviet union . attractive .
i think glamour has a genuine appeal , has a genuine value .
so i discovered some very interesting things .
in the 17th century , a doodle was a simpleton or a fool — as in yankee doodle .
and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom .
i think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we 're almost blinded to the value of doodling .
so here 's a new definition for doodling .
this is so nerdy , but this made me cry when i discovered this .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
and finally , a lot a people are n't privy to this , but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets .
`` this is a famous quote of his : `` '' every block of stone has a statue inside of it , and the job of the sculptor is to discover it . '' '' so i think that what michelangelo was getting at is that we create by perceiving , and that perception itself is an act of imagination and is the stuff of creativity . ''
because unlike , say , the heart or the intestines , you really ca n't say very much about a brain by just looking at it , at least with the naked eye .
and from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices , one can start to make reconstructions in 3d of neurons that look like these .
so these are sort of in the same style as ramón y cajal .
those characterize the computational properties of this network .
there are three variables .
so this process of learning , of solving for w , if we were doing this with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers , we know exactly how to do that : 6 = 2 x w , well , we divide by two and we 're done .
and the way to do that is fairly straightforward .
so now , we 've held x and w fixed to solve for y ; that 's everyday , fast perception .
in other words , you know that it 's a bird , and you already have your neural network that you 've trained on birds , but what is the picture of a bird ?
`` this was a work made by mike tyka in our group , which he calls `` '' animal parade . '' '' it reminds me a little bit of william kentridge 's artworks , in which he makes sketches , rubs them out , makes sketches , rubs them out , and creates a movie this way . ''
this is what happens if alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to reconstruct my own face .
when you 're solving for x , you can begin with an x , that is itself already some other image .
and finally , computing began as an exercise in designing intelligent machinery .
and i think that computing is not just about accounting or playing candy crush or something .
and they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better and to extend them .
`` it was for a law firm recruitment dinner , and i remember beforehand the waitress walked around and asked whether we wanted some wine , so i said , `` '' sure , i 'll take some white wine . '' '' and she immediately said , `` would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay ? '' ''
so i had a lot of experiences like that during my first couple of years as a law student at yale , because , despite all outward appearances , i 'm a cultural outsider .
i did n't come from the northeast or from san francisco .
i had a very front-row seat to that struggle .
there was a sense that kids had that their choices did n't matter .
you see it as something that 's actively conspiring , where people with political and financial power are working against you .
i remember i learned this when i got the financial aid letter from yale for myself , tens of thousands of dollars in need-based aid , which is a term i had never heard before .
these are all instances of childhood trauma , and they 're pretty commonplace in my family .
so my grandparents , the very first time that they had kids , they expected that they were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good .
my mom was 12 when she saw my grandma set my grandfather on fire .
we know what happens to the kids who experience that life .
my grandma especially did two things that really matter .
we need to ask questions about how we give social capital , mentorship to low-income kids who do n't have it .
there 's a kid whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out , and he does n't know why she does n't cook him dinner , and he goes to bed hungry that night .
they just want somebody to show it to them .
i was the freak of the family .
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
if we 're blind to this simple biology , imagine what we 're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels .
this is why i 'm launching a new initiative .
`` i 'm calling my initiative , `` take the other to lunch . '' ''
and what might happen at your lunch ?
it 's two people , two warriors , dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other .
this is why wars get fought .
now , we evolved in rather more challenging times than these , in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws .
and this was the sort of constraint that i found myself bumping up against .
to conquer uncertainty , to know what comes next , that 's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies , and having got there , or almost got there , we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs .
first , of course , they killed some of the deer , but that was n't the major thing .
much more significantly , they radically changed the behavior of the deer .
the number of songbirds , of migratory birds , started to increase greatly .
whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide-ranging effects .
but the opposite happened .
you take the whales away , and the number of krill collapses .
why would that possibly have happened ?
it does n't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef .
i believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology , as we 're doing now , but at the same time , if we choose , have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful , rewilded habitats .
perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost megafauna .
all these species lived here in the last interglacial period , when temperatures were pretty similar to our own .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
and perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us , the most important thing that 's missing from our lives : hope .
in motivating people to love and defend the natural world , an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair .
we are doing a thousand now .
the idea is , let 's have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal — about half a second — let 's see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
well , we did that 10 years ago .
and you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar .
what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to duke , so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her .
so she could be rewarded , not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity .
millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action , into movement .
although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements , they can not cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord .
and then there 's a coastal plain along the mediterranean , where tel aviv is now .
and he 's so terrifying that none of the israelite soldiers want to fight him .
there 's cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target .
it 's not this , right ? it 's not a child 's toy .
it 's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
that 's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers .
there 's all kinds of hints of this in the biblical text , things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and do n't square with his image as this mighty warrior .
here is this mighty warrior challenging the israelites to one-on-one combat .
and sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
when dorothy was a little girl , she was fascinated by her goldfish .
five : i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices .
which fact is not true ?
( applause ) at this point , most people really only care about the television show .
( laughter ) i know this from experience .
`` ok , so the show was nbc 's `` '' saved by the bell : the new class . '' '' and i played weasel wyzell , who was the sort of dorky , nerdy character on the show , which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy . ''
it 's immediate and passive .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience .
that 's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing .
let 's take fear as just one example .
your fears distort your reality .
fear replaces the unknown with the awful .
when i was diagnosed with my blinding disease , i knew blindness would ruin my life .
recognize your assumptions .
correct your misconceptions about luck and about success .
accept your strengths and your weaknesses , and understand the difference .
your fears , your critics , your heroes , your villains — they are your excuses , rationalizations , shortcuts , justifications , your surrender .
with that empowerment comes complete responsibility .
i chose to build there a blessed life .
for me , going blind was a profound blessing , because blindness gave me vision .
this is an audience of entrepreneurs , of doers , of innovators .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
it went like this .
as for me , disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth , i went to america and became a berkeley hippie .
this one went as follows : all societies , regardless of culture , be it christian , muslim , confucian , must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units , and all these individuals are , by definition , rational , and they all want one thing : the vote .
yet , according to the grand story , none of this should be happening .
well , the assumptions are wrong .
adaptability , meritocracy , and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of china 's one-party system .
now , this may be counterintuitive to you .
just to show you how competitive the system is , in 2012 , there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels , 600,000 fuchu and chu levels , and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels .
this is not a put-down of anyone . it 's just a statement of fact .
`` i was asked once , `` '' the party was n't voted in by election . ''
now , i 'm a venture capitalist . i make bets .
let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives .
perhaps a more interesting age is upon us .
are we brave enough to welcome it ?
i think many here , and in general in western countries , would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional , but at the same time , many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that , without any form of oversight or consultation , decides what the national interest is .
are you happy with the garbage collection ?
and many of you out there are the heads of macromedia and microsoft , and in a way those are my bane : i think there 's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what 's possible on the computer .
( applause ) we 've got about a minute left .
i did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths .
i 'm overtime , so i just wanted to say you can , if you 're in new york , you can check out my work at the whitney biennial next week , and also at bitforms gallery in chelsea .
actually , it was exhausting .
it turns out that we 're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science , one that 's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man .
`` we see some food that looks good , our brain says , `` '' calories ! ... survival ! '' '' we eat the food , we taste it — it tastes good . ''
see food , eat food , feel good , repeat .
same process , just a different trigger .
i 'll give you an example .
`` she said , `` '' mindful smoking : smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals , yuck ! '' '' now , she knew , cognitively that smoking was bad for her , that 's why she joined our program . ''
and it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior , to help us stop smoking , to help us stop eating that second , that third , that fourth cookie .
we 're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we 're stressed out or tired , even though we know it 's not going to be helpful .
when the prefrontal cortex goes offline , we fall back into our old habits , which is why this disenchantment is so important .
and this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity , which is naturally rewarding .
and what happens when we get curious ?
these are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge , scary craving that we choke on .
and when we studied the brains of experienced meditators , we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play .
in contrast , when we let go — step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what 's happening — this same brain region quiets down .
now , remember that bit about context-dependent memory ?
i admit the sight of the leash would excite me , but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched .
`` you always scratched me in the wrong place . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' all i ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls . ''
and so we spent a summer looking at different play-doh recipes .
but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together .
but our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play-doh .
it 's like a wall to the electricity .
if i want a spinning tail , let 's grab a motor , put some play-dough on it , stick it on and we have spinning .
we call this our sushi circuit . it 's very popular with kids .
so this is all in your home kitchen .
we do n't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers , but maybe we should .
nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments .
`` he said , `` '' but here 's the problem : if i let you in , the other tenants will move out and i ca n't afford to take that kind of a hit . '' '' he said , `` '' i just ca n't rent to you . '' '' even though that was discouraging , it did n't stop me . ''
but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i did n't have a lot of other options .
four years after that , i received papers to move from mountain home , idaho to a place called goose bay , labrador .
she kind of looked at them . no one said anything .
`` and i told my mother and i told my wife and also melanie , and i said , `` '' it looks like we 're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight . '' '' and we did drive down the road , but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot , guess what happened ? ''
they 're almost there but not quite . ( laughter ) i have one who has been in college now for eight years . ( laughter )
he does n't have a degree yet , but he wants to be a comedian .
we have to challenge that . it does n't make any sense .
three years ago , i argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges .
let 's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like .
and boy , did they print .
`` the bank of japan repeated those words — that exact same commitment — to do `` '' whatever it takes '' '' to reflate their economy . ''
it 's been one of the most successful funds of its type , raising almost 10 billion dollars .
so , for example , the issuance of these extra sdrs every five years could be capped , such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves .
i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience .
some are driven by compassion , feel it 's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
this is a picture of me and my three children .
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
but it never struck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no milk to nurse .
and the baby 's cry really penetrated me , as a mother .
but today i 'm going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories .
in 2008 , lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days — from conception to two years old — does not have adequate nutrition , the damage is irreversible .
i 'd like to talk about some of the things i 've seen on the front lines of hunger , some of the things i 've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector .
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
we know this .
you manage , the village manages these warehouses .
and they 're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village .
and simple ideas can transform the face , not of small areas , of big areas of the world .
well this picture — i was in hebron in a small shop , this shop , where instead of bringing in food , we provide digital food , a card .
and what 's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry — where this card 's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus — the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent .
now you 'd ask , can this be done at scale ?
and they 're doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day .
and the fact that france has put food at the center of the g20 is really important .
wfp 's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .
i am so honored to be here with some of the world 's top innovators and thinkers .
these include the boston marathon bombings in 2013 , as well as failed attacks , such as the time when a man named faisal shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to times square .
never another attack on american soil .
these informants nab people like abu khalid abdul-latif and walli mujahidh .
the fbi 's informant was robert childs , a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid 90,000 dollars for his work on the case .
in 2009 , an fbi informant who had fled pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb synagogues in the bronx .
there are many more examples .
ta : well so far , we only know what 's come out in the court file , but they seem to suggest it 's another example of the same .
now , 21 billion hours , it 's a lot of time .
`` but not everybody has a concussion , obviously , not everyone wants to be `` '' the slayer , '' '' so i renamed the game superbetter . ''
how are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life ?
and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day , the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day .
i lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone .
these amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself .
and this is actually not the first time this happened , because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation .
i could even search for any information by myself .
i desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet , and i found ways to render the web into synthesized voice , which dramatically simplified the user interface .
today , i am more independent , but it is still not enough .
ev : he is not talking to you , but on his phone .
ev : you gained 5 pounds since yesterday ; take apple instead of chocolate .
ca : now ...
so now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world .
this technology is only in an early stage , but eventually , i 'll be able to find a classroom on campus , enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street .
so , this really is a great challenge .
while we were there as refugees , we did n't know what was going to become of us .
then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut .
i struggled and tried to get her off me , but i could n't .
we went to senegal , then france , and then singapore .
and we saw a lot of asian people .
so fine , it 's all good .
settling in australia was quite hard , but it became harder when i started volunteering for an organization called women 's health statewide , and i joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about , or that it related to me in any way .
i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened , i did n't remember any of it .
this had happened to everybody else .
i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down .
i was a black angry woman . ( laughter ) oh yeah .
`` i 'm like , `` '' those years ago , you circumcised me . ''
i went back to school .
`` i want to do that too — `` '' oh ! oh ! '' '' and all of that . ''
`` he wo n't have that problem with me . '' '' ( laughter ) so i said to my mom , `` '' dolly and girlfriend said i deserve pleasure , and do you know what you have taken away from me , what you have denied me ? ''
`` am i going to be asexual ? '' '' because from what i knew about fgm , the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women . ''
it hurt all the time .
i know a nine-year-old girl who has incontinence , constant infections , pain .
it says we do n't have a right to our bodies .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
so three things have happened .
we 'll swap the axis .
here you have child mortality — that is , survival — four kids dying there , 200 dying there .
i think we have to go , there — we have 2001 , or 2002 — the united states has the same health as chile .
within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states .
and the volvo is doing quite fine .
( laughter ) and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
and this is when great-grandma was born , 1863 .
and this is when my grandma was born , 1891 .
and what happens when we moved on ?
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier — everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
and there we are , 2001 .
`` and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission . '' '' this really shows you , we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate . ''
and this is really what has to be changed .
and they are very , very eagerly interested to get advice , and that 's to survive in poverty .
and this woman is very happy now , bringing her products to the market .
it 's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , argentina and mozambique together 50 years ago , and says that mozambique did worse .
we are not interested in money .
and going to school , that 's not a goal , it 's a mean .
that 's the value of living .
it 's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .
and i 'm going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
( applause )
i am a ph.d. student and that means i have a question : how can we make digital content graspable ?
that 's my question .
the first one is mass .
`` so in that case — like here , there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen — the shape of the phone could tell you , `` '' okay , off the screen right here , there is more content . ''
( laughter ) and you can tell , it 's relaxed right now .
you give it a pat behind the ears , and everything is all right again .
and it is a big problem : there are 2.5 billion people in the world who do n't have access to adequate sanitation .
as you can see , there 's no protective equipment , no protective clothing .
and the answer is , it 's just not possible .
so let 's start with the human user interface .
`` they would come into the emergency room with what the police would call `` '' a lovers ' quarrel , '' '' and i would see a woman who was beaten , i would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes . ''
and for all those years , i 've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable , that it is learned , and if it 's learned , it can be un-learned , and it can be prevented .
it is absolutely true .
between 1993 and 2010 , domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by 64 percent , and that is great news .
and i remember walking through the halls of the u.s. capitol , and i was in my 30s , and my life had purpose , and i could n't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation .
i was probably 30 and naive .
and you know what else it did ? it collected data .
and we looked around the world to canada and australia and brazil and parts of africa , and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence .
( video ) man : where 's dinner ?
`` they talk to their kids as parents , as coaches . '' '' and that 's what we did . ''
we met men where they were at and we built a program .
`` and all of a sudden , he looked at the back of the room , and he saw his daughter , and he called out his daughter 's name , michaela , and he said , `` '' michaela , come up here . '' '' and she 's nine years old , and she was kind of shy , and she got up there , and he said , `` '' sit down next to me . '' '' she sat right down next to him . ''
technology has been our friend .
you ca n't make that one up .
my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called wasp ; that 's not an acronym — just somebody thought it looked like the insect .
we trained in a tank in port hueneme , and then my first open ocean dive was in santa barbara channel .
it was an evening dive .
and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that 's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye , albeit a little fuzzy .
i knew my forward speed , i knew the area , and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .
well , that was the question that 19th century french physiologist raphael dubois , asked about this bioluminescent clam .
so , what is it about bioluminescence that 's so important to so many animals ?
it 's got a built-in flashlight .
so , she 's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .
so , now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world , because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .
so i 'm holding it , and i 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when i do , you 'll see bioluminescence coming out .
for this fish , it 's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes .
and then to generate the display you 're about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that 's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish .
the primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships .
the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles .
i 've made hundreds of dives in submersibles .
thing is , in science , you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you 're going to discover before they 'll give you the money .
but i did n't know how .
`` but when our story begins , he was better known as johnny `` '' bull '' '' walker . ''
the climax of his act had gone wrong , and his head was stuck inside the lion 's mouth .
his medical colleagues did n't know his secret , either .
and he didn’t know it at the time , but over the next five decades , he 'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain .
he still wrestled in secret — he had to .
pain just kept accumulating in his life .
bonica , who was watching all this , pushed the intern out of the way , cleared her airway , and saved his wife and his unborn daughter .
at 7,700 beds , it was one of the largest army hospitals in america .
but if the injury had been treated , why would the alarm bell keep ringing ?
for the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
he recast the very purpose of medicine .
bonica 's years of wrestling caught up to him .
maybe bonica gave them medical advice .
`` this is a quote , actually , from alan turing : `` '' in 30 years , it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person . '' '' this was in 1946. and now , in 2007 , it 's still not true . ''
let 's just take a look about how the brain works , and then i 'll compare that with how computers work .
you 've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other — about 100 million of them , sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second .
the net is doing the work in the brain .
this is serial and it 's rigid — it 's like cars on a freeway , everything has to happen in lockstep — whereas this is parallel and it 's fluid .
the devices that computers use are what 's called a transistor .
and even when you close the pore — which neurons can do , they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity — even when it 's closed , because these ions are so small , they can actually sneak through , a few can sneak through at a time .
they want to compress the information — they just want to send the changes , what 's new in the image , and so on — and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve , to send to the rest of the brain .
instead of doing this in software , or doing those kinds of algorithms , we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that 's called the retina .
and so , here you go .
kwabena boahen : yes , like i said at the beginning , i got my first computer when i was a teenager , growing up in accra .
but here we are on a planet , and there are so many things that are amazing about earth that we 're searching far and wide to find things that are like that .
that 's why they 're round .
but another fundamental characteristic about planets is what you do n't see here , and that 's the star , the sun , that all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around .
so these two images of the earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen looks like , shown in red .
so it 's fine to look at pictures of mars and say that atmospheric escape probably happened , but nasa has a probe that 's currently at mars called the maven satellite , and its actual job is to study atmospheric escape .
here , for example , you can see in the red circle is the size of mars , and in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet .
and this helps us confirm ideas , like why mars is red , from that lost hydrogen .
so one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we ca n't see .
but the planets that i did want to talk about are known as transiting exoplanets .
could you have started with something like jupiter that was actually close to the sun , and get rid of all the gas in it ?
we now think that if you start with something like a hot jupiter , you actually ca n't end up with mercury or the earth .
and so what we can look forward to , or at least prepare for , is the fact that in the far future , the earth is going to look more like mars .
so do n't fear , it 's not for a few billion years , so there 's some time to prepare .
i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we 've lost — actually , we 've taken , we 've eaten — more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should concern you .
and with caring , there 's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us .
but first we have to know .
`` but i asked him : `` '' when are you going to finish it ? ''
we can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the mariana trench , where only two people have ever been .
how about some x prizes for ocean exploration ?
excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming , it 's also changing ocean chemistry , making the sea more acidic .
all of these parts are part of our life support system .
in my lifetime , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been killed .
and in 1872 , with yellowstone national park , the united states began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , national marine sanctuaries .
the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
protected areas provide hope that the creatures of ed wilson 's dream of an encyclopedia of life , or the census of marine life , will live not just as a list , a photograph , or a paragraph .
sargasso sea 's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows .
the high seas , where whales , tuna and dolphins travel — the largest , least protected , ecosystem on earth , filled with luminous creatures , living in dark waters that average two miles deep .
to cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
we need to do for the ocean what al gore did for the skies above .
you decide : how much of your heart do you want to protect ?
thank you .
so over the long course of human history , the infectious disease that 's killed more humans than any other is malaria .
it 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos , and it 's probably our oldest scourge .
we 're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos .
and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other , they have totally different physiology .
so say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite 's life cycle .
we could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live .
or say your cow does , or say your pig does , and then , say , it rains , and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water .
so this has happened historically .
this has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again .
when i told my relatives in india that i was writing a book about malaria , they kind of looked at me like i told them i was writing a book about warts or something .
like , why would you write about something so boring , so ordinary ? you know ?
most of the world 's malaria comes and goes on its own .
cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies and on our own lives , but we do n't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season .
this is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease .
and that adds up to the biggest problem of all , which , of course , is the political problem .
and so when those tools started to fail , and public opinion started to turn against those tools , they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do .
the whole campaign crashed , malaria resurged back , but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places in the most difficult-to-control forms .
this thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions .
and when you think about the bed net , it 's sort of a surgical intervention .
and they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze , even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves , even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up , even if , you know , they might live in a round hut in which it 's difficult to string up a square net .
but that 's not how people with malaria think of malaria .
and that 's what happening now .
now attacking the malarious way of life , this is something — these are things people care about today .
( applause )
infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world .
we 're not the only medical doctors .
they get sick like you . they get sick like me .
and this is really detrimental to the monarch .
they 're toxic to most animals , but not to monarchs .
we have done these experiments now over several years , and always get the same results .
i 'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does , but first i 'm going to talk a little bit about the problem .
traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago .
`` in fact , we had a porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day , `` this is completely stupid . what are we thinking ? '' ''
sure enough , the phone is charging .
it does n't apply the brakes for you , it does n't do anything goofy , but it also does n't get you out of an accident .
it does n't matter how hard i train , i 'm never actually going to get there .
the first , most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone , having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty .
now , we do n't have to deal with just ducks .
we do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day , so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have .
thank you .
on this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless — i mean , there 's a real debate going on out there right now .
so some of the companies , for example , tesla , are going the driver-assisted route .
`` what you 're saying is that that 's kind of going to be a dead end because you ca n't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point , and then a driver is going to say , `` '' this feels safe , '' '' and climb into the back , and something ugly will happen . ''
archimedes was an ancient greek thinker , and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers , we can move the world .
amongst the extreme poor , one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough .
this child matters .
you know , we see things like this , and we 're upset by them , but they seem like such big problems .
so for the next 10 minutes , let 's not be sad about the state of the world .
most of the farmers i know are actually women .
these proven tools and practices have more than tripled agricultural productivity in every major region of the world , moving mass numbers of people out of poverty .
again using the map of sub-saharan africa as an example , remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas .
anybody can give , but we need more leadership .
we are an exceptional people .
if we have the will , every one of us has a role to play .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
she was mesmerized .
`` and the richest people over there — there 's one billion people — and they live above what i call the `` '' air line , '' '' because they spend more than $ 80 a day on their consumption . ''
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
they wash like this : by hand .
and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home , or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off .
look here , two generations ago in sweden — picking water from the stream , heating with firewood and washing like that .
and they will start to use as much as the old west are doing already .
and these people , they want the washing machine .
but the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
but until they have the same energy consumption per person , they should n't give advice to others — what to do and what not to do .
they love them .
`` she said , `` '' now hans , we have loaded the laundry . ''
you get books out of the machines , children 's books .
thank you power station .
i do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , i need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage .
and you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it 's quite easy to figure out where it came from .
they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional .
it 's just that we do n't need it anymore . it 's outdated .
they 're there in thousands in every office .
well , i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
i used to teach people how to write computer programs in new delhi , 14 years ago .
( laughter ) what did the poor do wrong ?
i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one , did n't know any english , did n't know what the internet was .
`` it was three feet off the ground , and they said , `` '' what is this ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yeah , it 's , i do n't know . '' '' ( laughter ) they said , `` '' why have you put it there ? '' '' i said , `` '' just like that . '' '' and they said , `` '' can we touch it ? `` `` i said , `` '' if you wish to . '' '' and i went away . ''
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
on your right is an eight-year-old .
i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again .
i made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
tamil is a south indian language , and i said , can tamil-speaking children in a south indian village learn the biotechnology of dna replication in english from a streetside computer ?
i 'll spend a couple of months , i 'll leave it for a couple of months , i 'll go back , they 'll get another zero .
`` the children came rushing , said , `` '' what 's all this ? '' '' so i said , `` '' it 's very topical , very important . but it 's all in english . '' '' so they said , `` '' how can we understand such big english words and diagrams and chemistry ? '' '' so by now , i had developed a new pedagogical method , so i applied that . i said , `` '' i have n't the foggiest idea . '' '' ( laughter ) `` and anyway , i am going away . '' ( laughter ) ''
`` so i asked this girl , `` '' can you help them ? '' '' so she says , `` '' absolutely not . ''
( children speaking ) neurons ... communication .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
well , we know what they 're like today .
it took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become homo sapiens .
there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
but the age of empires is gone .
she goes on over skype and she sorts things out .
children : you ca n't catch me . grandmother : i 'm the gingerbread man.children : i 'm the gingerbread man . grandmother : well done ! very good . sm : so what 's happening here ? i think what we need to look at is
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i 'll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
and i was distraught .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in zambia , to this size .
`` when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything . ( laughter ) and we said to the zambians , `` '' my god , the hippos ! '' '' and the zambians said , `` '' yes , that 's why we have no agriculture here . '' '' ( laughter ) `` why did n't you tell us ? `` `` you never asked . '' ''
`` paternalistic , i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . `` `` i love you so much . '' '' patronizing , i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants . ''
this should be the first principle of aid .
you can give somebody an idea .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
so years and years ago , i had this idea : why do n't we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why do n't , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
you have to create a new profession .
`` and so what i did in esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days i had my first client , and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a maori guy , and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , `` you the guy who helped maori ? can you help us ? '' ''
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in 1860 .
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
`` so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , `` '' what do you need ? ''
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
and the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places , on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques , and would upload this to a central place .
these tools do n't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
it 's when everybody is able to take them for granted .
now that 's a big claim . i 'm going to try to back it up .
slow , text-based conversations , then real-time voice based conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
and the third big change is that members of the former audience , as dan gilmore calls them , can now also be producers and not consumers .
and because of the social connections , chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in china — there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
but they were n't given that choice , because their own citizens beat them to the punch .
`` essentially to say , `` '' we will do anything to placate you , just please stop protesting in public . '' '' but these are people who have been radicalized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation . ''
they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .
and in fact that is happening this week .
national message . targeted individuals .
very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but that 's not the really crazy change that we 're living in the middle of .
`` by the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , he said , `` '' i 've thought about the issue more . i 've changed my mind . ''
within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo.com ; within weeks of its being created it was the largest group .
nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join , to deny its existence , to delete it , to take to off the site .
and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media .
that 's the media environment we 've got .
`` the question we all face now is , `` '' how can we make best use of this media ? ''
economic growth needs capitalism , but it needs it to work properly .
this is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and , worse still , it 's increasing income inequality — the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many .
but there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies .
two very good examples of this are the 19th-century united states , when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships .
dm : again , i would be very much about being open-minded .
peter hirshberg : which is more fun , internet or tv ?
girl 5 : no .
by the way , this is about when i enter the picture .
warner , of course , writes off more than 400 million dollars .
( video ) journalist : it 's a whirlwind electronic computer .
this had the first pointing device . it was distributed , so it worked out — distributed computing and modems — so all these things could talk to each other .
if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know , say , century city , it would fit beautifully .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
`` rca had david sarnoff , who basically commercialized radio , said this , `` '' i do n't say that radio networks must die . ''
come on into the secret lab .
turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window , other crayons may discolor or hurt the window .
it led to lawsuits — ( laughter ) — federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that 's a scandal we wo n't discuss today .
ph : you know , mcluhan talked about the global village .
it 's a sort of ann landers ' column writ large .
there was women 's liberation .
here 's the apple marketing video .
( video ) james burke : you 'll be pleased to know , i 'm sure , that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
( video ) narrator : the pyramids , the colosseum , the new york subway system and tv dinners , ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all .
and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry , and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .
the world and all its culture reduced to bits , the lingua franca of all media .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
telecommunications , entertainment , computing and everything else .
he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it , and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea .
if internet one was about pages , now it 's about people .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .
i 'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own .
autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool , except that , by requiring very few people to go to war , they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands , possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy .
that 's because once you 've deployed remotely-piloted drones , there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself .
now we saw an example of this in 2011 when an american rq-170 sentinel drone got a bit confused over iran due to a gps spoofing attack , but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack , and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision-making .
data powers high-tech societies .
and these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind .
( applause ) each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed i.d . burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces .
but notice , this is more an immune system than a weapons system .
but well before my imagination was my vocation , my imagination saved my life .
and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
an author visited our school , jack gantos .
two words that made a colossal difference in my life .
`` my favorite page is the `` '' about the author '' '' page . ''
so from sixth through 12th grade , once , twice , sometimes three times a week , i would take classes at the art museum , and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw , other kids who shared a similar passion .
celebrate your own style . do n't draw the way you 're being told to draw .
i got my first piece of significant fan mail , where this kid loved monkey boy so much that he wanted to have a monkey boy birthday cake .
i have 12 minutes with you .
right now the moon is rising in the northeast .
and she was obsessed with the exact moment when i would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine .
and there is no way to be in this universe without mass .
and she threw me out .
but maybe a life has meaning only because it ends .
if you share you and your partner 's animal signs , they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life .
the chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others .
so parents choose specific years to give birth to babies , because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families .
jack ma 's parents must have been very proud .
according to the bbc and the chinese government 's press release , january 2015 saw a peak of cesarean sections .
maybe they are the lucky ones .
i went through the forbes top 300 richest people in the world , and it 's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals , the goat and tiger , are at the top of the chart , even higher than the dragon .
although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years , the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades .
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
and especially since about 2007 , when i got an iphone , i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day , but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket .
if you went and looked for images of the internet , this was all that you found , this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way , this infinite expanse where we do n't seem to be anywhere on it .
we 're always sort of small in the face of its expanse .
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . ( laughter ) and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process .
you can you hold them in your hand . they 're like a garden hose .
then you can see the english engineers looking on .
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same .
and we should know , i think , we should know where our internet comes from , and we should know what it is that physically , physically connects us all .
can we end hunger , achieve gender equality , halt climate change , all in the next 15 years ?
well , according to the governments of the world , yes we can .
watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards , not forwards .
because back in 2001 , the un agreed another set of goals , the millennium development goals .
did we hit this target ?
so can we pull off the same trick again ?
well , to answer that question , we need to benchmark where the world is today against the global goals and figure out how far we have to travel .
the lowest performing country , central african republic , scores 31 .
that 's where we are today : 61 out of 100 .
so there 's our target , 75 out of 100 .
there are costs to the environment , costs from new health problems like obesity .
so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress , and this is what our last forecast was based on .
we have countries that are underperforming on social progress , relative to their wealth .
russia has lots of natural resource wealth , but lots of social problems .
how much ? enough to get us to the global goals ?
well , let 's look at some numbers .
if we rely on economic growth alone , we 're going to get to 62.4 .
so let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress — the russia , china , indias — just up to the average .
how much social progress does that get us ?
i believe the global goals are a historic opportunity , because the world 's leaders have promised to deliver them .
and we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable , tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years .
michael green : this is a really important point ; it 's a big shift in priorities — it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty .
it 's about every country .
a cheery thought .
this is why it’s happening .
so one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
because the clock is ticking for all of us .
now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large .
if you look out your window and you can see long 's peak , you 're probably familiar with it .
now , scoop up long 's peak , and put it out in space .
the object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of mackey auditorium here .
but if it came over a city , an important city — not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis — that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization .
so , now that i 've scared the crap out of you ...
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years . they 're very rare .
i do n't even know if you can see that in the back row . these are just stars .
these things are faint .
if you 've heard about the mayan 2012 apocalypse , you 're going to hear about apophis , because you 're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway .
and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites .
and it turns out , we 've even done it .
imagine how hard that must be , and we did it .
that means we can do it again .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it 's very hard to do .
the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass .
`` if anybody here is a fan of the original `` '' star trek , '' '' they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and spock said , `` '' they 're very technically sophisticated . ''
biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses , and take advice from them , design advice .
imagine designing spring .
imagine that orchestration .
we 're not the first ones to process cellulose .
but in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years .
what i 'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they 're learning .
and it 's not because it goes fast .
co2 as a building block .
and then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity .
they actually export water molecules through .
and it finds many many ways to put many functions into it .
nature is nano .
they 're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps .
these organisms , how are they insulating against their own electric charge ?
here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
`` the question i would ask is , `` '' what 's worth solving ? '' '' if you have n't seen this , it 's pretty amazing . ''
thank you very much .
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
and it 's pretty simple .
i can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops — we all have bodies .
so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing .
( laughter ) it 's fairly self-explanatory .
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .
( laughter ) and so jumping off of that , thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world , i have this ongoing project called botanicalls — which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols .
and so i actually live in canada now , so i 've been visiting one of my local glaciers .
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .
these are initial musings for this project .
so it 's very easy , comparatively speaking , to be resilient .
so many people left what they were doing .
`` people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , `` '' ah , this is n't real . '' '' but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it 's not real . ''
these are community affairs , by the way .
bride # 2 : then why does she have my invitation ?
announcer : could be a really big deal to you . husband # 1 : is that your wife ?
husband # 2 : not for another 15 minutes . announcer : after all , it 's your special day .
`` they 've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip , risked life , health and property , spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them . '' '' and that was , of course , the very common story . ''
it 's an incredible means of coordinating , in a very fine-grained way , information flows .
this is the first vacuum cleaner , the 1905 skinner vacuum , from the hoover company . and this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car .
so you know , when you were done with it , you unscrewed it .
first of all , this got installed upside down . this light socket — ( laughter ) and so the cord keeps falling out , so i taped it in . ( laughter )
( laughter ) it 's a total , total mess .
that 's where we are . we do n't get our hair caught in it , but that 's the level of primitiveness of where we are .
we 're very , very early . thank you very much .
and i think , actually , that 's already really happening .
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
it 's how you remix . you take existing songs , you chop them up , you transform the pieces , you combine them back together again , and you 've got a new song , but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs .
`` all right , this first song you 're going to hear is `` '' nottamun town . '' '' it 's a traditional folk tune . ''
`` after that , you 'll hear dylan 's `` '' masters of war . '' '' jean ritchie : ♫ in nottamun town , not a soul would look out , ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up , not a soul would look down . ♫ bob dylan : ♫ come you masters of war , ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns , you that build the death planes , ♫ ♫ you that build all the bombs . ♫ kirby ferguson : okay , so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure . this next one is `` '' the patriot game , '' '' by dominic behan . alongside that , you 're going to hear `` '' with god on our side , '' '' by dylan . ''
`` dominic behan : ♫ come all ye young rebels , ♫ ♫ and list while i sing , ♫ ♫ for the love of one 's land is a terrible thing . ♫ bd : ♫ oh my name it is nothin ' , ♫ ♫ my age it means less , ♫ ♫ the country i come from is called the midwest . ♫ kf : okay , so in this case , dylan admits he must have heard `` '' the patriot game , '' '' he forgot about it , then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain , he just thought it was his song . ''
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
`` progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . '' '' 2007. the iphone makes it debut . ''
so it 's not multi-touch as a whole that 's patented .
it 's the small parts of it that are , and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent : to promote the progress of useful arts .
here is the first ever slide-to-unlock .
what if they had patented pop-up menus , scrollbars , the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper ?
sj : i mean , picasso had a saying .
is this promoting the progress of useful arts ?
`` `` '' i jump 'em from other writers but i arrange 'em my own way . '' '' i think this is mostly what we do . ''
we are not self-made . we are dependent on one another , and admitting this to ourselves is n't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness .
so , it can balance on a point .
and the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you 'd want to hold on to , and that would glide easily through your hands .
and then there was a second level to this object , which is that it — i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in , which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other .
except there is a slight tether here , which keeps it from going over the top of its field .
this is a little stone ball , floating .
as you can see the little tether , that it 's also magnetically levitated .
and so this is the size of the sun .
it 's made up of 16 concentric shells . each one has 92 spheres .
it turns once per day in synchrony with the earth .
( laughter ) this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
so it 's a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
and i had a lot of — always interested in the concept of a crystal ball .
i had thought about , a long time ago , in the late '60s — when i was just starting out , i was under the influence of thinking about buckminster fuller 's grand project for an electric globe across from the united nations — and other things that were happening , the space program at that time , and whole earth catalog , things like that .
the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
it can generate about a million kilowatts , in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight .
it really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting .
( applause )
then you 're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement .
`` he went with his friends in front of every russian embassy in europe and stood there with the photos to say , `` '' we have rights . '' '' they used inside out as a platform for protest . ''
and i want to thank her today .
and he 's here also today .
each time i get a wall in new york , i use his photos to continue spreading the project .
it was amazing .
while in iran at the same time abololo — of course a nickname — has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government .
twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools .
education is so essential .
here they even got the help of the firemen .
of course we wanted to go back to israel and palestine .
on the other side , people were wrapping up streets , buildings .
can art change people 's lives ?
from what i 've seen this year , yes .
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it 's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
the chromosome that was in the cell does n't have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
now i 've argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
you know , we do n't know necessarily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
i was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , i saw the brake lights go on .
i slammed on the brakes .
take your eyes off the road . that 's right .
we can only watch so much .
how can you predict the future ? that 's really hard .
actually , no . with cars , it 's not impossible .
so how do we get there ?
professor bob wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine , even in light traffic , when cars just share gps data , and we 've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots : stereo cameras , gps , and the two-dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems .
that guy could be a problem .
if one guy has a really great car , but they 're on their phone or , you know , doing something , they 're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
my search is always to find ways to chronicle , to share and to document stories about people , just everyday people .
ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says , the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
then suddenly i see it , and usually , it 's never good .
she came out to california , to los angeles , to visit me , and we went to malibu , which she thought was very disappointing .
did you know , that before the genocide in rwanda , the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one ?
anyway , a goat 's eyes are like a child 's eyes .
it did n't seem like a lot , for this guy who 'd seen so much , and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience , still found it in himself to try to protect me .
`` and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said , `` it 's all right daphne , i 'm scottish . '' ( laughter ) ''
it does n't require a tremendous thing .
i imagine an old man crying here , out of the sight of the overseer .
he pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be , if he were whole .
this strange-looking plant is called the llareta .
so i 'm not sure if there are any in this photo , but i do know the fungus is down there .
this is at about 60 feet or 18 meters , depth .
it also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
( laughter ) this is a clonal tree as well .
you 'll notice that it 's bearing cones down the center .
this is what i think is the most poetic of the oldest living things .
back in the u.s. , there 's a couple plants of similar age .
and what that means is that it 's not dormant — it 's actually been living and growing for half a million years .
the crispr technology allows scientists to make changes to the dna in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease .
and these integrated bits of viral dna get inserted at a site called crispr .
( laughter ) a big mouthful — you can see why we use the acronym crispr .
it makes a very precise break .
jennifer doudna : my colleagues were actually , i think , delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly .
jd : well , i hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly .
speaking for myself , it 's a little bit uncomfortable to do that .
( applause )
and he never expected this .
and this is a one-pound baby .
before we get started in this presentation , i just want to take care of a few housekeeping points .
if we just had european paintings , if we just had modern art , i think it gets a bit boring .
trust me , it 's very exciting .
but this is not the purpose of my talk today .
it is also one of the oldest objects on our platform .
what might that look like ?
you can look at it from the perspective of our planet , and try to see how it might look without borders , if we just organized art and culture .
so you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself .
( laughter ) just moving on , let 's take the world-famous vincent van gogh , who is very well-represented on this platform .
what we ended up with is this very interesting map , these clusters that have no reference point information , but has just used visuals to cluster things together .
each cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery .
`` all they ask me is , `` '' when can we go see this ? '' '' and by the way , if we 're nice , maybe , cyril , you can smile and find a happy one ? ''
we show you clusters , visual clusters , but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters ?
`` if we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under `` '' happiness , '' '' you would expect happiness , i guess . ''
we call it propaganda gardening . ( laughter ) corner row railway , station car park , front of a health center , people 's front gardens , and even in front of the police station . ( laughter ) we 've got edible canal towpaths , and we 've got sprouting cemeteries .
i have never , ever experienced anything like that in my life .
`` we went to the doctors . we 've just had a 6-million-pound health center built in todmorden , and for some reason that i can not comprehend , it has been surrounded by prickly plants . ( laughter ) so we went to the doctors , said , `` '' would you mind us taking them up ? '' '' they said , `` '' absolutely fine , provided you get planning permission and you do it in latin and you do it in triplicate , '' '' so we did — ( laughter ) — and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor 's surgery . ''
and there 's been lots of other examples , like the corn that was in front of the police station , and the old people 's home that we 've planted it with food that they can pick and grow .
`` and because we were doing that , some local academics said , `` '' you know , we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you . ''
it 's been really quite a roller coaster experience , but going back to that first question that we asked , is it replicable ? yeah . it most certainly is replicable .
first , they 're going to create an asset register of spare land that they 've got , put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live , and they 're going to underpin that with a license .
suddenly , we 're seeing actions on the ground from local government . we 're seeing this mainstreamed .
we are in our best suits .
`` and i look at her , and i say , `` '' now , do n't you think we need more than one black person in the u.s . senate ? '' '' now harold and i — ( applause ) — we still laugh about that story , and in many ways , the moment caught me off guard , but deep , deep down inside , i actually was n't surprised . ''
and i was n't surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before .
then i realized , the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it , and the first step to any form of action is awareness .
but i work in the investment business , and we have a saying : the numbers do not lie .
of the fortune 250 , there are only seven ceos that are minorities , and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today , thousands , only two are chaired by black women , and you 're looking at one of them , the same one who , not too long ago , was nearly mistaken for kitchen help .
but if i walked you into a fortune 500 company , and everyone around the table is a white male , when will it be that we think that 's weird too ?
there was a corporate study that said that , instead of avoiding race , the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on .
they actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races , including the majority one .
so i think it 's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race : black , white , asian , hispanic , male , female , all of us , if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in america , i think we have to have real conversations about this issue .
he demanded that every open position have a diverse slate of candidates .
we take a stand . we show courage .
i 'm asking you not to be color blind , but to be color brave , so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible .
my story is not unique .
with the help of the family , they cross oceans , they cross deserts , they cross rivers , they cross mountains .
true , people send 200 dollars per month , on average . but , repeated month after month , by millions of people , these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency .
no wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people .
they actually act like an insurance .
and yet , this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid , while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy , through regulations .
and in my mind , i could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance .
it is not only men .
remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most .
my wife is a venezuelan .
my children are americans .
i want to be in india and in the u.s. at the same time .
as a product designer , it 's my job to see those everyday things , to feel them , and try to improve upon them .
that sticker was n't there when i was a kid .
and dig at it with our nails , damaging the flesh .
but something interesting happened .
`` i simply picked up the piece of fruit , dug at it with my nails , tried to flick it off , and then wondered , `` was there another sticker ? '' ''
why do we get used to everyday things ?
as the weeks went by , driving became easier and easier .
but it 's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees .
i had to work at it .
during my years at apple , steve jobs challenged us to come into work every day , to see our products through the eyes of the customer , the new customer , the one that has fears and possible frustrations and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them .
see , back in the '90s , being a gadget freak like i am , i would rush out to the store for the very , very latest gadget .
i 'd take all the time to get to the store , i 'd check out , i 'd come back home , i 'd start to unbox it .
i ca n't believe it !
what did we do instead ?
you see , there are invisible problems all around us , ones we can solve .
but first we need to see them , to feel them .
in the 1900s when they first came out , they were really simple to use .
now that seemed great .
so what did we do ?
there are many different screws : wood screws , metal screws , anchors , concrete screws , the list went on and on .
`` because there 's so many different wall types . '' '' so we thought about it , we optimized it , and we came up with three different screws to put in the box . ''
so what did we do ?
`` so if we focus on those tiny details , the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say , `` '' are those important or is that the way we 've always done it ? ''
`` my son came to me the other day and i asked him , `` go run out to the mailbox and check it . '' ''
and what you 're looking at is columns of dust where there 's so much dust — by the way , the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles — and what 's happening is there 's so much dust , it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction .
we 've upgraded time and again and again .
and it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades .
we found another one last month .
and as you 're thinking about this , we 're continuing to mutate .
and by the way , this is not a debate that we 're ready for , because we have really misused the science in this .
in fact , it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings .
why would that matter ?
because in essence what it means is you can take a cell , which is a pluripotent stem cell , which is like a skier at the top of a mountain , and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells , four , eight , 16 , and then it gets so crowded after 16 divisions that those cells have to differentiate .
and this is only one of the conditions that 's out there .
so this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures .
the third , is this too much information ?
these three tough little buggers are , on the left , my grandmother , age five , and then her sister and brother , ages 11 and nine .
the new york city that i encountered felt pretty built up .
i just did n't really know how .
now , the site itself is located at the very heart of the lower east side , and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city .
here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse .
so what we 're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
i take it quite seriously , but i 'm here to talk about something that 's become very important to me in the last year or two .
and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives , but whether , if we could see the earth a century from now , we 'd recognize it .
it 's a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desks is n't going to help .
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation , air and water pollution , water shortages and loss of biodiversity .
not bad .
yet they do that .
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness .
so-called low-fat diets , so-called low-carb diets — these are not solutions .
it was like your romantic vision of europe .
vitamins had not been invented .
the cornflake had n't been invented .
thus arrived convenience .
it was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework .
and chicken soon joined them on the throne .
not that they were any good , but they were there .
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
we tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
many people became fat-phobic .
but mostly they did n't eat broccoli .
by the '70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets — and we all have our favorites , actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
leading the way — what 's leading the way ?
and as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets .
now here is where we all meet .
even though we 've come to this from different points , we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food .
wo n't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless , sissy , liberals ?
it would seem absurd , but that 's exactly what should happen , and what progressive people , forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating , along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants .
i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously — one might say indiscriminately — for about 30 years .
it was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen .
it was here i learned how we actually execute those films .
as light travels deeper into the water , we lose the red wavelengths , then the green wavelengths , leaving us with blue at the far depths .
these are the ribbons of light , like you might see on the bottom of a pool , that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean 's surface .
because in the end , we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world , we 're trying to create a believable world , one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story .
( laughter ) his binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has .
you can see here , sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes — usually eve .
( video ) wall-e : eva ?
danielle feinberg : there 's a beauty in these unexpected moments — when you find the key to unlocking a robot 's soul , the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life .
`` ♫ but love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ by daybreak she 's gone ♫ ♫ over the frozen river , home ♫ ♫ me and johnny walker ♫ ♫ see in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ billie , time , ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says , ♫ ♫ `` '' this time it 's love '' '' ♫ ( applause ) ''
yves uses his body to steer the wing .
we sign with a major label .
i would be shocked if you had n't .
should we edit a human embryo ?
there are two major repair pathways .
it 's an ok way to maybe , like , knock out a gene , but it 's not the way that we really want to do genome editing .
the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting .
yeah , it is cheap in comparison .
it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars , and it cuts the time a lot , too .
that 's great .
they 're still kind of black boxes .
and this is a line of research that people are going to do .
that makes us all the inventors of crispr , and i would say that makes us all the shepherds of crispr .
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .
she 's looking at the seams . she 's looking at the construction .
but to a fashionista , what it really is is a sign of prada 's genius : that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that does n't need to be changed by one iota , and to be current and to be now .
they 're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist .
i 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through .
some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear , but if you talk to any designer at any level , including these high-end designers , they always say their main inspiration comes from the street : where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks .
`` we invited tom ford to come — the conference was called , `` '' ready to share : fashion and the ownership of creativity '' '' — and we asked him exactly this question . ''
and this is a good thing . we need lots of options .
okay , we 'll move on . ( laughter ) this is not unlike the world of comedy .
i do n't know if you know that jokes also ca n't be copyright protected .
they knock themselves off .
they make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic : the santee alley demographic .
in the european union , they went in the other direction .
so , that does not stop the knock-off artists .
there 's a bunch of other industries that do n't have copyright protection , including the food industry .
it does n't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look , you can not copyright the sculptural design .
fireworks displays , the rules of games , the smell of perfume : no .
and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you , but these are the gross sales for low i.p . industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there 's the gross sales of films and books .
( applause ) it ai n't pretty . ( applause )
nowadays , we do n't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold .
he 's smart , he 's smart .
when i reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , i feel young , invincible , eternal .
so on one of these rides , i talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden .
i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties — not because they were physically unfit .
and i became increasingly more and more agitated , because i was there not only to be with them , but also to ride and create a team and i did n't know what to do .
i 'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
i tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere .
`` so i would say , `` '' alex , i know that it 's terribly difficult . ''
and he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only , the slums and the state prison , where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there .
now , i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology .
it literally propels you upwards .
it 's very cold , and you 're standing in one of these rainy days , and it 's drizzling and cold and chilly , and you 're standing in , let 's say , yokneam .
that 's where joshua descended and crossed the jordan and led the people of israel into the land of canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from africa .
i ride with these kids once a week , every tuesday .
it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay .
( applause ) so we decided , a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this was n't sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values , and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance .
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
so what do you get ? you get better decision-making , and you get less herd behavior , and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results .
for me it was the start of a long journey , but i decided that day to matter .
thank you .
usually at the end of our shift we had a drink — but not that night .
we cared about god , the less fortunate , and the ocean .
and then i did .
but for the last few decades , the dialogue around abortion in the united states has left little room for anything beyond pro-life and pro-choice .
but as much as abortion is hotly debated , it 's still rare for us , whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people , to talk with one another about the abortions that we have .
there are so many important issues that we ca n't talk about .
there are two main ways to get started .
it also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends .
they have a terminal illness , their mother just died , they have a child with special needs and they ca n't talk about it .
listening and storytelling .
sounds maybe , easy ? we could all do that .
i wish i could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you , or that there 's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed .
there 's never a time when everyone will be on the same page , share the same lens , or know the same history .
`` `` what was that like ? '' ''
over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth . saying the word god did not turn this volunteer into a christian , but it did make her a much better listener of christian women . so , another way to be pro-voice is to share stories , and one risk that you take on , when you share your story with someone else , is that given the same set of circumstances as you
and it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another .
stigma , shame , prejudice , discrimination , oppression .
it was a welcome , yet dramatic departure from what i experience when i talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion .
pickles ?
( laughter ) and i think this is supposed to be a snail .
something about this bothered me .
just as i was about to start my final exams , i decided to take a break from an all-nighter and go to a lecture by dr. paul farmer , a leading health activist for the global poor .
i was there to design and build a new type of hospital with dr. farmer and his team .
simple , site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals .
designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
we worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them into the walls of the hospital .
in each of these projects , we asked a simple question : what more can architecture do ?
countries like germany and south africa and , of course , rwanda , have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past , in order to heal their national psyche .
the memorial will take us on a journey through a classical , almost familiar building type , like the parthenon or the colonnade at the vatican .
when we think about how it should be built , we were reminded of ubudehe , the building process we learned about in rwanda .
there are about a hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy .
in the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter .
if you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up .
the air in this room is very smooth .
at early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big — literally — at early times .
you 've heard of entropy .
if you have the air in this room , you do n't notice each individual atom .
the fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that 's because entropy is increasing .
50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures .
it 's not true that we 've figured it out by now .
we learned that it 's accelerating .
if you look at the galaxy , it 's moving away .
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
there 's a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
the curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates .
the energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
he says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we ca n't live there .
that will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie .
if our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it .
they will fall into black holes .
number one : if the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the big bang ?
why are n't we in empty space ?
`` you might say , `` '' well there 's nothing there to be living , '' '' but that 's not right . ''
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
why are n't you ?
so like i said , i do n't actually know the answer .
so the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
thank you .
it 's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events .
that 's 75 percent .
now i 'm a scientist , i do experiments .
but the question is , is it good for us ?
it acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and anxiety are reduced .
as an neuroscientist , this was especially confusing , because according to all the theories out there , when your expectations are not met , you should alter them .
and indeed they did — but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected .
and it 's not that they did n't remember the numbers that we gave them ; everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about 30 percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent .
what this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact .
my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget .
`` `` '' the sleepy giant , '' '' which is the song that i just sang , is one of his poems . ''
`` when she was 10 years old in 1927 , she published her first book of poems called `` '' the janitor 's boy . '' '' here she is . ''
and here 's her poem .
`` ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ i 'm going to sail away ♫ ♫ gone to sheepshead bay ♫ ♫ with my janitor 's red-haired boy . ♫ ♫ on an old settee ♫ ♫ my red-haired boy and me ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy . ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ the janitor 's red-haired boy ♫ ( applause ) the next poem is by e.e . cummings , `` maggie and milly and molly and may . '' ''
i became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them , and started to research their lives , and then decided to write a book about it .
he converted from his anglican faith .
`` it is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . '' '' and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the plain-song music 130 years after he 'd written the letter . ''
♫ they 're all the same . ♫ ♫ nor mouth had nor no mind expressed ♫ ♫ what heart heard of , ghost had guessed : ♫ ♫ it 's the blight man was born for , ♫ ♫ it is margaret that you mourn for ♫ thank you so much .
ok , most of you .
very brave of you , because the first one was written by the human poet william blake .
according to the logic of the turing test , can a computer write poetry ?
let 's play our third and final test .
it simply means that the category of the human is unstable .
can we build an intelligent computer ?
can we build a creative computer ?
in fact , gayla 's uncle is still alive to this day , and learning how to waltz .
and as she did , other ones came to mind .
the town had a vermiculite mine in it .
vermiculite was used for soil conditioners , to make plants grow faster and better .
so now she had an ally .
`` they said things like , `` '' well , if it were really dangerous , someone would have told us . '' '' `` `` if that 's really why everyone was dying , the doctors would have told us . '' '' some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said , `` '' i do n't want to be a victim . ''
you could see willful blindness in the run-up to the iraq war .
but what i 've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is , actually , they 're very loyal and quite often very conservative people .
`` ignorance is bliss , they say , but you ca n't put up with things like this . '' '' i talked to steve bolsin , a british doctor , who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies . ''
these are people of immense persistence , incredible patience , and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent .
i took my 12-year-old daughter with me , because i really wanted her to meet gayla .
`` she had freedom , and she was ready to use it . '' '' thank you very much . ''
and i 'm at a stage in life where i 'm yearning for my old days , so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid , indeed , i was a conservative .
okay , see ? it 's done . it 's almost done . here we go .
that 's it . please save this .
i do n't want to get into that , you know ; that 's not my point .
they go to church , by which i mean , they do lots of things for free for each other .
they serve food to poor people .
they want to regulate us , those conservatives , to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
so here 's exhibit number one .
`` i want to share with you my latest hero , julian sanchez , a libertarian who works at the , for many people , `` '' evil '' '' cato institute . ''
he 's a terrible producer of videos , but it 's great content , so i 'm going to give you a little bit of it .
larry lessig : so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos .
ll : or ...
and it 's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end , it 's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other .
all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression .
it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art .
if we 're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one , i think we risk suppressing this different and richer and , in some ways , maybe even more important one .
all of the great disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them , or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them , to celebrate this add-on remix creativity .
wildly different .
the creator is a sharecropper in this story .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
and for that sharing activity to happen , we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use .
now that picture of an ecology of creativity , the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity , is that the ecology of creativity we have right now ?
i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious wmg that matched their content id .
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .
my whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video , a video about fair use , that included warner music group music .
i went to this site , and i had to answer these questions .
it is outrageous .
and the claims of having life beyond earth need to be definitive , they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it .
and is that life still there ?
we do n't know that .
but a few years ago we started to look at a number of craters .
a few months ago the fairy tale came true .
liquid water is flowing down these craters .
it has weeping water right now .
liquid water on its surface .
where does the silica come from ?
another moon , very similar , is europa .
these moons are fabulous moons .
titan is a huge moon of saturn .
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
and this area is not liquid water ; it 's methane .
and what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would ?
and electronic tattoos also shout .
and as you 're thinking of the consequences of that , it 's getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it 's not just the electronic tattoos , it 's facial recognition that 's getting really good .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes . ( laughter ) but that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
remember ? he did a horrible thing , condemned for all time to roll this rock up , it would roll back down , roll back up , roll back down .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
she kept getting distracted . he eventually won the race .
just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message .
and then , of course , there 's narcissus .
nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus .
what that means is that it 's time to move to a new level of economic value .
what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person — that 's exactly what they need at this moment in time ?
they say , you americans .
so , as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings , then every experience we have is authentic .
there 's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods .
and they realize , i 'm right !
with the service economy , it is about improving quality .
so , how do you render authenticity , is the question .
and it doth follow , as night the day , that thou canst not then be false to any man .
there are two dimensions to authenticity : one , being true to yourself , which is very self-directed .
where , on one dimension it 's a matter of being true to yourself .
fact is , there 's a general rule : if you do n't like it , it 's fake ; if you do like it , it 's faux .
( laughter ) but it is — oh , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to — ( laughter ) — sorry .
we wo n't talk about santa claus then .
when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment .
right , the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business .
knowing where your heritage is : what you have done in the past .
think about disney again .
right , the t & a network . then it bought miramax , known for its nc-17 fare , and all of a sudden , families everywhere could n't really trust what they were getting from disney .
because it is no longer true to itself .
when it comes to being what you say you are , the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not .
think about any hotel , any airline , any hospital .
then you have that perception that you are phony .
that 's why you have companies like starbucks , right , that does n't advertise at all .
and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience .
you know how much coffee is worth , when treated as a commodity as a bean ?
`` well , as alexander graham bell famously said on his first successful telephone call , `` hello , is that domino 's pizza ? '' ''
`` and he should have said , `` what a strange , long trip it 's about to become . '' ''
my lower half is appearing at a different conference ( laughter ) in a different country .
but still , i 'm sorry i ca n't be with you in person .
but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players .
the revolution — this revolution — is much bigger than that .
we lived in ethiopia for a month , working at an orphanage .
big skies , big hearts , big , shining continent .
the right to live like a human .
this is about justice . really .
this is not about charity . this is about justice .
we 're standing around with watering cans , when what we really need is the fire brigade .
it 's crazy , really , when you think about it .
catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert .
our values : do we have any ?
but equality for africa — that 's a big , expensive idea .
they 've done incredible stuff , unbelievable stuff .
( laughter ) but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for .
economists confirm it , and they know much more than i do .
so why , then , are we not pumping our fists into the air ?
probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we 've got to do something about it .
but idealism allied with pragmatism , with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth .
lurching a little , but it 's building .
so this is what i hope that you will do , if i could be so bold , and not have it deducted from my number of wishes .
and you , at this conference , are in a unique position .
a lot of people are getting together , and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier , the one campaign .
i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day .
that 's one billion media hits .
this has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
it 's actually where it all started for me .
except , i 've never lived one day of my life there .
and for more and more of us , home has really less to do with a piece of soil than , you could say , with a piece of soul .
`` if somebody suddenly asks me , `` '' where 's your home ? '' '' i think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever i happen to be . ''
and when i woke up the next morning , i was sleeping on a friend 's floor , the only thing i had in the world was a toothbrush i had just bought from an all-night supermarket .
already , we represent the fifth-largest nation on earth .
but for the fortunate among us , i think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities .
they move to new york city .
`` `` '' well — '' '' here my friend hemmed and hawed — `` well , actually it 's a catholic hermitage . '' ''
it was really all the freedom i know when i 'm traveling , but it also profoundly felt like coming home .
movement is a fantastic privilege , and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing .
and home , in the end , is of course not just the place where you sleep .
( applause )
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
and we also use three laser range finders .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called airpix .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
so basically that 's how it works .
( music ) ( video ) announcer : this is an historic day in january .
well this is what it 's all about , this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity .
he 's approaching the end of the run , makes his way between the barrels that are set up there .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
`` you must be out of your mind . '' '' but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle , and it 's not going to be on the road until it 's proven as safe as , or safer than , today 's vehicle . ''
so today , the things i 've showed you today , is just the beginning .
and so , how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .
i mean , these sort of top-down , mono-functional , capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
so our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept , harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern .
here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
basically , new york was built on the backs of oystermen , and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .
how does the reef work ? well , it 's very , very simple .
a core concept here is that climate change is n't something that — the answers wo n't land down from the moon .
new word .
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
i have n't had a good look . well , it 's not that great a convenience .
ignore the instructions , that 's what the government has to put in there to confuse you , i 'm sure .
`` but these people , they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead — `` '' hi , there '' '' — but they can hear the dead as well , and they can relay this information back to the living . ''
now , i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so .
`` good bye . '' '' and she did n't answer the damn question ! ''
and what does he do ? he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased , the people he 's talking to through his ear , you see ?
now , it may bring a certain amount of comfort , but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .
they do n't get any information , they do n't get any value for what they spend .
`` we call her `` '' the talons . '' '' sylvia browne — thank you — sylvia browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment . ''
he 's well educated , he 's smart , he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he does n't give a damn .
now , without that , how could we possibly function ? ( laughter ) she gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
and we have n't heard from her since . strange .
she said that , first of all , that she did n't know how to contact me .
all the more reason to take the million dollars , would n't you think , sylvia ?
they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
`` it says right on the back here , `` '' in case of overdose , contact your poison control center immediately , '' '' and it gives an 800 number . ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) the answer may surprise you .
now wait a minute , we heard about a guy in florida .
now , let me tell you , the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big carrot , but i must say , the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer does n't mean that the powers do n't exist .
well , with sylvia browne i would think so .
you know , 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone — that 's more than lawyers make !
i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money .
those are very important , critically important to us .
we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it .
she did accept and then backed away .
thank you .
so i 'm thinking , you know , this procedure has n't changed in about 40 years .
so why should you care ? bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells .
and ultimately — and here 's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors , who come together for a reunion each year at stanford .
thank you very much .
i mean , huck , of course , was tremendous .
'anybody up on that raft with you ? ' huck says , 'yeah . ' 'is he black or white ? ' 'white . ' and they go off .
`` huh . you know , i do n't know if you could use this or not , but i was quoting wright morris , a writer from nebraska , who says , 'we 're more and more into communications and less and less into communication . ' okay , kids , i got to scram , got to go see my cardiologist . '' '' and that 's studs terkel . ''
( applause ) so , talk about risk taking . i 'm going to do somebody that nobody likes .
and i 'm doing her because i think we think of risk , at a conference like this , as a good thing .
and he beat me too . but that did n't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family ; it was a nightmare .
and then he put her in the hallway .
all around her head was just swollen ; her head was about two sizes of its own size .
he said , he said , he said , 'we ca n't , we ca n't let nobody find out about this . ' he say , 'you 've got to help me . ' i agree . i agree .
we told a security guard that she was missing , though she was n't missing .
`` ( applause ) when i started this project called `` '' on the road : a search for an american character '' '' with my tape recorder , i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects — bull riders , cowboys , pig farmers , drum majorettes — but i sort of got tripped on race relations , because my first big show was a show about a race riot . ''
everybody thought the four cops would go to jail .
they did not , so there were riots .
they have a lot of respect , as i do , for dr. martin king .
but after the riot , it 's too much difference .
and i 've been going to the rodeos with him , and we 've bonded .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' and , i mean , funny things like this happen . ''
i mean , i guess it just be like — i guess it be like the day my brother died .
( applause )
look into your own heart , discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse , under any circumstance whatsoever , to inflict that pain on anybody else .
because with a few wonderful exceptions , very often when religious people come together , religious leaders come together , they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort .
if we do n't manage to implement the golden rule globally , so that we treat all peoples , wherever and whoever they may be , as though they were as important as ourselves , i doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation .
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
in malaysia , there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people , young people , and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art .
but of course you do n't understand compassion if you 're just going to think about it .
because that is what is so wonderful about ted .
and i am convinced .
i felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at vevey , that when people of all different persuasions come together , working side by side for a common goal , differences melt away .
you plan on coming back , getting undressed , going to bed , waking up , doing it again , and that anticipation , that rhythm , helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives , and gives it a measure of predictability .
and i get on the car , and i look , and i notice this couple , college-aged , student-looking kids , a guy and a girl , and they 're sitting next to each other , and she 's got her leg draped over his knee , and they 're doing — they have this little contraption , and they 're tying these knots , and they 're doing it with one hand , they 're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly , and then she 'll hand the thing to him and he 'll do it .
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he 's the guy giving the lecture .
it was that enveloping , and there was only one spot that did n't hurt worse than anything i 'd ever felt , and it was my instep , and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb .
later on , when i got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time , i went back to him and i was sort of asking him , you know , what am i gon na do ?
it 's like i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about not finding parking .
i step off , i 'm standing on the platform , and i feel my index finger in the first scar that i ever got , from my umbilical cord , and then around that , is traced the last scar that i got from my surgeon , and i think that , that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team , and their training and their skill and , always , a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos .
this is tim ferriss circa 1979 a.d. age two .
my left lung had collapsed when i was born .
and i went wild eyed and thought i was going to die .
more specifically , i want you to feel like you 're capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer , a world-class language learner , and a tango champion .
first principles , this is very important .
`` and then chris sacca , who is now a dear friend mine , had completed an iron man with 103 degree temperature , said , `` '' i have the answer to your prayers . '' '' and he introduced me to the work of a man named terry laughlin who is the founder of total immersion swimming . ''
so here are the new rules of swimming , if any of you are afraid of swimming , or not good at it .
so what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body , much like a small car behind a big car on the highway .
the body is denser than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , submerged naturally .
so you do n't kick . but you do use a small flick .
you can see this is the left extension .
and the entry point for his right hand — notice this , he 's not reaching in front and catching the water .
rather , he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm , and then propelling himself by streamlining — very important .
i 'll be doing a swimming lesson later , for myself , if anyone wants to join me .
languages . material versus method .
then i transferred to a different school sophomore year , and i had a choice of other languages . most of my friends were taking japanese .
you 'll have japanese language classes every day to help you cope .
i could n't believe i was on the other side of the world .
i walked in to school .
i could n't read any of it — hieroglyphics , it could have been — because it was kanji , chinese characters adapted into the japanese language .
( laughter ) and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method .
we can talk about that if anyone in interested .
( laughter ) and proceeded to look at — i wanted to set competition so i 'd have a deadline — parkinson 's law , the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it .
i got a female instructor first , to teach me the female role , the follow , because i wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop , so i would n't have a repeat of college .
these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who 'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years .
one of the most elegant dancers of his generation , known for his long steps , and his tempo changes and his pivots .
alicia , in her own right , very famous .
so i think you 'll agree , they look quite good together .
he did n't lead with his chest , which requires you lean forward .
so fear is your friend . fear is an indicator .
i 'd like to talk about my dad .
now he 's really pretty sick . he needs help eating , he needs help getting dressed , he does n't really know where he is or when it is , and it 's been really , really hard .
you ca n't sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you do n't know who they are .
he was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like .
my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's , and he 's kind and loving now .
i was never as kind as my dad , and i was never as loving .
i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia , it will survive .
i do n't want to get alzheimer 's disease .
build creative clusters in cities ; create more r & d parks , so on and so forth .
the ideas are coming back from the consumers , and they 're often ahead of the producers .
when the mobile telephone companies invented sms , they had no idea what it was for ; it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use .
we like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation : there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea .
you 're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder .
`` best example : who in the music industry , 30 years ago , would have said , `` '' yes , let 's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to . ''
and across a whole range of fields — from software , astronomy , natural sciences , vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing , so on and so forth — you find people who want to do things because they love it , but they want to do these things to very high standards .
they take their leisure very seriously : they acquire skills ; they invest time ; they use technology that 's getting cheaper — it 's not just the internet : cameras , design technology , leisure technology , surfboards , so on and so forth .
the users can be producers .
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
this is new ; this is traditional .
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding , because they 're threatened by them .
`` i 've invented this brilliant new program that is much , much better than microsoft outlook . '' '' which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft , with microsoft outlook ? no one . ''
so , there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open-source and consumer-driven innovation , because it 's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly .
those were the two places .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
did n't go into the internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
how many people does he employ to service that population ?
every morning , there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters . ( laughter ) so this is about companies built on communities , that provide communities with tools , resources , platforms in which they can share .
so here is one of the challenges , i think , for people like me , who do a lot of work with government .
they 've never found a society that did not have it .
`` and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , `` '' fix a plate '' '' for that person , put it in the oven , then we could say grace , and we could eat . ''
they would offer sweets or money .
`` mom says , `` '' if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , 'nothing . ' and if they insist , say , 'whatever you mind to give me . ' '' '' this was the nature of being at that table . ''
`` in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , `` '' even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . '' '' so , at the table at 915 , i learned something about compassion . ''
it was christmas , and at our family , oh , what a morning .
in fact , you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing , and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed , except that daddy messed it up .
and daddy brought elder revels to the christmas family celebration .
i see — always , it stirs my heart — a picture of dr. martin luther king , jr .
`` he insisted , `` '' i must go . '' '' so , sitting on a flatbed truck , the elders of the community are there , and bobby stands up and says to the people , `` '' i have bad news for you . ''
how do you make it real ?
i believe that whatever we did around that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity .
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god 's citizens , all god 's children , remembering mama eternal .
and i must say , i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages , because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up .
`` and some of you might be standing here thinking , saying , `` '' ok , you know , ory , you 're harvard-educated , and all you privileged people come here , saying , 'forget the poor people . ''
so they took me to a private , catholic , elementary school , which set the foundation for what ended up being my career .
they talk about corruption .
my dream school at that time was kenya high school , a national school .
and , you know , you must be joking if you think you can get a slot .
`` and we left , and i swore to myself , and i was like , `` '' i 'm never , ever going to have to beg for anything in my life . '' '' they called me two weeks later , they 're like , oh , yeah , you can come now . and i told them to stuff it . ''
he never told anyone that he had aids , his fear of the stigma was so strong .
and so i went on to google , cryptococcal meningitis , you know .
because of doctor-patient privilege , they could n't really tell us what was going on .
you know , so money ran out .
he got sick again .
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
this is the damage it causes .
because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ?
when you focus just on the disasters — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — we 're ignoring the potential .
why are we not generating our own content ?
and i ca n't emphasize that enough , you know .
i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa .
everything else on there is a labor of love .
so we need new policies , we need — where 's that coming from , you know ?
and i 'd ask all of you , when you leave here , please just share , and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going , because it can make a difference .
practically . i mean , when i was a first-year student in law school , my mom 's business had collapsed , so i was supporting her .
we just need a push .
and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born .
so meet al .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
but it 's doing something that no other government technology does .
and if you 're one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
`` and because government ultimately derives its power from us — remember `` '' we the people ? '' '' — how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens . ''
`` so one day — this is an actual report — this came in : `` '' opossum in my trashcan . ca n't tell if it 's dead . ''
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
now how many times have we elected a political leader — and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected — and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
do we really think we 're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
the great mathematician andré weil likened this — no kidding — to sexual pleasure .
the reward may be big .
( board shaking ) this is a bit of a sport , because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there .
computing power helps , but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data .
let 's work out a baby problem .
this algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages , in the same way as we used randomness in the galton board experiment .
each time they arrive at some site , they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one .
and again , and again , and again .
once again , the solution emerges from the randomness .
or should i say , one of the most striking nights .
it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas , which are a crowd of electrons .
actually , i had already announced by mistake that we could solve it .
that being said , it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work .
and i 've been working with my staff at institut henri poincaré , together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide , so that we can found our own , very special museum of mathematics there .
( applause )
and the closer we look at anything , the more it disappears .
in fact , if you look really closely at stuff , if you look at the basic substructure of matter , there is n't anything there .
so everything that matters , that 's important , is invisible .
it 's about an m.p . called geoffrey dickens .
( laughter ) try as he might , he could n't get away from her .
i have no idea what any of you are thinking . is n't that amazing ?
but we can touch each other , taste each other perhaps , if we get close enough .
( laughter ) the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful .
this is extraordinary . because rice — get this — rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
you ca n't see light . when it 's dark , in a vacuum , if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes , you wo n't see it . slightly technical , some physicists will disagree with this .
electricity , you ca n't see that .
but the point , what i 've got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
`` `` '' why are we here ? '' '' and `` '' what should we do about it while we are ? ''
spectacular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
they 're all on their way back underground now .
( applause )
she loved life .
and i remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music .
a deep , life-altering depression , from which she never recovered .
now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of fatigue , sleep disturbance , pain and anxiety compared with men .
and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression .
and today , i lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women .
today , we know that every cell has a sex .
from our brains to our hearts , our lungs , our joints .
and that 's when she found us .
there 's a discrete blockage or stenosis .
the plaque is laid down more evenly , more diffusely along the artery , and it 's harder to see .
so what about treatment ?
but it 's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men .
they may not be fast enough , but it has produced results .
we can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease .
but even though we know that these differences occur , 66 percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified .
so , i think we have to ask again the question : why leave women 's health to chance ?
we know that every cell has a sex .
thank you .
i 'll leave that to others .
that was our task .
we worked with the community , not telling them what was going to happen in a language they did n't understand .
i 'm going to ask you to do some more work .
in the case of the shower : does it have hot and cold water , two taps that work , a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body , and a drain that takes the water away ?
that 's our average budget .
i think there 's an obvious question that i hope you 're thinking about .
and we 'll go a lot further than that ; the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution .
we did it . he provided us dust monitors .
and over the year , trachoma dropped radically in this place , and stayed low .
and finally bishnu , the leader of the team , has now understood that not only have we built toilets , we 've also built a team , and that team is now working in two villages where they 're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding .
we 've never found that .
`` nelson mandela said , in the mid-2000s , not too far from here , he said that like slavery and apartheid , `` '' poverty is not natural . ''
thank you very much for your time .
you might say the future is small .
now when i say that , what most people hear me say is that we 're working on curing cancer .
things like vaccination , timely screening and of course , stopping smoking .
with the integrated microscope and computer analysis , rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup .
for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in , it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues .
its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine .
in fact , there 's a whole world of paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics .
i ca n't say that 's it 's a promise ; it 's a dream .
i 'm going to tell you what i hope will happen with my technology , that my team and i will put our hearts and souls into making a reality .
so the problem is soluble , and the way we should go about solving it is , say , dealing with electricity production , which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of co2 emissions .
and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation , and wind power , nuclear power and coal to co2 capture , which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment , and work .
instead , we spend our time talking .
and you need to deal — somehow break the link between human actions that change climate , and the climate change itself . and that 's particularly important because , of course , while we can adapt to climate change — and it 's important to be honest here , there will be some benefits to climate change .
i spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high arctic .
they will completely lose .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
this geo-engineering idea , in it 's simplest form , is basically the following .
but it clearly cools down .
and there are times you might like to do something quick .
another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
`` and to the person who was promoting it said , `` the atmosphere 's much more complicated . '' ''
the one new thing is this essay .
he said roughly what 's been said before .
and that got me thinking . i 've worked on this topic on and off , but not so much technically . and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night .
it was very hard to calculate from first principles . i was stumped .
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .
i 'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it .
but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this .
a debate that involves musicians , scientists , philosophers , writers , who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are .
it 's very cheap . we have a lot of leverage .
i do n't think anybody takes that seriously .
we might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy , that it 's a lot better than not geo-engineering .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
it 's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you 'd use it as a substitute for action .
i 'll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
a treaty that decides who gets to do this .
but it might well be that , in fact , if china wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable , they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this , and they may just decide they 'd really rather have a geo-engineered world than a non-geo-engineered world .
thank you very much .
and the anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation : that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they would n't have really understood it .
they were responding to immediate concerns .
the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning , noon and night .
and we are also changing our teeth right now .
but i think from the point of view of a neanderthal , there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have .
the lesson of the titanic , for a lot of the contemporaries , was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship .
in the second world war , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .
they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate , and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts .
so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight .
it means , i think , that we 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities .
and he published that book in the early 1930s , and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook .
so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters .
okay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
there is some good news . first of all , let me say , we 've come a long , long way .
here we go . ( laughter ) this little baby has a lot of horsepower .
here we 've got a little bit of long-term memory , so , you know that night you want to forget , when you got really drunk ? bye-bye ! gone . ( laughter ) so actually , it 's filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away , electrically transmitting information , zizzing , zizzing . i 'm going to give you a little side view here .
when we were ancient man — ( laughter ) — millions of years ago , and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator , okay ? — ( laughter ) — we would — thank you . i drew these myself . ( laughter ) thank you very much . thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . anyway , we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol , and then we 'd kill or be killed , we 'd eat or we 'd be eaten , and then suddenly we 'd de-fuel , and we 'd go back to normal . okay .
so the problem is , nowadays , with modern man— ( laughter ) — when we feel in danger , we still fill up with our own chemical but because we ca n't kill traffic wardens — ( laughter ) — or eat estate agents , the fuel just stays in our body over and over , so we 're in a constant state of alarm , a constant state . and here 's another thing that happened .
but if we think about it , we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet , the human species .
here it gets trickier .
we need to think of intelligence as an optimization process , a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations .
suppose we give an a.i . the goal to make humans smile .
the point is , we should not be confident that we have this under control here .
but the more of the control problem that we solve in advance , the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well .
or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach ?
that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
a break of light and air , an architectural biding of time .
as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance .
that 's the end .
where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins .
very soon , people were participating .
you see , i was born in one country and raised in the other .
and when i would go back to swaziland , i would be constantly confronted by how very non-swazi i was becoming .
when i began to read , i gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like steve biko and frantz fanon , who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness .
i read every piece of african fiction that i could get my hands on .
( laughter ) but africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors .
this is by accident , but sometimes , it 's by design .
my dream is that young africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas , is our home .
we now have a platform .
before now , if you wanted to hear from the youth in africa , you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth — ( laughter ) to wake up in the morning , take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time .
before now , if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government , you were pushed to protest , suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some western paper somewhere might make someone care .
i believe that with a social pan-africanist thinking and using the internet as a tool , we can begin to rescue each other , and ultimately , to rescue ourselves .
thank you .
`` i say , `` '' oh , no , i continue . '' '' so , i did tropical ecology and plant botany . ''
that is a forest giraffe .
i think you guys know it quite well .
here we have savanna giraffes , but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo .
every person was looking his way — where to go , we do n't know .
they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
and i was from the same area to him .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
he has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest .
and what i did , i gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis .
poaching — oh , no way .
what 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
`` but they said , `` '' you guys , you think that soldiers who are dying are not important , and your animals you are protecting are most important . ''
we do n't think so .
sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with jean-pierre bemba , with mbusa nyamwisi , with kabila , and i 'm there .
i had only this equipment — my satellite phone , my computer and a plastic solar panel — that i hide it in the forest .
( laughter ) something might be going on .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
`` and he asked me , `` '' do you know how to use this ? '' '' i said , `` '' i have never seen it . ''
so i was scared .
this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .
i do n't know where to start , where to finish it .
`` but now i think that i would have titled it , `` '' the language of guns . '' '' where are you people ? ''
now we say , oh , my god .
i do n't think that someone may blame google , because it 's doing the right things , even if people like al-qaeda are using google to connect between them .
they ca n't even attain the bachelor 's degree .
and i looked at india and said , really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on india .
`` the first , to my mind , is what i call as `` '' the ideas that have arrived . '' '' these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today . ''
`` the third set of ideas are what i call as `` '' ideas that we argue about '' '' — those are ideas where we have a fight , an ideological battle about how to do things . ''
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently .
we talk of people as human capital .
in other words , if you do n't really invest in the human capital , the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster .
forty years back , computers were seen as something which was forbidding , something which was intimidating , something that reduced jobs .
today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month , of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people do n't have credit history .
but today democracy has become a bottom-up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice , the benefits of being in an open society .
i believe these six factors — the rise of the notion of population as human capital , the rise of indian entrepreneurs , the rise of english as a language of aspiration , technology as something empowering , globalization as a positive factor , and the deepening of democracy — has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen before .
and really there are four things here .
it 's certainly not like china .
it is reflected in the political statements .
these four factors i believe — the ones of primary education , infrastructure , urbanization , and single market — in my view are ideas in india which have been accepted , but not implemented .
and it leads to reservations and other techniques .
this policy is causing gridlock .
at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .
we can use technology for direct benefits .
india has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue , the higher state of diabetes , the higher state of obesity .
and again , within judaism , we have a teaching about god , who is called the compassionate one , ha-rachaman .
and we , as taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god , so we too have to be compassionate .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world could n't exist .
the rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful , fragile glass bowl .
if you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
so , like snoopy , we ca n't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .
and balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion , which has to be there , if you like , at our very roots .
i call that unity god .
now there is , in judaism , a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day .
`` `` you mean god did n't want my bread ? '' ''
`` and god , '' '' he said to the poor man , `` '' is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give . '' '' he looked at the rich man . he held the rich man 's hands and said , `` do n't you understand ? '' he said , `` these are the hands of god . '' ''
many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world .
but why do these groups form ?
israeli scientists frederic libersat and ram gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon .
the roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to , but it does n't choose to , because the venom nixes its motivation to walk , and only that .
but there 's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people , that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents , and there 's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected .
but when i think about cities , i think about people .
i studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather , so i knew that places like paley park did n't happen by accident .
and it was green .
i mean , where would you sit here ?
i wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in paley park , and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this .
and he said to me on that very day , he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people .
so what were we going to do ?
by listening . so i began listening , in fact , thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust .
i became an incredibly geeky zoning expert , finding ways that zoning could address communities ' concerns .
over the course of 12 years , we were able to rezone 124 neighborhoods , 40 percent of the city , 12,500 blocks , so that now , 90 percent of all new development of new york is within a 10-minute walk of a subway .
you ca n't see zoning and you ca n't feel zoning .
now the zoning here was massive , so i felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts , and i spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans .
i wanted to make sure that there were tree-lined paths from the upland to the water , that there were trees and plantings everywhere , and , of course , lots and lots of places to sit .
honestly , i had no idea how it would turn out .
and here is a new park in lower manhattan .
so what 's the trick ?
would you want to stay there ?
`` and they came to me and proposed that they `` '' temporarily disassemble '' '' that third and final section . ''
people stay because they are having a great time .
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream .
we 're going to do it non-invasively using mri .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place .
this may shock you , but we 're literally reading this person 's brain in real time .
this is completely different than automobiles .
automobiles are self-moving things , right ? elevators are automobiles .
and as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles , and i believe we can , with fuel cells or hydrogen , like bmw is really hip on , and lots of other things , then i think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us — of this car-y-ness — and what that means , what we can learn from it .
that tension between the need to express , the need to discover , then you put something new into it , and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship .
that was 100 years right there — did you catch that ?
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot did n't it ?
and it 's done by men and women working just like this , making cars .
it 's that will to live , that need to survive , to express itself , that comes in a car , and takes over people like me .
well , this experience of love , and the experience of design , to me , are interchangeable . and now i 'm coming to my story .
certainly we live in a competitive society .
and one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like pygmalion , we are completely in love with our own creations .
this is sick beyond belief .
we have a shared center ; we have a shared focus — that car stays at the middle of all our relationships .
they would come together , compare notes . then they would work apart , come together , and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that did n't pollute each other 's ideas — but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .
and — at least they told me it was her house , i guess it was at one time , she had a party there or something .
`` nothing . this is all going on , and all i 'm getting is postcards of these guys in las vegas , or whatever , saying , `` '' do n't worry chris , this is really going to be good . '' '' ok ? ''
and so i had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
the engineers all sat at one end of the table , the designers and i sat at the other end of the table , really quiet .
and i hope that you too find that there 's more to design , and more towards the art of the design , than doing it yourself .
and it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
it 's one of the great products of the human mind .
it 's analyzing trends . it 's predicting the future .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
and when they 're missing , it 's a barrier .
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
they contain just a hand that will open and close , a wrist rotator and an elbow .
and we 've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u.s. military , using these prototypes , that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including movable hands .
how do we control them ?
well we need a neural interface , a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it 's intuitive , it 's natural , like for you and i .
and if i tap the nerve ending on a world war ii vet , he 'll still feel his missing hand .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it 's really , really hard .
you have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons — ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts .
and it 's just too hard to use now and for my patients today .
there is not a learning process .
and we 're fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join us .
and you 've got one of these conventional arms .
can you tell us how it worked ?
so for the simple little things like picking something up , i would have to bend my elbow , and then i would have to cocontract to get it to change modes .
tk : so it was a little slow ?
ak : a little slow , and it was just hard to work .
so i did n't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
tk : okay , this was my goal .
you can move each finger . you can move your thumb , your wrist .
can we get more out of it ?
and i have the wrist flexion and extension .
obviously , that 's heavy for amanda .
and in fact , it feels even heavier , because it 's not glued on the same .
ak : it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .
i had to hook it up to a computer , so i could n't just train it anywhere .
here 's amanda using an arm made by deka research corporation .
and it now has a hand that can do different grasps .
she had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces , and she could feel different textures of sandpaper , different grits , ribbon cable , as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin .
she said that when she just ran it across the table , it felt like her finger was rocking .
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state .
i wanted to understand who takes the job .
we usually do n't care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water .
the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves , from our own dross , our cast-offs , and that flow must be maintained always no matter what .
`` we 're going to be okay . '' '' it was a little while later that i started my research with sanitation , and i met that man again . ''
most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights .
they are not an objective reality .
i 'm going to talk to you about power in this 21st century .
now fast forward to 1900 : half the world 's people — more than half — still live in asia , but they 're now making only a fifth of the world 's product .
but let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that i 'm talking about , which is power diffusion .
now that 's a big abstract number .
now , anybody has that capacity , which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors .
and what that means is not that the age of the state is over .
so let me step back and ask : what 's power ?
indeed , if you can learn to use more soft power , you can save a lot on carrots and sticks .
indeed , with the 2008 financial crisis , many people said this was the beginning of the end of american power .
the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
in the 1980s , as america went through a transition in the reagan period , between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california , that was the end of america .
let me mention three reasons why it 's too simple .
and that the chinese wo n't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part , after 2050 , of this century .
power can also be positive sum , where your gain can be my gain .
so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods , things from which all of us can benefit ?
how do we define our national interests so that it 's not just zero sum , but positive sum .
the same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart .
at the time , when i logged into social media , i started seeing more and more egyptians aspiring for political change in the country .
and on january 25th , egyptians flooded the streets of cairo and other cities , calling for change , breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era .
i knew i was being kidnapped by state security .
i was terrified .
so was my family , who started looking for me in hospitals , police stations and even morgues .
it was a time of great hope .
but unfortunately , the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut .
social media only amplified that state , by facilitating the spread of misinformation , rumors , echo chambers and hate speech .
all of us probably know that .
i witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized egyptian society , but this is not just about egypt .
no one could argue against that .
or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with ?
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations .
why ?
`` `` '' because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . '' '' so the key here is empathy . ''
but , of course , i needed help and funds .
the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health , to lobby this approach — we succeeded .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe .
and also — i think — without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we can not build-up civil societies .
and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter , time after time .
so , for those of you unfamiliar , twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept .
and in my case , when i hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
now , the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
we built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
summize built a twitter search engine .
it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information , more good things happen .
( applause ) chris anderson : we 're not quite done yet .
so we 're going to just type a couple of random words into twitter .
and you then ask the question : why is the water hot ?
and that 's a simple question .
here 's another example , which i put up because it 's an example of really important current science .
the amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells , but we do n't know why .
and let me reduce this to the simplest level .
now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you 've got , obviously , an interesting problem .
in boston ... boston is a little bit like namibia in its cell phone coverage , ( laughter ) so that we 're not accustomed to that all the time , but some of the time .
and from that comes the internet .
so simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things .
the second is , and this is a real world statement , they 're cheap .
what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost .
it 's a little paper chip .
you know , no power required .
if we can pull this off , if we can build more function , it will be stackable .
if you take too much out of something that 's simple , you lose function .
this is by de saint-exupery .
`` and he says , `` '' you know you 've achieved perfection in design , not when you have nothing more to add , but when you have nothing more to take away . '' '' and that certainly is going in the right direction . ''
ca : have you started to do that ?
i work with children with autism .
what it does n't help them do is to learn word patterns .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
i told whom ? i told the carpenter .
now we start with a different part of the sentence .
let 's talk about speech .
it 's also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
what if we could do this in freespeech instead ?
it does n't have any specific information in it which is about english .
that 's a pretty interesting concept in itself .
but if you look at what 's inside the engine , it 's actually not very complicated .
and everything that she 's accomplished so far , finishing school , going to college , starting a company , collaborating with me to develop avaz , all of these things she 's done with nothing more than moving her eyes .
but if you can do it , it works really well .
we 're doing changing media .
you ca n't help but actually ripping that spider web apart .
when the magazine — actually , when i got the subscription — it was 12 following pages .
and i do go often into the diary and check if i wanted to change something about the situation .
this is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint .
we let that lie around in the sun .

i 'm being told where to play on the drum .
if i play , for example , holding the stick — where literally i do not let go of the stick — you 'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .
that of a difference . then gradually ... and gradually ...
`` and so therefore , i said to them , `` '' well , look , if you refuse — if you refuse me through those reasons , as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound — then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . '' '' and as a result — once we got over a little hurdle , and having to audition twice — they accepted me . and not only that — what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom . ''
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability — then that person could either enter or not .
so there 's always , always that huge — i mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
but it 's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare i say . but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
it may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . that , to them , means they can walk .
`` for me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music , it 's very easy for me to say , `` '' oh yes , i like that piece . ''
now , i do n't mean just the sound ; i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
now — great imagination , thank you very much .
and of course , i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that — but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?
we had to study from study books .
`` i need to play a piece of music . '' '' `` `` oh , well , this will help your control ! '' '' `` `` well , how ? why do i need to learn that ? i need to relate it to a piece of music . ''
but i do n't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i 'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
and we should save trees in the end .
so it 's enough to bury any industry .
and we 'd rather read it during breakfast , because later we listen to radio in a car , check your mail at work and in the evening you watch tv .
`` in poland , our pages were named `` '' covers of the year '' '' three times in a row . ''
you can see some russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in spain .
just a year after redesigning this newspaper in poland , they name it the world 's best-designed newspaper .
and two years later , the same award came to estonia .
same in poland : plus 13 , up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
you just need inspiration , vision and determination .
and in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
and she 's in the process of mating with this male , and there 's another male on top waiting his turn .
often the queens mate more than once .
she lays eggs , she feeds the larvae — so an ant starts as an egg , then it 's a larva .
then , as soon as the ants — the first group of ants — emerge , they 're larvae . then they 're pupae . then they come out as adult ants .
there 's the nest entrance , there 's a pencil for scale .
they make a midden , a pile of refuse — mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat .
really the question that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation .
it also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the hopi people that are in that area .
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
i do n't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there 's flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep .
so there 's this whole network of chambers .
and they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside .
now ants — most ants , including these , do n't see very well .
so that 's one way that we know the queen is n't directing the behavior of the colony .
does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?
here it is about 40 minutes later .
and lately we 've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three-color system .
and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which .
so , if i change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another .
and this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .
but not every transition is possible . and this shows how it works .
this process changes with colony age , and it changes like this .
and so what the message is , is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another , but the pattern .
but if instead i start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers , i 'm less likely to forage .
( applause )
( guitar music ) i was just thinking that i have been missing you way too long there 's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead but i was just thinking , merely thinking i 've got loads of pictures , i 've got the one of you in that dancing dress but man i feel silly in that dim light just after doing you by the sight of my kodak delights , i am sinking , merely sinking i think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe i 'm a singer without a song if i wait for you longer my affection is stronger
singing is sharing .
and everything but — four of these light objects are stars , and you can see them there — little pluses .
we think there 's on the order — visible to the hubble space telescope , if you had the time to scan it around — about 100 billion galaxies . right ?
so the question should come to your mind is , what kind of design , you know , what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that ?
but if you look out to the nearest set of stars , to the nearest 40 or 50 stars , it 's about 10 years .
so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location of a million galaxies .
now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million .
and every time there 's a galaxy — at its location there 's a galaxy — and if we know anything about the galaxy , which we do , because there 's a redshift measurement and everything , you put in the type of galaxy and the color , so this is the real representation .
so again , you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .
suppose you 're the cosmic designer .
there 's a more complicated process going on here .
what 's the kind of thing you 're going to do ?
and then you put in some randomness , some fluctuations and some randomness , and realize a whole bunch of different representations .
so what i 'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales .
it 's called dark matter .
and when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies .
and so i forgot to tell you the scale .
now we 're into a distance sort of between here and here .
so they 're simple building blocks .
and you have to understand , this is not how it would actually look if you — first , you ca n't travel this fast , everything would be distorted , but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff .
and those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes , and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background .
so i 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
and this is a simple one , because it does n't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it .
so there it is .
that pulls in more material and pulls in more material .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .
we need , you know , 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that i showed you before .
indeed , we stand at a remarkable time in human history , where , driven by refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds , we are building machines of exquisite , beautiful complexity and grace that will extend the human experience in ways beyond our imagining .
now , in space flights to the moon , we can rely upon mission control in houston to watch over all aspects of a flight .
if there 's trouble , there 's not enough time .
yes .
yes .
so let 's accept for a moment that it 's possible to build such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others .
to teach a system how to play a game like go , i 'd have it play thousands of games of go , but in the process i also teach it how to discern a good game from a bad game .
`` indeed , in the book `` '' superintelligence '' '' by the philosopher nick bostrom , he picks up on this theme and observes that a superintelligence might not only be dangerous , it could represent an existential threat to all of humanity . ''
he is supported by people such as elon musk and stephen hawking .
we are not building ais that control the weather , that direct the tides , that command us capricious , chaotic humans .
and furthermore , if such an artificial intelligence existed , it would have to compete with human economies , and thereby compete for resources with us .
now , i 'm going try an experiment . i do n't do experiments , normally . i 'm a theorist .
why should it work , and is this something to do with human beings ?
would they really have different laws ?
there are lots of people who believe that , and i think it is utter baloney .
newton certainly believed that .
and i wo n't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it 's like , and so on .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
but other times they 're not , and you have only probabilities for different outcomes .
now , it 's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies , and then higher energies , and then higher energies , or short distances , and then shorter distances , and then still shorter distances , and so on , is like peeling the skin of an onion .
a trivial example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated .
there are lots of more sophisticated examples .
so the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one .
so here are the themes . we believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities .
symmetry exhibits the simplicity .
the human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents , the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents .
it does n't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
`` people keep asking that when they read my book , `` '' the quark and the jaguar , '' '' and they say , `` '' is n't there something more beyond what you have there ? '' '' presumably , they mean something supernatural . ''
i had absolutely no idea what she meant .
i felt guilty .
the initiative is based on a simple idea : that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us .
it 's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
but something incredible happened when we launched heforshe .
within that first week , at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted , and within that same week , heforshe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media .
we are calling upon governments , businesses , universities , to change their policies .
`` einstein once said , `` '' a human being is part of the whole ... ''
this delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
heforshe is tapping into women 's and men 's dreams , the dreams that we have for ourselves , and the dreams that we have for our families , our children , friends , communities .
thank you .
they have a rough idea of how it works , they have a rough idea of what the side effects are .
`` your physician says , `` '' you know , i think you have some depression . ''
how can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications ?
why do i care about this problem ?
`` so it 's great , good job , but not really that interesting , definitely not publishable . '' '' ( laughter ) he said , `` '' i know , russ . i thought you might say that . '' '' nick is smart . ''
we found somebody who knew about lab stuff .
we took mice and we gave them one p , paroxetine .
we gave some other mice pravastatin .
`` if it 's `` '' pravastatin , '' '' the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline . ''
we published this , and it got some attention .
he found several very important interactions , and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions .
for example , that 's how we can make the quad hover .
we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured .
and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions , and really to follow my journey .
it 's something like life , that once you get in it you ca n't get out .
he built the capital over there .
we were the first film crew in there .
it was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding , people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads , dumping them in the forms .
it is the capital of the country , and it took 23 years to build , which is something they seem to be very proud of over there .
`` and i came home and i said to my father and mother , `` '' i just met this man : does n't have much work , and he 's sort of ugly , funny voice , and he 's a teacher at school . ''
nathaniel kahn : if he did he was a very lucky man .
man : we are the morning workers who come , all the time , here and enjoy the walking , city 's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of bangladesh .
( laughter ) man : your father , is he alive ?
in that way it is so relevant .
he did n't care for how much money this country has , or whether he would be able to ever finish this building , but somehow he has been able to do it , build it , here .
nk : it cost him his life .
he had an enormous amount of love , he loved everybody .
i mean , no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore .
it 's not your phone — it 's your computer .
imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone , and any time you were in a wireless hotspot — free calls anywhere in the world , never pay the cellular company a nickel .
i ca n't figure out why !
ever since that jayson blair jerk ruined it for all of us .
( video ) : jennifer pogue : hello ?
now , i 'm leaving the house . dp : i 'm going for a walk — do you mind ?
`` which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying , `` hey , i just got home . can i call you right back ? '' ''
google bought it , and they 've been working on it for a year .
by the way , this is something that really bothers me .
did you know that ? it 's an outrage .
i 'm going to tell you how to avoid that now .
that 's cute . i do have an email address . you can just ask me .
they 've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing .
dp : bagels , monterey , california .
( laughter ) google : bagels , monterey , california .
this you can ask by voice any question .
what 's the recipe for a certain cocktail ?
i tried this this morning just to make sure it 's still alive .
`` i 'm like , `` '' what 's the word that means you know , like , when the sun , the moon and the earth are , like , all in a line ? '' '' just to see how the recognition was . ''
they put this teeny-weeny little ad , about 10 characters long .
as you can imagine , it 's college kids and old people .
`` but it 's a human being on the line . and it 's gotten me out of so many tough positions like , `` '' when 's the last flight out of chicago ? '' '' you know . it 's just absolutely amazing . ''
nobody has pagers anymore .
so now i 'm going to tell you how to get out of that .
and they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone .
the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services , i got two voicemail messages . one was from a guy named michael stevenson , which should n't be that hard to transcribe , and it was misspelled .
phone : hey you , what 's going on ?
dp : i 'm kinda , like , giving a talk right now .
`` they went around to these carriers and said , `` '' look at these cool features . '' '' and verizon is like , `` '' hmm , no . ''
what 's the problem ?
this is the translator program . they have every language in the world .
this is amazing . this is midomi .
you want to find a place to eat . you shake it .
it proposes a restaurant .
of course , its not just about the iphone .
`` this is amazing . in the wake of all this , verizon , the most calcified , corporate , conservative carrier of all , said , `` '' you can use any phone you want on our network . '' '' i love the wired headline : pigs fly , hell freezes over and verizon opens up its network — no . really . ''
i 've heard there 's something new — a million times more rad than my phone .
i want an iphone .
a multitouch , ipod , wi-fi phone .
i want my friends to look and drool .
and i got an iphone !
and nanny 's great insight , really , was to think , here 's a child who ca n't see .
here 's a little picture of derek going up now , when you were with your nanny .
( applause ) i think that 's just fantastic .
fantastic chap .
derek 's going to l.a. soon , and it 's a milestone , because it means that derek and i will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together , which is quite interesting , is n't it derek ?
ao : you may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking , but derek does it effortlessly . now then .
`` ( laughter ) but in america , they 've coined this term , `` '' the human ipod '' '' for derek , which i think is just missing the point , really , because derek , you 're so much more than an ipod . ''
`` dp : somebody played `` '' chopsticks '' '' like this . ao : just teasing , right ? here we go . ''
dp : i got to improvise with it , adam .
`` ( music : `` '' chopsticks '' '' improvisation ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( clapping ) keep up with derek . ( music ) ( applause ) ''
dp : for one encore . ao : one encore , yes .
( music ) in this one , the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening .
and that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs , or code .
you know , just at the beginning of this year , at the turn of the new year , new york city mayor michael bloomberg made a new year 's resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012 .
but coding does n't have to be like this .
let me show you about what it 's like to code in scratch .
of the millions of projects on the scratch website , there 's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork , and , yes , interactive mother 's day cards .
here 's an example from hong kong , where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor , so the light sensor detects the hole in the board , so as they move the physical saw , the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree .
we 're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us .
when you learn to read , you can then read to learn .
but that 's just where it starts .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
so this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish , but he wanted to keep score , so that each time the big fish eats the little fish , the score would go up and it would keep track , and he did n't know how to do that .
so i showed him .
it 's nothing that , really , they can make use of .
victor had , i 'm sure , been taught about variables in schools , but he really did n't — he was n't paying attention .
now those are important skills that are n't just relevant for coding .
they 're relevant for all sorts of different activities .
and it 's not just about your work life .
that 's what enzymes are doing .
and so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
`` then we go into final shaping , `` '' panning '' '' — which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan . ''
they give us that beautiful brown crust .
only the crust can caramelize . it 's the only place that gets hot enough .
when it gets to about 160 degrees , the proteins all line up and they create structure , the gluten structure — what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread .
and stage 11 , we call it cooling — because we never really eat the bread right away .
but i want to go back now and revisit these steps , and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation , because i really believe that all things can be understood — and this is not my own idea . this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients — that all things can be understood on four levels : the literal , the metaphoric or poetic level , the political or ethical level .
now , in order to harvest it — i mean , what 's harvesting ?
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
it 's not only been killed , but it 's been denied any potential for creating future life .
so we turn it into flour .
so as i said , i think bread is a transformational food .
that 's a transformation , two different things .
so , we 've got now this flour .
`` in stage two , we add water and salt to it , mix it together , and we create something that we call `` '' clay . '' '' it 's like clay . ''
leaven comes from the root word that means enliven — to vivify , to bring to life .
a subtle change in temperature — a subtle change in time — it 's all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . that 's the art of baking .
so all these things are determined by the baker , and the bread goes through some stages , and characters develop .
this is what bread has taught me in my journey .
`` and then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification — if you were to ask me , you know , `` '' what do you worry about the most ? ''
and i think we all found it , simultaneously , an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience .
and how can you figure out how to fix something if you do n't have a clear target ?
well , the problem is that we 've got very complicated forces in the climate system .
here in galapagos , we 're affected by el ninos and la nina .
so anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
we 're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land , the reflectivity .
is co2 produced by man 's activities causing the planet to warm up ?
`` and we 've got it worked out , and we can say , `` yes , co2 is causing the planet to warm up now . '' ''
i 'll show you a few examples of this now .
most of the time it looked like this .
so , this huge floating ice shelf the size of alaska comes from west antarctica .
now , there 's 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses .
nobody imagined that the west antarctic ice sheet was this dynamic .
and it could be larger than that .
this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati , you know , where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level .
okay , the second story takes place here in galapagos .
you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .
imagine that .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
and there 's the temperature up there in 2009 .
you know , that 's the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that 's truly different .
there 's consequences for carbonate organisms .
( applause )
i would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
to test that , we did an experiment on carnegie mellon university campus .
while they were filling out the survey , we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster , and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from facebook profiles .
but a few years back , we did something else .
and should we care ?
you can tell people what you are going to do , and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information .
we get free content .
even more so than george orwell , the author is , of course , aldous huxley .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously , on a collective level .
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety .
i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .
and yet on that same day , 1,100 americans died from smoking .
and knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes , we continue to allow our children , our sons and daughters , to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking .
( laughter ) and so , as you stand back , you see 213,000 vicodin pills , which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states , attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications .
a strange phenomenon .
the vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 .
that , to me , is the big question that we face as a people right now : how do we change ? how do we change as a culture , and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of , and that is our own behavior ?
but why is that ?
so if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets , why are n't we able to make our voices heard ?
right ? one electric car does n't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion combustion engine vehicles .
look at some of the things that are on it , that it says .
so i think it has something to do with the myths , the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness .
71 percent wanted that .
those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments , they had to preserve that socially conscious mission .
the serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round , they need to stick to making more money .
now , let 's be clear , they did n't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen .
and then there 's al gore .
post-white house , he opened an investment firm called generation , where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process .
so what are we waiting for ?
she knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story .
we have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices .
vote with your small change .
4shbab was set up as an alternative to existing arab music channels .
and they look something like this .
( music ) that , by the way is haifa wehbe . she 's a lebanese pop star and pan-arab pin-up girl .
another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
we 're not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
and in this community , we did n't have a television ; we did n't have computers , obviously , radio .
it 's pure white , but it 's not a polar bear .
they 're more rare than the panda bear .
and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest .
and i actually got to sleep within three feet of him , just in the forest , and photograph him .
so i 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i 've done on the polar regions .
and i want people to understand and get the concept that , if we lose ice , we stand to lose an entire ecosystem .
there was no ice around .
and this bear swam out to that seal — 800 lb . bearded seal — grabbed it , swam back and ate it .
and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution .
and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods .
oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
the boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked .
and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out , so it can eat the meat off the bones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
`` he scolded me out , and said , `` '' this is why we 're here . ''
and now you 've got to deliver .
`` and you ca n't publish excuses . '' '' so i had such dry mouth — probably not as bad as now — but i had such , such dry mouth . ''
i put my snorkel in my mouth , and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water .
and this was the first thing she did .
`` he said , `` '' if you get scared , you close your eyes , ya , and she 'll go away . '' '' ( laughter ) so that 's all i had to work with at that point . ''
and after she did this four or five times , she swam by me with this dejected look on her face .
because in her world , you 're either breeding or you 're eating — and i 'm not breeding , so ...
she 's trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer 's dream .
( laughter ) that was n't the only seal i got in the water with .
thank you . thanks very much .
thousands of books have been written about him , but there 's controversy , and it remains , about his looks .
is this the face of leonardo da vinci or is n't it ?
let 's find out .
he drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
`` and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , `` '' the musician . '' '' before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them . ''
( laughter ) but there are 1,100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces .
there is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
and as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case .
they are made in the right order .
yes , it does . he was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made .
the statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces .
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
when i would see her as a little boy , she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs .
`` i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . '' '' i said , `` '' no , i do n't feel right about that . y'all go ahead . y'all go ahead . '' '' and then my brother started staring at me . ''
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
my male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
and it 's interesting , when i teach my students about african-american history , i tell them about slavery .
`` and these older people come up to me now and they say , `` '' mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after 9/11 . '' '' they tell me to say , `` '' no , tell them that we grew up with that . '' '' and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid . ''
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we have n't done that .
but ultimately , those realities are shadowed by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
i think if somebody takes something that does n't belong to them , they 're not just a thief .
i do n't believe that .
i do get tired , as we all do .
( applause ) a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
`` when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , `` '' who are you ? '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm a lawyer . '' '' he said , `` '' you 're a lawyer ? '' '' i said , `` '' yes , sir . '' '' and this man came over to me and he hugged me . ''
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
( applause ) chris anderson : so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
so , i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first i want to tell you why i 'm here .
and you can imagine , if you 're a writer , that things would get really crowded around deadlines .
`` as i was building this space , i thought to myself , `` '' surely i 'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own . '' '' so i did some research . ''
the only thing that might tip you off is the round window .
thank you very much .

so he starts out with one line , and then two , and then four , and then 16 , and so on .
so nature has this self-similar structure .
so it 's just like georg cantor said , the recursion continues forever .
`` i think something 's going on there . '' '' and they said , `` '' well , we can take you there , but you ca n't go inside because that 's the sacred altar , where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields . '' '' and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this . ''
here 's calabashes that issa was just showing us , and they 're stacked recursively .
now , the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman 's soul .
i started collecting aerial photographs of native american and south pacific architecture ; only the african ones were fractal .
so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .
it is not the same pattern at two different scales .
it was n't invented until the 1970s .
so in manghetu sculpture , you 'd see this recursive geometry .
and with each iteration of that algorithm , you learn the iterations of the myth .
and the folks in ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns and would use them strategically .
in the 12th century , hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain .
and i know brian eno says there 's not enough africa in computers , but you know , i do n't think there 's enough african history in brian eno .
so it 's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that 's about mathematics , that it 's not just about singing and dancing .
thank you .
now , at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the exo housing unit , which is just the individual shelter module .
so now we had a hangar space to work in , and prototypes to demo with .
my life is guided by two great passions , and the first is automobiles .
so my parents would go to dinner .
so he and mom went to dinner , and i snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow .
my other great passion is the environment .
we 're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
and with new technology , we 're reducing — and i believe , someday we 'll eliminate — co2 emissions .
so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing .
every morning i drive about 30 miles from my home in ann arbor to my office in dearborn , michigan .
this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system .
the solution is not going to be more cars , more roads or a new rail system ; it can only be found , i believe , in a global network of interconnected solutions .
it was invited , after the first year , by the ars electronica museum in austria , to have it installed in their lobby .
so we got a chance to take the tele-actor to the webby awards in san francisco .
and here 's the result .
what we do n't know is the exact , precise , immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns — winds , ocean currents , precipitation rates , cloud formation , things that bear on the health and well-being of billions of people .
in blizzard winds , the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse .
they cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
each storm scours the atmosphere , washing out dust , soot , trace chemicals , and depositing them on the snow pack year after year , millennia after millennia , creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than 11,000 feet thick .
each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air , a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide — all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell .
but do n't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases ?
do n't we already know how they affect temperatures ?
we banned those chemicals , and we replaced them , unknowingly , with other substances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more potent as heat-trapping , greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide .
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
the wind that rubs against it gives it voice .
i made a film that was impossible to make , but i did n't know it was impossible , and that 's how i was able to do it .
it 's set in montreal some 50 years in the future .
i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
and that brings me to the point of my talk , actually , how constraints , big creative constraints , can boost creativity .
his career i admire a lot .
and he was a perfect fit for the part , and robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance .
he was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film , and to write , direct , and produce the film myself .
but the thing is , had i waited for him until 2042 , my film would n't be a futuristic film anymore , so i just could n't do that . right ?
they are objects of desire .
so that 's kind of a big problem too .
how do you get something that you ca n't afford ?
so here i was with one of my childhood heroes , drawing every single frame that 's in the film to turn that into montreal in the future .
but then , you know , eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality .
and you might end up doing some crazy projects , and who knows , you might even end up going to mars .
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
language changes over time , and it 's a powerful force .
`` `` yesterday i thought . '' ''
there 's actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
i must confess , there 's kind of a third motivation as well .
i put an attractive shell around some new technology .
now , i 'm a fairly slow learner , but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design was n't all that important — making things more attractive , making them a bit easier to use , making them more marketable .
both great designs and actually very innovative too .
now , what brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
one journey from london to new york .
now , design thinking begins with what roger martin , the business school professor at the university of toronto , calls integrative thinking .
with innovations like the great western , we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit .
there we go .
but i do think that perhaps design is getting big again .
and i 'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
and the faster we do that , the faster our ideas evolve .
now , much has been said and written about the aravind eye institute in madurai , india .
they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who can not .
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .
partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory , they used the basement of one of their hospitals .
and instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost cad/cam prototyping technology .
so william beveridge , when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942 , created what became britain 's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
and in these times of change , we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete .
because it gives us a new way of tackling problems .
so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate , we took a sort of more open , collaborative and participative approach .
some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market .
that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly , by getting the process out of the hands of designers , and by getting the active participation of the community , we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions .
i 'm actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?
to do that i think we have to take a more expansive view of design , more like brunel , less a domain of a professional priesthood .
and the first step is to start asking the right questions .
thank you very much .
it is the process by which animals de-animate , appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed .
so then there 's also my favorite example of suspended animation .
you go to the pet store or the toy store , and you can buy these things .
well , i was n't so interested in the swimming .
ten years ago , there was a skier in norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall , and she was there for two hours before they extracted her .
seven hours later , still without a heartbeat , they brought her back to life , and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her .
so what i was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce , maybe , what happened to the skier .
well , i have to tell you something very odd , and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill .
and this precise oxygen concentration , 10 parts per million , that caused suspended animation , is conserved .
so i wondered : might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us ?
and so , we went looking for such things .
ken robinson is here . he talked about the glories of failure .
its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold .
now , this was cosmic .
now , we 'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock-bottom levels , and it was fine .
( applause ) so it 's really incredible for me to be a part of this .
in my childhood , they taught me silence .
we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother .
i used to question this advice , and eight years ago we had an election in kenya , and the results were violently disputed .
was i able to live as a coward , like everyone else , or was i going to make a stand ?
and when the president stood up to speak , i found myself on my feet shouting at the president , telling him to remember the post-election violence victims , to stop the corruption .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things .
i belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country , who want to bring about change , and they 're no longer afraid , and they 're no longer smart cowards .
it 's one of the great questions of our time .
by 2050 , it 's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities .
that 's a big problem . and actually if we carry on as we are , it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve .
as we 're moving into cities , the world is also embracing a western diet .
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers .
and the roads leading up from them to cheapside , which was the main market , were also grain markets .
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
and if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .
and this changes everything .
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place .
here we have food — that used to be the center , the social core of the city — at the periphery .
we do n't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat .
and again , food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision .
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
i believe we already live in sitopia .
it 's people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them .
it 's part of the social life of the city .
this is basically bringing the whole thing together .
( applause )
but it is just a kind of trace of that time .
`` so i just thought , `` '' i 'm going to capture thumbprint , footprint , or whatever traces we leave as humans . '' '' this is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun . ''
so do we really understand what it is , or are we trying to get what we think it is ?
`` then i thought , `` '' i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help . '' '' so i told them , `` '' i 'd like to start an air freshener company . '' '' they said , `` '' of course . ''
`` because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together , or we can break the sculpture and get the dust , but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe . '' '' so , i did this work for her . ''
if we sculpt this , this has two reference points .
i did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .
but if we 're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it , you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints , and the footprints are nothing but passing time .
i 'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we do n't understand as much as we think we do .
so the first question , and you might want to write this down , either on a bit of paper , physically , or a virtual piece of paper in your head . and , for viewers at home , you can try this as well .
and if you can , just scribble a pattern .
second one : can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire ?
we chose mit because , obviously , that 's a very long way away from here , and you would n't mind too much , but it sort of works the same way in britain and in the west coast of the usa .
and there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that 's happening in photosynthesis . for example , one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit , and the other half of the carbon equation , as i 'm very conscious as a trustee of kew , is how much things soak up , and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
it makes no odds . in fact , in the northern hemisphere , we 're further from the sun in summer , as it happens , but it makes no odds , the difference .
that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper . right ?
poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
same for gravity , two concepts , so it 's — which is quite humbling , as a , you know , if you 're a teacher , and you look before and after , that 's quite worrying . they do worse in tests afterwards , after the teaching .
your homework is — you know , how does an aircraft 's wing create lift ?
`` phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the `` '' highlighter version , '' '' which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes . ''
`` i 'd set aside three weeks for this project , and that , i think , is what is meant by `` '' hubris '' '' — ( laughter ) — because it turned out to be three months . ''
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
but all is not lost in translation .
as the koran promises , patience is rewarded , and there are many surprises — a degree of environmental awareness , for instance , and of humans as mere stewards of god 's creation , unmatched in the bible .
but the truth is nobody really knows , and that 's the point .
thank you .
`` and i said , `` '' who do you want to date ? ''
and the question was , will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
are we superman , or are we homer simpson ?
( applause )
i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies , etc .
it 's not very fun to do spectroscopy .
and i thought , well maybe there is lithium-6 in this star , which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet .
`` and actually it 's amazing , because i got phone calls from many reporters asking , `` have you actually seen the planet going into a star ? '' ''
`` and i was saying , `` '' no , excuse me . ''
how we get spectra ?
and we have a cool atmosphere .
sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny , weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .
and now this is a work in progress .
i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy .
it was incredible . the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system , which polluted the atmosphere of this star .
they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien . it comes from a different galaxy .
and there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature .
and doing this for 14 billion years , we end up with this picture , which is a very important graph , showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium .
it 's really difficult .
`` so it 's something which you can always refer to seti and say , `` well , somebody must be doing this , somehow . '' ''
it will take about five years .
and then we will need another 10 , 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of earth-like planets like the one i showed you .
thank you very much .
as a magician , i 'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion .
marco tempest : now tesla 's brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
nt : we are at the dawn of a new age , the age of electricity .
but tesla 's success did n't last .
a world telegraphy center — imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly .
nt : tell me , what will man do when the forests disappear , and the coal deposits are exhausted ?
( applause )
it can get hot in the tropics , so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes .
we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation .
now , we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps .
slam four tons straight down on a pole , and it can take it .
it is growing all around us .
over the past five years together , we have built over 50 unique structures , most of them in bali .
first , we needed safe treatment solutions .
inspire people .
fortunately , balinese culture fosters craftsmanship .
they literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line , and they fired off a gun , and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake , and wherever they put down that stake , that was their new home .
the 20th century was fairly kind to oklahoma city .
and along the way , we became a city of innovation .
there was no bailout on the horizon .
but along at the end of the '80s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named ron norick .
ron norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development was n't incentivizing companies up front , it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate , and so he pushed an initiative called maps that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff .
it built a new sports arena , a new canal downtown , it fixed up our performing arts center , a new baseball stadium downtown , a lot of things to improve the quality of life .
he started maps for kids , rebuilt the entire inner city school system , all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished .
now the city i inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy , and for the very first time , we started showing up on the lists .
the media and the internet love to rank cities .
and then came the list of the most obese cities in the country .
and there we were .
now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places .
well , i finally decided i needed to lose weight , and i knew i could because i 'd done it so many times before , so i simply stopped eating as much .
i had always exercised .
we have a great intersection of highways , i mean , literally no traffic congestion in oklahoma city to speak of .
it was taking place inside the homes , mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids .
and the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
we added a new central park , 70 acres in size , to be right downtown in oklahoma city .
we hosted the olympic trials last spring .
we 're completing our bicycle trail master plan .
highly educated twentysomethings are moving to oklahoma city from all over the region and , indeed , even from further away , in california .
our state health statistics are doing better .
granted , we have a long way to go .
oklahomans leaving for california in large numbers for a better future .
thank you very much for having me here .
and that model is all about doing well and doing good .
and for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell .
you know , i thought it was rather facetious .
and brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change .
beneath our feet , 90 percent of all the world 's ice , 70 percent of all the world 's fresh water .
i 'm extremely proud of him .
we all have responsibility .
and i 've tried to put together something that 's a good start for this .
what i call the human portion — humans and their livestock and pets — versus the natural portion — all the other wild animals and just — these are vertebrates and all the birds , etc. , in the land and air , not in the water . how does it balance ?
so , that 's the stage out of all this . i find , for reasons i do n't understand , i really do have a goal .
they are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere — an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy .
( music ) ray morgan 's voice will come in here .
pm : we have real-time ir scans going out through the internet while the plane is flying . and it 's exploring without polluting the stratosphere . that 's its goal : the stratosphere , the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is — probing that is very important . and also we consider it as a sort of poor man 's stationary satellite , because it can stay right overhead for months at a time , 2,000 times closer than the real gfc synchronous satellite .
you can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it , looking out of its camera .
( applause ) thank you very much . thank you . ( applause )
( laughter ) mk : sorry .
the first i 'll just read . at last , i put in three sentences and had it say what i wanted .
over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life — complex , improbable , wonderful and fragile . suddenly , we humans — a recently arrived species , no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature — have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power . we now wield the paintbrush .
things are going on this decade , next decade ; it 's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do .
and if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be — desirable , sustainable when your kids reach your age — i think we actually can reach it . now , i said this was a warning , not a forecast . that was before — i painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches , and now i 'm beginning to wonder seriously — was this more of a forecast than i wanted ?
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it 's about a gram .
but if you reach out to grab it or hold it , you will destroy it .
we can probably get it down , but it 's possible it 's gone up to a greater destiny up there — ( laughter ) — than it ever had . and i wanted to make — ( applause ) just — ( applause ) but i want to make just two points . one is , you think it 's frivolous ; there 's nothing to it . and yet if i had not been making ornithopters like that , a little bit cruder , in 1939 — a long , long time ago — there would n't have been a gossamer condor , there would n't have been an albatross , a solar challenger , there would n't be an impact car , there would n't be a mandate
and at the end of this i 'm going to tell you what that distillation is .
and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
the second myth is , there are treatments that can help slow , reverse , or even stop aging .
well , the same things happen to our cells .
that 's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person .
these are years that we could get .
we found our first blue zone about 125 miles off the coast of italy , on the island of sardinia .
that 's called the grandmother effect .
we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet , about 800 miles south of tokyo , on the archipelago of okinawa .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ 80 ] percent full .
it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain .
we 're down to one and half right now .
typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two sections .
for this 102 year old woman , her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter .
sterling study . and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project .
it 's white , black , hispanic , asian .
but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk .
that 's physical activity .
they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .
( laughter ) they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe .
so , if you hang out with unhealthy people , that 's going to have a measurable impact over time .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
i love them . so we are in the right quadrant .
thank you very much . and that 's more than enough .
`` `` that misses the point . '' ''
excuse me . you 're missing the point .
we were not real gamers enough , so we had to really talk to them .
or , you know , vib-ribbon was not distributed here in the united states .
and i was just recently at the eve online fan festival in reykjavík that was quite amazing .
so you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like moma 's are kept alive also by the selection of these games .
so when you see a gun , it 's an instrument for killing in the design collection .
we have street fighter ii , because martial arts are good .
it 's very hard to get , of course .
in absence of the code , because , you know , video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases , in absence of that , we acquire the relationship with the company .
the real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
so the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox . you see them here displayed alongside other examples of design , furniture and other parts , but there 's no paraphernalia , no nostalagia , only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers .
and in a way , the video games , the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design .
members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye , and it 's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi .
i would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
ubuntu is at play right now .
where he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea , but he could do it .
these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
now on the day that solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
he turns . he begins to make his way to me .
the croc again continues to shake me .
as it bites the second time , i kick .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
he lays me down . he pulls his shirt off .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he 's able to get me to medical attention .
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
danger is shared . pain is shared .
ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
and yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
and yet still i remained amazed that she was surviving .
she got visibly — ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
and a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant .
i 'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
`` ( laughter ) and she was like , `` '' well , it 'll be about you . '' '' i mean , that 's just incredible humility . ( laughter ) ''
but i think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
the bad news is that mother nature 's back office is n't working yet , so those invoices do n't get issued .
biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
a picture that you 're familiar with — the amazon rainforests .
because the northeastern trade winds , as they go over the amazonas , effectively gather the water vapor .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
they were the ones that did n't get paid .
and if you look at the species level , you saw about fish .
and you ca n't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you 're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset , the most important asset , which is your development asset , that is ecological infrastructure .
well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance .
but on the other hand , if you start measuring , how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use ?
this is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
it causes pollutants being issued , which have an economic cost , health cost and so on .
basically the stuff of life is natural capital , and we need to recognize and build that into our systems .
this is important , because in china in 1997 , the yellow river actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society .
just a year later the yangtze flooded , causing something like 5,500 deaths .
`` we are measuring it because we know that you can not manage what you do not measure . '' '' that 's an example , i think , for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from . ''
it 's about energy emissions .
well i 'm afraid not .
there is an area that is the oceans , coral reefs .
so that 's almost an eighth of society .
so in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations , what we have done is we 've made an ethical choice .
we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
the anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year , becoming a full-time practicing lawyer .
when life brought about a series of death and near-death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in india , similar to 911 in usa .
to address this , i , along with four friends , founded ambulance access for all , to promote life-support ambulance services in india .
the service responded effectively and efficiently , during the unfortunate 26/11 mumbai terror attacks .
since then i 've also co-founded two other social enterprises .
according to world bank estimate , one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year , worsening the condition of the already worse off .
yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place .
( applause ) chris anderson : shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea .
( laughter ) ca : what 's on your mind ?
sm : well , actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees .
i mean , this could be huge .
they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us .
age demographics : the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s , when the baby boomers were still young .
and we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily .
so the traditional media companies , of course , are paying very close attention to these online communities .
now there 's something else that we 've discovered about social media that 's actually quite surprising .
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
well , i actually do n't think that 's going to be the case .
so you may be asking , well why is it important that i know what entertains people ?
( applause )
there are 1 million such schools in india .
`` so i said , `` '' hang on , stop . ''
`` let 's first at least decide what is it we 're trying to achieve . '' '' so with a lot of push and pull and debate , haryana set itself a goal which said : by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge . ''
i went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids ' accounts .
`` and they said , `` '' this is what 's expected of us . ''
`` so right at the beginning of the project , what we said was , `` '' whatever we have to do has to be scalable , it has to work in all 15,000 schools . '' '' and hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has . ''
which basically means giving students things like beads , learning rods , abacuses .
it was a little bit ridiculous .
so today , when you go to a school in haryana , things look different .
of course , they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future .
in the context of education , it 's very difficult to see results quickly .
you know , i think there might be some presentations that will go over my head , but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet .
we depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat .
`` what motivated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific advisers : `` what motivates the pollinators ? '' ''
`` and i thought that they 'd probably say , `` '' well , it 's all about sex . '' '' and chip taylor , our monarch butterfly expert , he replied , `` '' nothing lasts forever . ''
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories .
i believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him .
now twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
it was also twitter as a production mechanism .
elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs .
so once you take flexible identity , anonymity , engagement with the real world , and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story , that 's when things get really interesting .
this is something that does n't usually happen with a twitter parody account .
i think in nonfiction real-time storytelling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
thank you .
that 's more in a single day than all three major u.s. networks broadcast in the last five years combined .
let me give you an example so that you can understand what i mean .
but it did n't work .
they even studied the universal principles of polite language , which i did n't even actually know existed until this research happened .
`` so i report it and i say , `` i 'm in this photo and i do n't like it , '' and then we dig deeper . ''
of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions , but we also rely very heavily on iteration , research , testing , intuition , human empathy .
what would these products start to mean to you ?
and so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was .
and okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on .
i could do this all day every day and i ca n't keep up .
i call it cognitive surplus .
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .
and using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts .
and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we 're getting now .
the gap is between doing anything and doing nothing .
and someone who makes a lolcat has already crossed over that gap .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
and you can see immediately what happened , right ?
the fine broke the culture of the daycare center .
but that 's not right .
not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible , that incompatibility can persist over long periods .
so the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you 're relying on the economic part of the bargain — as with the parents paying the teachers — and when you 're relying on the social part of the bargain , when you 're really designing for generosity .
it 's value created by the participants for each other .
this is good . i like lolcats as much as the next guy , maybe a little more even , but this is also a largely solved problem .
it 's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .
it 's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .
it 's the hollowing out of small towns .
he was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .
so at the time of being invited down there , we were based in san francisco , and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009 , spending about half our time in bertie county .
we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we 're able to do in a rural place like bertie county , that , as designers and builders , you ca n't do everywhere .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .
there is n't a single licensed architect in the whole county .
this is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days .
every time he has visitors , it 's the first place that he takes them .
and then she 'll call out a math problem — so let 's say four times four — and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it .
it 's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom .
right now i should say , there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home internet connection .
it also means that designers are no longer consultants , but we 're teachers , and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation .
and so this starts in four weeks , at the end of the summer , and my partner and i , matthew and i , just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it .
so over the course of two semesters , the fall and the spring , the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space .
so the first project , which will be built next summer , is an open-air farmers ' market downtown , followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year .
so i want you to meet three of our students .
she wants to go to college , but she wants to come back to bertie county , because that 's where her family is from , where she calls home , and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she 's been fairly fortunate in .
so this building downtown , which may very well become the site of our future farmers ' market , is now the classroom .
more importantly , the verses in the koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about forgiveness , benevolence or patience .
i wanted to learn , but i could not go to school for four years .
and they must have dreamt about a better future for him .
why did he die and i lived ?
i fought in kashmir .
and i could n't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another about their dreams for such a life .
and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) ce : i was optimistic , and all was right with the world .
( applause ) there was a second surgery — which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospitalized , i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .
they 'd never made one from previously-recorded materials .
or roger 2.0 .
this is the first version of my computer voice .
now i have spoken my last words , and i do n't even remember for sure what they were .
for almost all the years of life on earth , there was no intelligent life .
it was about 1960 .
but i 'm not here from the chamber of commerce .
( laughter ) ce : all of this has happened in the blink of an eye .
for billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
we are born into a box of time and space .
i can not speak ; i can only type so fast .
not everybody has the patience of my wife , chaz .
when you see me today , i look like the phantom of the opera .
sometimes they assume i am deaf .
re : wait . i have one more thing to add .
if the judge ca n't tell the machine apart from the human , the machine has passed the test .
i now propose a test for computer voices — the ebert test .
we will talk today about local warming .
( laughter ) this is a very serious newspaper ; it 's times of england — very serious . this is a very — ( laughter ) — gentlemen and ladies , be serious .
and be careful , your genes are in danger .
you should care about your posture — this is not right .
can you extract from chris another minute and a half for me , because i have a video i have to show you .
by the way , i must admit , my english is not so good , i did n't know what is scrotal ; i understand it 's a scrotum .
digital scrotum , digital media .
and this is what the young generation says .
( applause ) now , i have some mini ted prizes , this is the philips bodygroom , one for our leader . ( applause )
( applause )
it arrived in london in 1832 , and every four or five years another epidemic would take 10,000 , 20,000 people in london and throughout the u.k .
and he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies , but nothing had really stuck .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
as you get further and further away from the pump , the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .
but because of what snow did , because of this map , because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map , we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people , cities like this one are in fact sustainable things .
in america , we do n't like to talk about slavery , nor do we look at it as a global industry .
thank you .
audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long .
it 's fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
we 'll never see through it , it 's opaque to light .
gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass — totally transparent .
dream with us .
thank you .
so passwords are something that i hear a lot about .
so we did this , and we collected 5,000 passwords , and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with .
so what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using , or that we could find information about in the research literature .
so to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords , they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form , called a hash , and so what they 'll do is they 'll make a guess as to what a password is , run it through a hashing function , and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list .
a smart attacker , on the other hand , does something much more clever .
here are some examples .
in fact , everybody who i talk to , who i mention i 'm doing password research , they point out this cartoon .
so what we found in this study was that , surprisingly , pass phrases were not actually all that good .
on the other hand , we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well , and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better .
are they disney princess fans ?
`` `` '' iloveyou '' '' appears many times in many different languages . ''
or we think about things that make us happy , and we create our password based on things that make us happy .
here is the old story — we 've already heard a little bit about it : biology is war in which only the fiercest survive ; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating , destroying and dominating competition ; politics is about your side winning at all costs .
and again , we have no way of knowing , but it 's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged .
of course , with agriculture came the first big civilizations , the first cities built of mud and brick , the first empires .
and then another communication technology enabled new media : the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
and from literate populations , new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge , religion and politics .
but capitalism , as we know it , is only a few hundred years old , enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies , such as the joint-stock ownership company , shared liability insurance , double-entry bookkeeping .
now of course , the enabling technologies are based on the internet , and in the many-to-many era , every desktop is now a printing press , a broadcasting station , a community or a marketplace .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they ca n't trust each other , are not going to exchange .
and although they were screened and did n't know about the game and had never played the game before , proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50 .
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness , that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be .
in the u.s. , in the philippines , in kenya , around the world , citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms .
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation ?
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines .
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking .
what forms of suffering could be alleviated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
i do n't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ; it 's going to require effort .
they made all the stories .
and it 's a picture we 've seen several times .
i live right there in the west village , so the plume was luckily blowing west , away from us .
people were out .
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating — they were all on display there on those streets .
same thing to the question of , who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood ?
`` and this is increasingly what we 're starting to see on the web in a bunch of interesting ways — most of which were n't around , actually , except in very experimental things , when i was writing `` '' emergence '' '' and when the book came out . ''
and the old one looked like this .
this is not the future king of england , although it looks like it .
and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs , and so you have kind of an authority — a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it .
i could put up a feed of all those links generated by technorati on the right-hand side of my page , and they would change as the overall ecology of the web changes .
and there are all these interesting tools .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
( laughter ) but the interesting thing is , you can broaden the search a little bit .
so right here — now this is a big category , you have smaller percentages , so this is 0.7 percent — dan dennett , who 'll be speaking shortly .
and ok , i did n't learn anything new there as well — that 's pretty obvious .
i 'll go very quickly .
`` and so the question is , `` '' why is this happening ? '' '' it 's not being imposed by fiat from above . ''
in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named lp draper .
to give you some perspective , uber in los angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day , today ...
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
in the us , we spend 7 billion hours a year , wasted , sitting in traffic .
we even have skyscrapers built for cars .
that 's the world we live in today .
because if we did , that ride would be a lot cheaper — up to 50 percent cheaper — and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars .
and so the big question for us was : would it work ?
in san francisco , before uberpool , we had — well , everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted .
well , that is what the us government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
if we could , it 's obviously something we should do .
would we have parks in the place of parking lots ?
now , i 'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five , 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality ?
and so that was a little bit what it was about .
and so when you go through that growth , you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time .
this thing 's taken off , you 're affecting the whole global economy , basically , at this point .
do you want that ?
`` so even in new york — we have a blog post we call `` '' 4 septembers '' '' — compare the earnings september after september after september . ''
and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor .
so i think there 's a lot of good .
and i also reported that we 'd made this mind-blowing discovery — this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole , consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane .
so we are very encouraged by these results .
this is central park , one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in america .
but recently , we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect , from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts .
this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time , and years later , my brother and i moved back to washington , d.c. , and we started to ask the question , would it be possible , in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park , to compose music for a landscape ?
so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park , but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory .
when they ask for a c.d . or an mp3 version , we just ca n't make that happen , and the reason is because this is n't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record .
but what we 're doing , integrating gps with music , is really just one idea .
back where i 'm from , most of our caves are made of lava rock , because we have a lot of volcanoes out there .
but the caves i want to share with you today are made completely of ice , specifically glacier ice that 's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of oregon , called mount hood .
the second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
now these days , with so many people hiking around , it 's pretty hard to find a new cave , so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of oregon 's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before .
now each year , as new snow lands on the glacier , it melts in the summer sun , and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice , and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier , forming big networks of caves , sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock .
warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down , and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up , gets into the cave , and melts the ceilings back taller and taller .
there were no gps coordinates for it , and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the sandy glacier .
well , cave maps are n't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels .
so when you 're done surveying , you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well , and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this , and it 'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage , kind of like an ant farm view .
the inside of it was coated with ice , so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping .
for example , this is a noble fir seed we found .
like i said earlier , the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now , but that 's not true .
you just have to be willing to look and go where people do n't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it , because it might be in your own backyard .
our main effort was inside iraq , and our specified mission was to defeat al qaeda in iraq .
we honed our combat skills , we developed new equipment , we parachuted , we helicoptered , we took small boats , we drove , and we walked to objectives night after night to stop the killing that this network was putting forward .
now , we did what we knew , how we had grown up , and one of the things that we knew , that was in our dna , was secrecy .
we had to change our culture about information .
edward snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand .
he also took a lot of documents that he did n't have the knowledge to know the importance of , so i think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about edward snowden .
and we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials , depending on where we are .
and part of the reason i love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood , i notice they react completely differently .
but the challenge is , as we move to cities , cities are built in these two materials , steel and concrete , and they 're great materials .
if it burns in a forest fire , it 's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well .
`` now obviously , every time i bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , `` are you serious ? thirty stories ? how 's that going to happen ? '' ''
if i asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire , it does n't happen , right ? we all know that .
it 's really just the structure that we 're talking about .
and it sticks with us . it really does stick with us , because when we are treated that way , we feel invisible sometimes , or talked around and at .
that 's why i 'm sitting here .
but i also want to point something else out : each one of you is better than anybody else at something .
why is it important now ?
so what i 'm asking you is , the world is hungry .
this would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles , plasma inside , centered on the pitcher 's mound , and that would move away from the pitcher 's mound slightly faster than the ball .
so if you were watching this whole thing from a hill , ideally , far away , what you 'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds , followed by a blast wave spreading out , shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium , and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city . ( laughter ) so the major league baseball rules are a little bit hazy , but — ( laughter ) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09 , i think that in this situation , the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base ,
and i had someone write in , i 've had people write in about , can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken ?
so i decided to try to figure this out myself .
and for some data centers , you might get two of these pieces of information .
there 's a couple of other contenders , especially everyone always thinks of the nsa .
and sometimes not .
( applause )
that distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
while it 's kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it 's we , life , who are searching .
thank you .
i guess so . because in a way , if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it 's the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that 's going on everywhere in the planet .
and therefore it will become intolerable — what compassion is , is where it will become intolerable for us , totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is , and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they can not have a bite of food and they have no place , or they 're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth .
we do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
what do they want from me ? like , who 's that ?
`` i need a hundred billion . '' '' so i 'm like that . ''
when you 're no longer locked in yourself , and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world , that enables you to let your mind spread out , and empathize , and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing , and realizing that you are the other being , somehow by that opening , you can see the deeper nature of life . and you can , you get away from this terrible iron circle of i , me , me , mine , like the beatles used to sing .
and we feel ourselves differently . it 's totally strange . it 's totally strange .
the good time is over when you think , how good is it ?
he looked a little sad , because he said , well , a hundred years ago , they went and took everything away from the haves .
they did n't help at all .
but of course , what you said , i think the key to saving the world , the key to compassion is that it is more fun .
because when you open up like that , then you ca n't just — what good does it do to add being miserable with others ' misery ?
you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
so the first person who gets happy , when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of , how happy am i , where you 're always dissatisfied — as mick jagger told us . you never get any satisfaction that way .
so let 's move to chapter two : the oil era .
you might find this strange , but in my family we have different accents .
and when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
that is in less than 60 years .
cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
it is that thing that we pump out of the ground , we burn tons of , probably most of you used it coming to doha .
do you worry much ?
on the other hand , there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors .
thank you very much .

yves behar : and in scenic switzerland for me .
this is a 100,000-volt tesla coil that i built in my bedroom , much to the dismay of my mother .
( laughter ) fn : and i brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across australia — also the u.s. and japan .
to combine engineering and design and ...
it goes 150 miles an hour .
it was wonderful working with yves behar .

they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
with an amazing group of women , i co-founded the libyan women 's platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
and every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles — freedom , dignity , social justice — that we first held .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [ aftermath ] of the revolution .
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
for peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
`` thus we are told that `` '' my mercy encompasses all things . '' '' thus we are told that `` '' my mercy takes precedence over my anger . '' '' may we all be granted a grace of mercy . ''
so even before that impact was known , even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution , scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided earth 's life 's history into these two episodes : mesozoic , the middle life , and the cenozoic , the recent life .
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
the time it took to reach maximum body size ?
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
that 's where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
228 million years old , we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur : that 's the ur-dinosaur .
a three-and-a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , meat-eater , a two-legged animal .
a predator . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the earth — africa , india , antarctica , australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
here 's some others .
could i have the second little video clip ?
man : look at that set of choppers ! yeah , he 's a big one .
sixty-five . wow .
whoa !
it depended on the shape of their skull , though , so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile , probably a male .
they 're only between 13 and 14,000 feet , but if you go in the warm part of the year , it 's o.k .
you get divided , and a continent 's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree , or you 're crafty , and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division , or you 're living peacefully on each side , and on one side you just go extinct , and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain similarity between continents .
so if we move back , this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life .
sometimes i would see bones when there was a body there .
something was going on in the background . i headed to new york to a studio .
what about all the kids like me that were in school — kids like some of you out there — that were in school and did n't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?
dinosaurs was one of them .
we met them in their early stages in high school . they were — failing to poor students , and they are now — one at the university of chicago , another in illinois .
and we created a track record .
it 's gone through science as an inquiry , which was a big advance , and dewey back at chicago — you learn by doing .
i have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years .
all right .
and today , i will use selam , the earliest child ever discovered , to tell you a story of all of us .
you do n't need to remember that .
we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet .
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools , 2.6 million years ago .
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old .
so , for us , paleoanthropologists , our job is to find the hard evidence , the fossil evidence , to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development .
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks , i made my way .
`` they would find a bone and tell me , `` '' here is what you 're looking for . '' '' i would say , `` '' no , that 's an elephant . '' '' again , another one , `` '' that 's a monkey . '' '' `` `` that 's a pig , '' '' etc . ''
`` so one of my assistants , who never went to school , said to me , `` '' listen , zeray . ''
so then , once you 've done that , the next stage is to know what it is .
and you see that in humans , because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex , it 's called .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species , known as australopithecus afarensis .
the next exciting question is , girl or boy ?
to answer this question , we can phrase another question .
but in humans , we continue to grow our brains .
that 's why we need care from our parents .
it supports your tongue from behind .
it 's , in a way , your voice box .
it determines the type of voice you produce .
so if you were there 3.3 million years ago , to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother , she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human .
`` maybe you 're wondering , `` '' so , you see this ape feature , human feature , ape feature . ''
still , in my opinion , we have two choices .
i am for the second option , and i 'm sure many of you are .
let 's talk about the state .
so in fact , something we realized , we ca n't just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
we love the fact that the web is open .
and we also have , if you 've read the book about the filter bubble , the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like .
i want a web where i can use healthcare with privacy and where there 's a lot of health data , clinical data is available to scientists to do research .
i want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want .
there are lots of sites where people have started to put together a magna carta , a bill of rights for the web .
so we started examining the r & d and innovation labs of silicon valley .
and what we found was , as we progressed in our research , was , that we were asking really the wrong question .
so that 's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india .
well , in 2010 , they decided they 're not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
there are 433,000 people now at ibm , out of which 98,000 are remaining in the u.s. , and 150,000 are in india .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop — and anita hill .
the first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
( applause ) he 's actually here today . ( applause )
we do n't want one icon .
and there 's a lot to be overwhelmed about , to be fair — an environmental crisis , wealth disparity in this country unlike we 've seen since 1928 , and globally , a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity .
it 's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
and on a particularly dark night of december of 2004 , i sat down with my family , and i said that i had become very disillusioned .
i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .
but what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force .
the activists i interviewed had nothing in common , literally , except for one thing , which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences .
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory , or certainty , or security even .
i do n't know what the hell i 'm doing here .
and the peak time for that was the 30s , because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
shamelessly cheap is something , i think — this will wake you up .
`` i was driving down 7th avenue one night at 3 a.m. , and this steam pouring out of the street , and i thought , `` '' what causes that ? '' '' and that — who’s to say ? ''
this is a tiny joke — e-zr pass . one letter makes an idea .
truth about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover , in the middle of the night , this came to me like a xerox — all i had to do was write it down .
`` i would just like to add a crass commercial — i have a kids ' book coming out in the fall called `` '' marvel sandwiches , '' '' a compendium of all the serious play that ever was , and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores , crummy bookstores , tables on the street in october . ''
until someone notices me , and i just panic .
and i 'm still quiet .
`` and then , slowly , all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me and ask , almost in unison , ( voice-over , several voices ) `` '' have you forgotten your name ? '' '' as the chant gets louder , i want to respond , but i do n't . ''
and for that one , i got to do the voice of space invader .
`` i hit `` '' refresh . '' '' ( video ) comment : where is part two ? whereeeee ? i need it nowwwww ! : p ( laughter ) ss : people other than my mom were saying nice things about me , on the internet ! ''
( video ) comment : could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth ?
ss : ok , ok , ok , two things .
and number two , i clearly have a pakistani accent .
every time the phone rang , i would run to the bathroom so i would not have to answer it .
for example , the sea is described as wine red , people 's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple .
it was not a part of their normal .
so when i first read the comments on the video , my initial reaction was to take it all very personally .
when a female or minority student does not succeed .
( laughter ) just like the color blue for ancient greeks , minorities are not a part of what we consider normal , because normal is simply a construction of what we 've been exposed to , and how visible it is around us .
or i can challenge that preexisting notion of normal with my work and with my voice and with my accent and by standing here onstage , even though i 'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom .
let 's build a better map of the world .
it tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor , that small countries can not escape their larger neighbors , that vast distances are insurmountable .
connectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century : planetary urbanization .
here we are in vancouver , at the head of the cascadia corridor that stretches south across the us border to seattle .
the bohai rim around beijing , the yangtze river delta around shanghai and the pearl river delta , stretching from hong kong north to guangzhou .
but equally importantly , you can not calculate any of their individual value without understanding the role of the flows of people , of finance , of technology that enable them to thrive .
but equally importantly , it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into south africa and indeed , into the entire african continent .
cities want to be part of global value chains .
but right now , there are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving .
we know that summit after summit in new york and paris is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
and that 's why our financial community needs to understand that connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century .
north america does not need more walls , it needs more connections .
( applause ) but the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world .
but now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet .
now this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources and its industrial output .
cities and countries are learning to aggregate into more peaceful and prosperous wholes .
they 're building a trade corridor stretching from northeast india through myanmar and bangladesh to southern china .
even though asia is home to the world 's fastest growing militaries , these same countries are also investing billions of dollars in each other 's infrastructure and supply chains .
we do n't just build connectivity , we embody it .
a map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny .
mike matas : and so throughout the whole book , al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
and throughout the book , there 's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
this one shows the wind potential all around the united states .
and it works the exact same way .
listen to understand .
that must be quite the experience to be there .
the next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that mike 's car was down at the bridge .
`` you let me speak , and you just listened . '' '' shortly after this incident , i received a letter from kevin 's mother , and i have that letter with me , and i 'd like to read it to you . ''
during that time , he shook my hand on three occasions .
`` on that final handshake , he looked at me , and he said , `` kevin , i 'm sorry , but i have to go . '' ''
i stayed in my room instead of socializing .
i did n't want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
i had always assumed i was immune to needing acceptance .
in fact , even now , when i was talking to people about what this talk was about , i made up a cover story and i even hid the truth about my ted talk .
and that shakes me to the core .
( applause )
i want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into , let 's say , a small chip .
picornaviruses — these are things that include the common cold and polio , things like this .
you 're looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evolving very fast .
well , for a long time , since i was in graduate school , i 've been messing around making dna chips — that is , printing dna on glass .
and each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus .
that 's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere — it 's like boogeremia , basically .
rhino 's the common cold , and you all know what polio is , and you can see that these signatures are distinct .
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ; it 's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .
how do i know which rhinovirus i have ?
now , this is kind of a cheap shot , because i know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is , and i in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart , but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer ?
but that 's , again , shooting fish in a barrel , you know , right ?
and how do we do the positive control here ?
and the idea is , let 's experimentally inoculate people with virus .
and basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus .
they got a shot of virus up the nose , let 's see what happens .
here 's another guy . you can play the diagnosis game yourself here .
here 's another individual , sampled on two separate days — repeat visits to the clinic .
this individual has parainfluenza-1 , and you can see that there 's a little stripe over here for sendai virus : that 's mouse parainfluenza .
10-day history of fevers , night sweats , bloody sputum — she 's coughing up blood — muscle pain .
there 's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure , and so basically — and what do they learn from it ?
and i 'm no pathologist , but you ca n't tell much from this .
but that does n't tell us too much , so we actually clone the whole thing .
these guys really do have this virus .
so , it opens up more questions than it answers , i 'm afraid , but that 's what , you know , science is really good at .
this was all done by folks in the lab — i can not take credit for most of this .
i started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer .
technology has made our world increasingly open , and for the most part , that 's great , but all of this openness may have unintended consequences .
they had satellite phones , and they even had night vision goggles .
and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan , where they monitored the bbc , al jazeera , cnn and indian local stations .
they did all of this in real time .
the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government .
`` and they said to him , `` '' who are you , and what are you doing here ? '' '' and the man replied , `` i 'm just an innocent schoolteacher . '' ''
terrorists are doing this .
a search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die .
there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so .
but they 're adapting quickly .
recently , the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states , who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states .
with great precision i actually was able to make this just the other day , a very cute little ducky .
perhaps like this .
all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies , and that has a radical implication for our security , because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities .
every year , thousands of cochlear implants , diabetic pumps , pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people .
it 's a great challenge for them .
but it goes deeper than that .
what to do ? what to do about all this ?
for those of you who follow me on twitter , i will be tweeting out the answer later on today . ( laughter ) actually , it 's a bit more complex than that , and there are no magic bullets .
i do n't have all the answers , but i know a few things .
we 've already seen examples of this working well .
great .
when i laid out my plan , i realized that i faced three main challenges : first , creating a sensor ; second , designing a circuit ; and third , coding a smartphone app .
this prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night .
`` and if you do not let us continue with our work , i will hold a press conference here , right now , right in this road , and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era . '' '' then he was kind of troubled , and asked me for a compromise . ''
`` `` safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? '' ''
we demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city , up to eight stories high , the tallest of them .
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
we could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks , every week , but we could not change this corrupt practice .
we removed the kiosks .
seen from those stairs , all politicians today seem the same , and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism .
they are not . they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world .
efharisto and kalinihta .
my dad was a roofer , construction guy , he owned small businesses , and at 80 , he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance .
there is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood , and while i was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career , there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio .
once i bought the building for about 18,000 dollars , i did n't have any money left .
very significant people in the city and beyond would find themselves in the middle of the hood .
`` if we wanted to show `` '' car wash , '' '' we could . ''
we found that that was so exciting for folk , and people were so responsive to the work , that we had to then find bigger buildings .
it was a difficult project to finance , because banks were n't interested in the neighborhood because people were n't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there .
and so we just started imagining , what else could happen in this building ?
we 've also started to collect memorabilia from american history , from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood .
`` if i were a traditional developer , i would be talking about buildings alone , and then putting a `` '' for lease '' '' sign in the window . ''
because i think it 's not just a cultural space or housing ; there has to be the recreation of an economic core .
jc : it 's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for 20 years .
are there any methods you 've found that have helped break through ?
so i 've found that if you 're a theater person , you have outdoor street theater festivals .
jc : so interesting .
it can not be consciously a contributor .
that implies a lot of trust .
it 's not that simple .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it .
compassion is not defined in one form .
there 's no american compassion .
`` you ca n't say , `` '' please love me . '' '' love is something you discover . ''
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
it has got to be you .
compassion is going to be limited .
then that again transforms into giving , into sharing .
there is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
( laughter ) you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
but then , how to act compassionately if you do n't have compassion ?
you 'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that 's what you are .
they 're here , getting better and better every day .
please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
i think of like , transformers , like how panels open and then they fold , they fold in , and then you close that panel .
and i had this idea : what if i could , in effect , virtually embed , and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers ?
so , i 'd like to show the clip of the film .
soldier : we 're not supposed to talk to the media .
voice : the real deal , man ! narrator : you ready ?
mm : i will not go back .
kevin shangraw : the iraqi people are who we are there to help — and we just killed one .
he served — ( applause ) — with the marines , and i want to tell you a little , brief story .
and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with , which is , i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war , and about politics .
( video ) sp : today is sport . [ unclear ] radio : [ unclear ] christian soldiers .
it 's not true . very unsafe .
soldier : right there .
soldier : motherfuckers !
soldiers : get your vest on !
hey , get over the fucking — yeah , yeah .
i do n't think there was anything left from his abdominal down .
this is blood .
medics who were terrified and could n't perform .
news anchor : more violence in iraq .
i 'll do that , then i 'm gon na jerk off .
because these pages smell like linds , and there wo n't be any time for jerking off tomorrow .
ds : now — ( applause ) — thanks .
and the tone from the email was , you know , it had been a very bad day , obviously .
and if you let time go by , it kind of softens and smooths the edges .
so , it was n't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal .
and i 'm as fiery as the next person , but i really think — you know , different speakers have talked about their concern for the world , and my concern is that we have to have these conversations .
i 'll share one story .
and for me , one of the most profound stories someone shared with me , that then became my story , was — for those of you who have n't seen the film , and it 's not a spoiler — it 's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents , where people get in front of humvees and they get killed .
he 's a big guy .
`` ♫ from bronx to berlin , we took the tour european ♫ ♫ all vocal yeah , we widit , call the album `` '' what is it ?

mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and do n't biodegrade .
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific , while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas .
and this .
this is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
we have to throw it away .
dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives .
sri lankan men invest in their businesses .
again , we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing .
one very telling study looked at a program in india that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor , and they found that 30 percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given for cash .
what if , instead , we use technology to put cash , whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person 's hands .
we 've sent cash to 35,000 people across rural kenya and uganda in one-time payments of 1,000 dollars per family .
something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption .
the u.s. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq — that 's that big green thing there — and little else .
when we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here 's how the world looked .
so , why do n't we hear more about the world ?
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of africa , india or south america — places that are home to more than two billion people .
and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
how many of you know who that is ?
in fact , today , if you are middle class and connected via the internet , you can download stories at the touch of a button or the swipe of a screen .
you can listen to a podcast about what it 's like to grow up dalit in kolkata .
stories can even make it easier for us to talk about the deaths of people in our societies who do n't matter , because they make us care .
you have n't done anything .
secondly , i think often we are drawn towards characters and protagonists who are likable and human .
and this makes sense , of course , right ?
i learned that actually , you do n't have to like someone to recognize their wisdom , and you certainly do n't have to like someone to take a stand by their side .
again , you know , typical african justice , right ?
and so we stand there facing each other , and he looks at me , and he says sorry , but he looks at me with this unbridled fury .
`` he looks at me with this look as if to say , `` you , with your shiny skin and your bike , you 're angry at me ? '' ''
so it was a hard lesson that he did n't like me , but you know what , he was right .
the third reason that i think that stories do n't necessarily make the world a better place is that too often we are so invested in the personal narrative that we forget to look at the bigger picture .
so firstly , the world would be a better place , i think , if audiences were more curious and more skeptical and asked more questions about the social context that created those stories that they love so much .
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
and yet , even in the best-resourced countries , for example here in europe , roughly 50 percent of affected people do n't receive these interventions .
in reality , take a guess .
it was then that i came across these books , and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health .
in rural uganda , paul bolton and his colleagues , using villagers , demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and , using a randomized control design , showed that 90 percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages .
similarly , using a randomized control trial in rural pakistan , atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors , who are community maternal health workers in pakistan 's health care system , could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed , again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates . roughly 75 percent of mothers recovered as compared to about 45 percent in the comparison villages .
now for me , task shifting is an idea with truly global significance , because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries , i think it has a lot of significance for better-resourced countries as well . why is that ?
but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities .
astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet , and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an earth-like planet that might be able to harbor life , but we have n't seen any of them .
this is nasa 's famous picture of the pale blue dot .
we 'll see something like that , a slightly blurry picture of the earth , because we 're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of mars .
the moon has moved in front of the sun .
it blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it .
well , what 's going on ?
well that would look something like this .
we call that our flower petal starshade .
boom , we get planets orbiting about it .
this is a sub-scale star shade .
the base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter .
( applause )
and if we can predict , then we can engineer the future .
it assumes that people are looking out for what 's good for them .
mother theresa , she was rational .
if we 're looking at iran , the president of the united states we would like to think , may have some influence — certainly the president in iran has some influence — but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person does n't know much about iran , or about energy policy , or about health care , or about any particular policy .
they care about the outcome . they 'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible .
how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information , but once we know where they are we 're worried about where they 're going to be headed in the future .
the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions , under its own domestic political pressures .
and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like , but it 's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with , and that a lot of others can live with .
he is on the way down .
ok , so i 'd like you to take a little away from this .
i would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .
we 've got 800 people in tehran who watch tedtalks .
( applause )
this is a rubens ' tube . it 's one of many i 've made over the years , and i have one here tonight .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
so there 's a lot of sentences , so a lot of stars , and after rendering all of the audio , this is what we get .
i think , after 30 years , the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning .
actually , it 's all just an idea .
sw : yeah .
sw : it could make her sneeze . but more importantly , her research could help einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat .
well , that 's really cool , but what einstein 's really hoping is that maybe he 'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .
sw : yeah . she especially likes his latest achievement , spaceshipone .
e : ow , ow , ow .
if the children of the uganda need another dance partner , einstein could sure fit the bill , because she loves to dance .
( laughter ) sw : or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin , and einstein can sing along with some opera ?
( laughter ) or maybe stu just needs another backup singer ?
sw : yeah , that 's right . but you do n't like to drink beer , einstein .
e : hey , baby .
e : yee haw .
( laughter ) sw : and since she 's such a big fan , she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of march .
sw : again .
`` einstein , do you want to say `` '' hi '' '' to all the owls ? ''
sw : very good .
so , let 's see .
this is the $ billion dollar o-gram , and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press .
and it mushroomed slightly . afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to 3,000 billion .
and when you 're lost in information , an information map is kind of useful .
let 's take a look .
so this , swine flu — pink .
and there 's another pattern here as well . can you spot it ?
see that gap there ? there 's a gap , and it affects all the other stories .
why is there a gap there ?
data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights , and it 's all around us , and it can be mined very easily .
it 's not a particularly great metaphor in these times , especially if you live around the gulf of mexico , but i would , perhaps , adapt this metaphor slightly , and i would say that data is the new soil .
and , all right , i 'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit .
let me show you this .
yeah , retail therapy might help .
so there 's a titanic amount of data out there now , unprecedented .
but if you ask the right kind of question , or you work it in the right kind of way , interesting things can emerge .
i was curious about this , so it led me to the work of a danish physicist called tor norretranders , and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms .
who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp ?
let 's have a look .
now you can also do this with soldiers .
of course , 2.1 million .
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
it actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration .
they 're not as true as they could be .
and the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to google hits .
and once you 've curated that data , and once you 've cleaned that data , and once it 's there , you can do cool stuff like this .
it 's even fun to engage with them because it 's visual .
they can measure the types of information that we want , things such as : bodily movement , bodily temperature , electrical rhythms of the body and so forth .
we can also engineer these systems , so they can integrate energy sources , and can have wireless transmission capabilities .
here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional belt .
some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition , and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context .
( laughter ) one of the things we have to remember , as i mentioned earlier , is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment .
we fell in love , got married and we came away really inspired , thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation — something that was meant to last , that could make a real difference and something that we could do together .
but now this : demand is going to go up .
and why is that ?
well , that 's because fish , first of all , float .
now think about that for a minute .
once you know , you know .
you ca n't go back .
there 's really cool stuff happening all over the globe .
now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction .
who raised it , and what did it eat ?
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
it 's a historic moment right now .
i love theater .
at that moment , we transcend space and time together .
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .
`` if antoine de saint-exupery , the author of `` '' the little prince , '' '' were here , he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside . ''
this is not a box ; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life .
technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition , live , on stage .
so today , i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology .
the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery .
and here are some excerpts .
as a street performer , i have learned that everybody wants to connect .
it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more .
zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow , tell various stories through different mediums .
the idea is simple , basic . it 's not original , but it 's important , and it 's important to participate .
it 's conceptual . it 's universal . it 's beyond words and numbers .
there is a revolution in the way that we think , in the way that we share , and the way that we express our stories , our evolution .
it is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent , meaningful and extraordinary work . it 's now .
( ringing ) thank you .
and this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals .
and i lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line , and one of my neighbors came running over .
`` `` '' the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor . '' '' i stopped walking , and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative . ''
and to think that the tumor was in the same bone , in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier — it seemed like too much of a coincidence .
they 'd just turned three , and they were into all things pink and purple .
i kept imagining all the walks i might not take with them , the art projects i might not mess up , the boyfriends i might not scowl at , the aisles i might not walk down .
so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men .
now jeff led this trip i took to europe when i graduated from high school in the early 1980s .
get off the bus . seek out what 's different .
`` approach the cow . '' '' `` `` so it 's 10 years from now , '' '' i said , `` '' and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad , and i 'm not here . ''
`` what would you tell them ? '' '' he said , `` '' i would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle . ''
and what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip .
`` i was like , `` '' david cries when you invite him to take a walk . '' '' ( laughter ) but he 's a literary agent , which means he 's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams do n't come true . ''
`` i was at a wall . '' '' he said , `` '' i do n't see the wall , '' '' and i 'm telling you the same , do n't see the wall . ''
do n't give in to the wall .
you hurry , you get where you 're going , but you get there alone .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love .
he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage , which is the least euphemistic term i 've ever heard .
`` i want you to live . '' '' i wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book , `` '' the council of dads , '' '' and i listed these lessons , a few of which you 've heard here today : approach the cow , pack your flipflops , do n't see the wall , live the questions , harvest miracles . ''
and i just want to mention briefly in passing — i 'm past my time limit — but i just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is , at a similar meeting , back in the spring , anne wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly — in a span of three weeks — put the full resources of 23andme , and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of anybody , a living person with a heart tissue , bone sarcoma .
and the epidemiologists here will tell you , that 's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states .
may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace , or find a way to get over , around , or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
so , what did you do , last time you got serious ?
after the war , you opened your markets to europe , you dragged europe into the then-global economy , which was your economy , and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade .
`` yes , you tear up the `` '' eleventh commandment '' '' — national sovereignty . ''
that is still the waterfront of effective policies : aid , trade , security , governments .
now , today i 'm going to take just one of those four .
the opportunity we 're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms .
so , a mass of new discoveries .
`` so , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science i 've done since `` '' the bottom billion , '' '' so it 's new . ''
you get more money because your terms of trade have improved , but also that drives up output across the board .
just to benchmark that threshold , it 's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s .
the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards , which will be voluntary , but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues .
so , we know it works . what would the content be of these international standards ?
there 's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that , and it 's called verified auctions .
( laughter ) when i put that to the president of sierra leone , the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions .
however , i have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me .
this is why i 'm on this stage , but it 's alarming .
`` my wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks , and the blog comment said , `` '' collier is not charismatic — ( laughter ) — but his arguments are compelling . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) if you agree with that sentiment , and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry , you will realize that i need you . ''
and that was the mythology of skill .
and since richard put me on this whole thing with music — i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab — it relates a lot to music .
well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
ok , if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights , but then hopefully even rhythm .
ok , then you 've got to combine them , because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .
( laughter ) no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who 's got his hands around that mess , ok .
all right . so , that 's one way of doing it , which is five balls down .
same pattern .
hands out in front of you . palms up , together .
index finger , middle finger , ring , little .
one learning process that i see is this — ( laughter ) ok. another learning process that i see is this — ( laughter ) ok. so , everybody take a deep breath in , breath out . ok .
now , i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer .
( laughter ) ok ? here we go .
( applause ) how did you do ? well ? ok. the reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face throughout their lives , a moment of learning , a moment of challenge .
another moment . ( rattling )
time . how can you look at time ?
and it has to settle . and then it 's dependent on something else .
now , this has expanded into a much bigger piece , because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this .
but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment .
( laughter ) hup . now , it 's dependent on rhythm , and keeping a center of balance . when it falls , going underneath .
as your skill increases , you learn to find those tinier spaces , those tinier movements . thanks .
sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with .
it 's a combination of that , the beauty of that , the shape , and the stories that were involved in it , as well as the fact that they protected the contents .
`` ( music ) ( applause ) talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half — can you run `` '' s-curve music ? '' '' i 'm going to do just a short version of it . ''
and then changing levels .
this may not be the right shape , and — look at this shape , and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it , just to see , just to play , because i love all different kinds of things to play with .
let 's see here .
now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman .
i was n't even going to mention this , but somebody told me that meg ryan might be here , and she is the world 's most famous female copulatory vocalizer .
and in exchange , women have offered fidelity , or at least a promise of fidelity .
( laughter ) that one took a minute to sink in , huh ?
so it 's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells , so it 's already a competitive environment .
that indicates female copulatory vocalization .
now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
in their society , everyone , men and women , are completely sexually autonomous .
there 's no shame associated with sexual behavior .
on the other side of the planet , in the amazon , we 've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity .
it 's time we moved beyond mars and venus , because the truth is that men are from africa and women are from africa .
nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism , but it 's not who you are .
and so you could live on mcdonald 's and milkshakes , but your body will rebel against that . we have appetites .
i think it was schopenhauer who said , a person can do what they want but not want what they want .
that 's what i 'm trying to get at .
and understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it .
the surface temperature is close to 900 degrees fahrenheit , 500 celsius .
it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's headlight .
only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom .
my models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars .
using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere .
alright .
people with spinal cord injuries , like paraplegias , quadriplegias , will often develop a very , very sensitive area right above the level of their injury , wherever that is .
and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people — a certain kind of dead person , a beating-heart cadaver .
it 's like this . you trigger the spot .
days went by .
i love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation .
did not find any evidence of upsuck .
so they came up with this five-point stimulation plan for the sows .
`` that 's not one of your five steps . '' '' i have to read you what she said , because i love it . ''
he got together in his lab 300 men , a measuring tape , and a movie camera .
however , the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark , which is impressive .
and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war , and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met .
so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that .
and we call that the meme-ome .
so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
so from this , we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection , but luckily , computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful .
eb : yeah , i mean , just to point out here , you can not get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube .
let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
now often , when we 're faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
and those algorithms , whilst being kind of useful , are also very , very narrow , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
it has mathematical structure , and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what 's being said , to see what 's not being said , and to be a little bit more human and , hopefully , a little smarter .
okay , here 's two theories about how people might think about this , and then we 'll see some data .
`` a lot of people say , `` '' i really do n't know what people are going to pick , so i think the average will be 50 . '' '' they 're not being really strategic at all . ''
`` other people who are a little more sophisticated , using more working memory , say , `` '' i think people will pick 33 because they 're going to pick a response to 50 , and so i 'll pick 22 , which is two-thirds of 33 . '' '' they 're doing one extra step of thinking , two steps . ''
that 's better . and of course , in principle , you could do three , four or more , but it starts to get very difficult .
the contest said , send in your numbers and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize .
there 's almost no difference .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
so this is the other group of subjects who often disagree .
and by the way , these were trials where their deals were made .
here 's the case where the disagreements occur .
there 's a lot more arrows .
they 're still our closest genetic kin .
wrong . ( laughter ) we can try . we 'll try . maybe we 'll try .
they want to press the opposite screen of the chimp .
so a point here is the behavior by a pair of players , one trying to match , one trying to mismatch .
and as you can see , the chimps , each chimp is one triangle , are circled around , hovering around that prediction .
and as you can see , their behavior moves up in the direction of this change in the nash equilibrium .
we have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money , and chimps are better competitors than humans , as judged by game theory .
if you think about it , using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution , because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it 's packed full of cells , so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system .
it 's almost nothing .
what i think i 've been talking about really is success and failure .
when we 're told that banking is a very respectable profession , a lot of us want to go into banking .
and it 's a very hard line to make .
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .
ah-hah .
`` `` '' the god indra has sinned , in that he has sinned against ... a brahmin . ''
there is a trend here .
and the brahmins and the gods , like in my story , always get to tell their truth as the truth .
`` you ca n't have barriers , because it breaks through your prejudices , breaks through everything that you have as your mask , that says , `` '' i am this , i am that , i am that . '' '' no . it breaks through those . ''
and all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies , and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely do n't require , they also know the power of the arts .
imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women .
so , why are n't governments blaring this on television ?
why is n't it on every poster across the third world ?
and here is one of the ways we get it to people .
man : listen , go fetch that cotton sari you have .
woman : all right , father .
woman : here , father , your eight-times folded cotton sari .
well , here is one such way .
( video ) ( laughs ) you are peaceful people .
your grandparents were peaceful people .
so much peace in one place ?
it 's what made you smack your baby brother , stamp on a cockroach , scratch your mother .
hello , gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood .
look what they 've done .
`` and of course , `` '' the vagina monologues '' '' we know about . ''
so , something has got to give . and that is what i want .
`` `` '' uh-huh ... '' '' she said . ''
i was too young , unmarried , i had no children , did n't really know africa , and besides , my french was pitiful .
i think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well , so i moved to kenya and worked in uganda , and i met a group of rwandan women , who asked me , in 1986 , to move to kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there .
`` and i did , and we ended up naming it duterimbere , meaning `` '' to go forward with enthusiasm . '' '' and while we were doing it , i realized that there were n't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women , and so maybe i should try to run a business , too . ''
and so i started looking around , and i heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes .
it 's really hard to say what you mean .
the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty .
and so , it was really those lessons that made me decide to build acumen fund about six years ago .
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise , and both of them , because they 're manufacturers , create jobs directly , and create incomes indirectly , because they 're in the malaria sector , and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .
i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago , and some of you visited a to z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in east africa .
and this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked .
one , that people will pay different prices , but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .
we can continue going along at 12 dollars a net , and the customer pays zero , or we could at least experiment with some of it , to charge one dollar a net , costing the public sector another six dollars a net , give the people the dignity of choice , and have a distribution system that might , over time , start sustaining itself .
we 've got to start having conversations like this , and i do n't think there 's any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines .
one sister who makes other people 's wishes come true .
it should n't be that difficult .
it takes opening your arms , both , wide , and expecting very little love in return , but demanding accountability , and bringing the accountability to the table as well .
today , i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
and so sometime soon , you 'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way .
most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends , and that creates a huge challenge .
how could you have a problem like this ?
after all , at least on paper , there 's this notion that these state budgets are balanced .
but even so , as you go out into those future years , various pension costs , health costs go up enough , and the revenue does not go up enough .
it perpetuates deficit spending .
and california 's not unique .
there 's ways , if it 's temporary , to minimize the impact , but it 's a problem .
there 's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness , measuring them , giving them feedback , taking videos in the classroom .
that 's something i think is very , very important .
the amount of iq in good numeric analysis , both inside google and microsoft and outside , with analysts and people of various opinions — should they have spent on that ?
we need better tools .
( applause )
now i know we learned that in math class , but now it 's everywhere in the culture — the x prize , the x-files , project x , tedx .
this includes the little system in arabic called al-jebra .
a father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk , to get home , finish their schoolwork , and prepare themselves for bed .
`` and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — `` '' bam , bam ! '' '' — killing the father . ''
`` that 's the shooter i saw that killed the father . '' '' that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to , to bind mr. carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder . ''
we know that eyewitness identifications are fallible .
but it happens without awareness such that you do n't , are n't even cognizant of it occurring .
it happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources , and that 's where i go out and i do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers , with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception , along with special cameras and high-speed film , right ?
take all the measurements and record them , right ?
the teenagers said they could see very well .
as you can see , it is at best poor .
their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
which means there would be very little resolution , what we call boundary or edge detection , and that furthermore , because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light , the depth of field , the distance at which you can focus and see details , would have been less than 18 inches away .
`` with a black object and point it right at you , and you can look at it as long as you want . '' '' and that 's what he saw . ( laughter ) you 'll notice , which was also in my test report , all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side , which means that the shooter 's face would have been photo-occluded . it would have been backlit . ''
i could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert of just trying to get science into the courtroom .
they 're dynamic .
they 're malleable . they 're volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they 're correct .
but then one day , everything changed .
it made her scared and it made her doubt .
he had seven broken ribs , shattered hip bones , and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain .
that calls for total transparency in medicine .
then , we go one step further .
we believe that transparency can be the cure for fear .
my friends and family urged me to quit this campaign .
we ca n't sustain suburbs , so let 's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit .
it was the cultural revolution .
it 's permeable .
thank you .
they are becoming more compressed and more threatened .
as we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth , i 've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand .
you ca n't love something and become a champion for it if you do n't know it exists .
uncovering this — that is the power of conservation photography .
close behind are sharks .
without dolphins , the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what i call a sardine donut , or a mouth full of water .
now , while i 've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run , i know they do n't see me as prey .
very few people have heard of bassas da india , a tiny speck of coral in the mozambique channel .
i had a bit of a hunch that they 'd be even bolder and more abundant at night .
earlier this year , i was on assignment for national geographic magazine in baja california .
now , on the other side of the peninsula lies cabo pulmo , a sleepy fishing village .
but what happened next was nothing short of miraculous .
but then , all of that suddenly changed on february 23 , 1997 , when my little brother matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the empire state building .
let 's look , for example , at people who love to hunt , a sport enjoyed by millions across the us .
it 's a proud tradition . families .
well , they want to hunt . they love their guns .
in fact , there 's a lot of it , starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands .
but what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across america ?
i kind of hate to say it , because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising , which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times , eventually that lie becomes the truth .
and if you want proof , let 's start where most conversations in the us seem to start — with kim kardashian .
we 're flipping that narrative on its head .
after that recent terrible tragedy in san bernardino , we jammed congressional switchboards .
the stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken .
they do n't go all the way , but they are going to save lives , because they expand brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that did n't have them previously .
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .
so you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
really what we want to hear is music .
and we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out , how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air ?
now if you had to pick a sense to lose , i have to be very honest with you and say , we 're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is .
i 'm not saying that they ca n't live a beautiful , wonderful life .
girl : i just take off my ci , and i do n't hear anything .
jn : so you do n't want to hear everything that 's out there ?
i mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it 's abstract .
the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
because i always view music as the pinnacle of hearing .
( music ) now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation .
but it certainly was n't the way the music was intended .
( trumpet ) the trumpet .
cochlear implant users can not tell the difference between these instruments .
i 've been very lucky to work with dr. david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants .
( music ) text : beethoven does n't excite her . ( music )
cl : now i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it .
but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they were n't very helpful .
and it was absolutely wonderful .
you do n't actually have to hear it .
and so there is certainly a lot of hope , but there 's a lot more that needs to be done .
but i tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
and i do n't think that we should give up on beauty .
there 's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them .
i know firsthand .
but it all starts with the c.o.s .
they play the little high school kid games with each other .
he pulled me there because i had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit , and he felt , since there was a female officer working on the floor , that i violated his shift .
i was n't impulsive , i did n't react right away , because i know this is their house .
a second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming .
and aside from that , i wrote music and short stories .
`` i said , `` '' all right , i see an airplane . '' '' he said , `` '' exactly , and what 's on that airplane ? '' '' `` `` people . '' '' `` exactly . now where 's that plane and those people going ? '' ''
about seven years ago , they faced extinction , because israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
through inspired local leadership , they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
here in budrus , we realized the wall would steal our land .
israeli activist : nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
but i think the girls could do it .
fatah , hamas and the popular front !
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit .
the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior , since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it .
but that 's true for adults too .
so we organized a screening .
on the israeli side , there is a new peace movement called solidariot , which means solidarity in hebrew .
the examples of wallajeh and the solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior .
( applause )
the humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century .
tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers were scouring the internet , converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open-source maps , layering them with all sorts of important information — people like crisis mappers and open street map — and putting these on the web for everybody — the media , the aid organizations and the communities themselves — to participate in and to use .
never having been confronted with this type of situation before , we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource , how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and sms technology .
we had basically three requirements .
it 's on the outskirts of nairobi , the capital city of kenya .
they have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible .
you can find out about places of worship .
they also have their own news network on youtube with 36,000 viewers at the moment .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile subscriptions .
we need to , for example , embrace the big data , the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data .
the possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations , not only ensure that people 's right to information is met , or that they have their right to communicate , but i think in the future , humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard , that they 're truly participating , that they 're truly empowered in the humanitarian world .
i believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital .
i extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices — generally anything i can find in the hardware store .
that begins my translation process .
a basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
when i assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , i can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form .
every colored bead , every colored string , represents a weather element .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
i also translate weather data into musical scores .
and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it .
this is the 1913 trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum .
and not everyone has a ph.d. in science .
i 'm working on my phd at smu , trying to understand peru 's geothermal energy potential , when i remember this legend , and i began asking that question .
`` telling this same story at a family dinner , my aunt tells me , `` but no , andrés , i 've been there . i 've swum in that river . '' ''
and this is what 's bizarre — it starts off as a cold stream .
and here we find a hot spring , mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life .
they drink its water .
then , to my tremendous relief — i was freaking out , to be honest with you — a smile began to snake across his face , and he just laughed .
surprise !
`` not only that , the indigenous name of the river , shanay-timpishka , `` boiled with the heat of the sun , '' indicating that i 'm not the first to wonder why the river boils , and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us . ''
it flows hot for 6.24 kilometers .
and the results were just awesome .
it then heats up , cools back down , heats up , cools back down , heats up again , and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river .
we took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures .
but again , despite all of these studies , all of these discoveries and the legends , a question remains : what is the significance of the boiling river ?
what is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle ?
and what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend ?
we are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial .
so go out .
because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle , where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life .
a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
17 million people die every year from heart disease .
this is what 's going on .
these are just for information : hypertension , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise . the usual suspects .
right here in tanzania , 30 percent of individuals have hypertension .
if we can treat hypertension alone in africa , we 'll save 250,000 lives a year . that 's quite significant !
post-9/11 , [ the ] united states has had a lot of trouble to deal with , their own internal issues .
you ca n't rightly — it 's not their responsibility , it is my responsibility . i have to take care of my own problems .
[ it 's ] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures .
all the units , all the centers , are linked through a switched hub to a central server , and all the images are populated to review stations .
we also use [ an ] electronic medical record system .
and everyone will get the care they deserve .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
indirectly , we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care .
`` people say , `` '' how can you do that ? '' '' this is how we can do that . ''
that way we 're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues .
there 's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training i received here , and i think there 's been an increased interest now in — particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting .
who are we to decide that poor people can not get the best care ?
he taught me to never presume anything about anyone you do n't know .
i mean — he did n't know me .
it allowed him to push that button .
in the time it takes to draw a breath , we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible ; what i imagine wading through tar might be like .
we were helping each other .
we were calling out our names , a little bit like a roll call , waiting for responses .
`` ok. '' '' `` '' i 'm gill . ''
alive .
i drank gin and i watched ted talks , of course , never dreaming that one day i would be standing , balancing on prosthetic legs , giving a talk .
i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and i just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
and he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that .
this was the one chance that i had to focus on what i , really , was after , and what was important . and to my surprise , i realized the importance of environmental issues , which charles lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to , and preparing that paper did me a lot of good .
and this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates .
i give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer , and ask them , after they 've asked me questions , and i give them a talk and so on . then i ask them questions .
what 's the population of the earth ?
as time went on , we stopped our environmental programs .
and we developed the impact car that general motors made , the ev1 , out of — and got the air resources board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars , but they 've since come apart .
i have a helios . we have the first video .
( music ) her designers ' attention to detail and her construction gives helios ' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere .
it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .
with on-board gps , it can navigate autonomously , and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage .
( music ) i 've never seen anything like that .
how old were you when you invented that ?
tm : oh , 10 , 11 . ( aa : oh my god . ) tm : 12 , something like that . ( aa : that 's amazing . ) pm : and tyler 's here to show you the walkalong .
as the wind comes up , it has to go over the cliff , so as you walk through the air , it goes around your body , some has to go over you .
so let me try to illustrate their findings with an example .
you now walk the same path as these early artists .
it 's one of the things i find most fascinating about studying our deep history .
before i could even get started on my questions , my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites .
over the course of two years , my faithful husband dylan and i each spent over 300 hours underground , hiking , crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in france , spain , portugal and sicily .
some signs start out strong , before losing popularity and vanishing , while other signs are later inventions .
so back to the matter at hand .
there could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators , like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures from la roque de venasque in france .
and it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing , and most certainly our lives , our businesses and the lives of our children .
it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer .
typically , because we can create products very rapidly , it 's been used by product designers , or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design .
and actually what 's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse .
again , not buildable in any other way .
you 're having machines fabricate themselves .
and also , you can engage in shape manipulation of that product , but within boundaries that are safe .
because obviously the public are not professional product designers .
i do n't think that will happen soon .
scanning teeth today , you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you .
but with mri data , we can just build the product , as you can see , very intricately .
we like different things .
we 're all different sizes and our companies the same .
`` ( laughter ) she said , `` '' be good to your friends . ''
let 's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together .
now you 've got to picture aunt zip at 105 years old in sodom , north carolina .
down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule .
`` and we 'd sing this old song . she did n't have a whole lot of energy , so i 'd sing , `` '' hey , hey ! '' '' and she 'd just answer back with , `` '' black-eyed susie . '' '' oh , hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! ''
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
hey , hey , hey , hey . hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey !
i fell in love with that .
i went up to him and said , how can i learn that ?
i just fell in love with the culture and the people .
just a few of them , but maybe you 'll get just a little hint of some of these folks .
and play a little banjo . let 's do a little medley .
he was one of the great american folk tale-tellers .
they were known both far and wide .
when the yankees saw them coming , they 'd lay down their guns and hide .
and , buddy , that made us mad .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
and if you do n't know what you 're doing , your hands are bleeding in no time .
`` do n't want it to leave me behind . '' '' and from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : `` '' good news , good news : chariot 's coming . ''
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can .
do n't want it to leave me behind .
good news : chariot 's coming . good news : chariot 's coming .
it 's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton , is n't it ?
there 's a starry crown in heaven , i know .
it 's usually played flat on your lap .
that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .
and for me , the sound of a steel guitar , because one of my parents ' neighbors just gave me one of these things .
and it was the only instrument that , of all the ones that i play , that would really make that connection .
michael 's dad was working on something called the computer .
it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see : sulfur , potassium nitrate and charcoal .
they said they were going to beat us up if we did n't make some gunpowder for them .
it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down .
michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen .
no hair , no eyelashes , no nothing .
there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet ; the air was the just full of black smoke .
because of the coup d'état , my family had to leave my native home of ghana and move to the gambia .
then , at the age of eight , we moved to botswana .
everywhere i went , i experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people , and at the time , i realized that i wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great .
`` i think the economy needs a stimulus . '' '' the central bank governor will think you 're crazy . ''
`` you call the central bank governor and you say , `` please double the money supply . '' ''
the good news is that most of these leaders have moved on , and they were replaced by generation three .
now these leaders are by no means perfect , but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two .
so these leaders are by no means perfect , but they are by and large the best leaders we 've seen in the last 50 years .
the first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent .
laetitia 's a young woman from kenya who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school because her family could n't afford to pay fees for her .
and she 's just turned 18 .
so today , i 'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the african leadership academy .
`` you can be that great generation . '' '' i believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of african leaders , then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen . ''
and you can go to any emergency room at any hospital , and you would see lying on gurneys young black and latino men shot and dying .
i was doing funerals of 18-year-olds , 17-year-olds , and 16-year-olds , and i was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
rap music ?
after about two weeks of volunteering at the high school , i realized that the youth that i was trying to reach , they were n't going to high school .
( laughter ) ( applause ) all right , come on , you 're cutting into my time now , okay ? ( laughter ) but it was amazing .
you are the subject matter experts , if you will , of that period of time .
and we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and magnificent and wise people that we 've ever met were on the street , engaged in a struggle .
and i know some of them call it survival , but i call them overcomers , because when you 're in the conditions that they 're in , to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming .
we had other partners .
it 's all connected , and one of the wonderful things that we 've been able to do is to be able to show the value of partnering together — community , law enforcement , private sector , the city — in order to reduce violence .
i really want to see some twentysomethings here .
it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex .
thank you .
it was less than a year after september 11 , and i was at the chicago tribune writing about shootings and murders , and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed .
police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
my charges were dismissed , but a few weeks later , two fbi agents knocked on my door , and they told me that unless i helped them by spying on protest groups , they would put me on a domestic terrorist list .
the point of all of this is to make us afraid , but as a journalist , i have an unwavering faith in the power of education .
our best weapon is sunlight .
there was music playing on this day , i think it was madonna 's greatest hits . ( laughter ) and there was plenty of conversation , not just about the patient 's heart rate , but about sports and weekend plans .
and since then , the more surgeries i watched , the more i realized this is how it is .
and then inserts these long , thin instruments and a camera , and actually does the procedure inside the patient .
( laughter ) remember this ?
every single time you did this , you experienced the same fundamental physics that i was watching in the operating room that day .
let 's go back to drilling through a wall .
but right at the moment of puncture , the tissue ca n't push back on the tip anymore .
the truth is that 's not always the case .
now , 20 years on , at ted , i want to ask your help in a new reframing .
so that , in all that diversity , if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this , everything i looked into , i had to connect to some new machine , i had to learn to run some new program , i would find the information i wanted in some new data format .
so if you just imagined them all being part of some big , virtual documentation system in the sky , say on the internet , then life would be so much easier .
that 's what it was like then .
they 're much more than we 'd originally imagined when we put together the little , initial website that we started off with .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
because data you ca n't naturally use by itself but in fact , data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it .
`` and hans made a point of saying , `` '' look , it 's really important to have a lot of data . '' '' and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , `` '' it 's really important to have a lot of data . '' '' so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected , or six like he did , but i want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data . ''
`` if you want to put something on the web there are three rules : first thing is that those http names — those things that start with `` '' http : '' '' — we 're using them not just for documents now , we 're using them for things that the documents are about . ''
so the second rule is i get important information back .
data is relationships .
so i can browse this stuff .
so that 's it , really .
the idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that hans had , and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting .
it 's not just a root supplying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is — a presentation , an analysis , somebody 's looking for patterns in the data — they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is .
so he wrote a program to take the data , extract it from wikipedia , and put it into a blob of linked data on the web , which he called dbpedia .
that 's important . why is it important ?
not just for transparency , yeah transparency in government is important , but that data — this is the data from all the government departments think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in america .
audience : raw .
`` tim berners-lee : can you say `` '' data '' '' ? ''
audience : data .
audience : now !
the people who are going to solve those — the scientists — they have half-formed ideas in their head , they try to communicate those over the web .
in fact , i 'll just go into one area — if you 're looking at alzheimer 's , for example , drug discovery — there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
every time you do things on the social networking site , the social networking site is taking data and using it — re-purposing it — and using it to make other people 's lives more interesting on the site .
that 's how linked data works .
so , linked data — it 's huge .
`` bassem was also struggling in egypt , and he said to doaa , `` '' let 's go to europe ; seek asylum , safety . ''
and doaa was terrified of the water .
`` they asked the captain , `` '' when will we get there ? '' '' he told them to shut up , and he insulted them . ''
`` he was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat , and he said to them , `` '' i fear i am not going to survive . ''
even if they wanted to return , they ca n't .
this is a unesco world heritage city , homs , in syria .
so people continue to flee into neighboring countries , and we build refugee camps for them in the desert .
and days have turned into months , months into years .
this was the little girl i showed you in the picture earlier , with the life vests .
it was very frightening .
`` when doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned , she said to the sobbing child , `` she just went away to find you water and food . '' ''
and she waved her arms , hoping they would see her , but the planes were soon gone .
there was never an international investigation into what happened .
my colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in arabic .
`` `` '' doaa , do you know what happened to my brother ? ''
soon , we hope , masa will be reunited with him in sweden , and until then , she 's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in athens .
why could n't masa have taken an airplane to sweden ?
people are worried about their security , their economies , the changes of culture .
now , with that in mind , was your quiznos sandwich awesome ?
pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone .
d-day , june 6 , 1944 , the allied invasion of normandy , the largest amphibious invasion in world history .
it 's just like that .
but it 's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower , although that would be awesome .
( laughter ) bees are awesome . are you kidding me ?
( laughter ) that 's one small step for a man , one giant leap for awesome !
you ca n't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
`` jimi hendrix 's version of `` '' the star-spangled banner '' '' was the most iconic . ''
and we wanted to call our pediatrician , but we also did n't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy , neurotic parent .
he was excited , and he was inclined to accept the offer .
now , the first thing we need to know is : what is my range ?
but what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind , it 's a really a low-power double bind .
so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior .
when they advocate for others , they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind .
one of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking .
when i take your perspective , and i think about what you really want , you 're more likely to give me what i really want .
and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible .
she took a step back .
well , one of the ways is be a mama bear .
when we ask others for advice , they like us because we flatter them , and we 're expressing humility .
two , i 've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice .
i smiled .
`` i leaned in . '' '' when we tap into our passion , we give ourselves the courage , in our own eyes , to speak up , but we also get the permission from others to speak up . ''
tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak .
have excellent evidence and strong allies .

i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains .
and with the help of skype , that is what we are going to attempt today .
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
thank you .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption — up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
beyond cities , all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects .
and the plastic bottle we 're throwing away every day still stays there .
you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
that 's , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
( music ) so imagine one helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchrony .
you see on the left the pixels , the different resolutions being captured .
it 's both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture .
and where it has led in origami is to things like this .
this is an origami figure — one sheet , no cuts , folding only , hundreds of folds .
the secret to productivity in so many fields — and in origami — is letting dead people do your work for you .
if you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line , all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
`` i mean , a stag beetle — it 's got two points for jaws , it 's got antennae . can you be that specific in the detail ? '' '' and yeah , you really can . ''
so how do we do that ? well , we break it down into a few smaller steps .
and then once i have that folded shape that we call the base , you can make the legs narrower , you can bend them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
but we 're going to start small .
there 's other ways of making flaps .
so , no matter how i make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
what do i need ? i need a lot of circles .
i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .
so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles , you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules . that gives you the folds .
( laughter ) it 's so simple that a computer could do it .
it folds in thirds . it 's a very simple pattern — you would n't even call that origami .
how do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?
but this is a five-meter telescope — has about a quarter-mile focal length .
now , there is other origami in space .
and the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation .
well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
the airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects — things with legs .
thanks .
( applause )
( laughter ) they sell glasses online .
they 're the people you want to bet on .
and they look nothing like i expected .
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are .
( laughter ) and then i worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal .
take leonardo da vinci .
`` when they were dragging their heels for six months , i looked at them and said , `` you know , a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online . '' ''
it leads you to freeze .
but idea doubt is energizing .
and if you do that well , you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu .
but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
no . you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb .
why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times ?
now , you may be wondering , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
so if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
they have bad ideas .
and sometimes , it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed .
do n't write them off .
( applause )
i 'm dr. david hanson , and i build robots with character .
there he 's starting to walk .
this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology .
they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions , what facial expressions you 're making .
( laughter ) now i 'm frowning .
oh , it 's so sad .
this might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
and due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
now damien knows all about condoms , but he does n't sell them .
it 's not surprising , because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms .
and as a marketer , i found that curious .
we offer a two-year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education .
ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing , with the ethiopic script that was developed in the fourth century a.d .
the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa , which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children .
so , unsignalized intersections , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there 's an excessive proliferation of them .
they 're expensive to install , but they are more expensive not to . so , we should look at that .
that intersection i looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction , and so that 's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .
when people come to an unfamiliar situation they do n't know how to deal with they slow down .
we 've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , many treatments for cancer , antiretrovirals for hiv , statins for heart disease and much more .
but by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you .
today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , alzheimer 's is the only one we can not prevent , cure or even slow down .
as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer 's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
for almost a century , we did n't know much about these .
you can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami .
we have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
so if someone were to actually sneeze , that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter .
it actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics , what we 're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane .
instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns , we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones .
and in short , with this system , we win .
together , we can build the future today .
so it started over here .
`` `` where were you the 11th ? '' `` where were you the 10th ? '' ''
furniture that i ca n't fit in my ratty apartment .
`` just assorted garage sale junk , because i 'm a pack rat . '' '' and he looks at me really confused and says , `` '' no explosives ? '' '' ( laughter ) i was like , `` '' no , no . i 'm pretty certain there were no explosives . ''
i work at a university .
`` i would tell them , `` '' hey guys , this is where i 'm going . this is my flight . ''
`` just wanted to say , `` '' hey guys . ''
`` do n't want to make it look like i 'm making any sudden moves . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i do n't want you guys to think that i 'm about to flee . ''
`` at the time that this was going on , the last thing on my mind was `` '' art project . '' '' i was certainly not thinking , hey , i got new work here . ''
this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch 99 in daly city on sunday , november 15th .
and i bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville .
and then my pickled jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route 18 in east brunswick .
and i can tell you exactly who i was with , where i was , because this is what i had to do with the fbi .
so there 's multiple databases .
so you get something like this .
these are some of the meals that i 've been cooking at home .
so how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
at 11:39 a.m. was this one .
at 1:56 p.m. was this one . at 4:59 p.m. was this one .
it 's actually quite user-unfriendly .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
not really sure why they show up , but they do .
( applause ) bruno giussani : hasan , just curious .
so it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it 's done .
`` and there was a huge row online about , `` '' hey , this ca n't be real . '' '' and so i waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech . ''
dimitri , just waggle your arm around .
so , he 's discovering the garden .
the other thing to use is your body .
you order an airline ticket ; you end up in timbuktu .
peter molyneux : what are you going to do , dimitri ?
dimitri : go on , milo . squash it .
pm : no . that 's the wrong thing to do .
you stand up , and you skim the stone .
try hitting the boat .
pm : that 's dimitri at his most competitive .
now beaten an 11-year-old child . well done .
we 're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part , you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo .
dimitri : well , you 've got a new school to go to .
this looks nice .
then i have been walking east for 20 years — from eastern europe to central asia — through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
and i ever met more humble people .
and i shared their bread and their prayer .
and their love [ for studying ] was so big that i cried .
( applause )
you can see its generation has declined seven percent over the last 10 years .
but the data says something different .
when you combine all the electricity from solar and wind , you see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear .
i would get one at home in berkeley .
the presentations were all very exciting and very promising ; they have multiple reactors that they 're working on .
there 's a reactor that 's coming online now , they 're starting to sell it .
it ca n't melt down .
let 's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs .
the media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their muslim communities , but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own 30-mosque journey .
`` and as `` '' these birds walk '' '' played at film festivals and theaters internationally , i finally had my feet planted at home in new york , and with all the extra time and still no real money , my wife tasked me to cook more for us . ''
so , with emotions running high , and absolutely no experience in butchery , some friends and i opened a meat store in the heart of the east village fashion district .
i 'll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends . i 'll never forget the sound
and then i had to quickly learn international policy , because i was asked to work on the un convention that protects people with disabilities .
as the leader of the ngo there , i spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
fourth , prototyping : gathering whatever you can , whatever you can find , to mimic your solution , to test it and to refine it .
and i could n't hear this sound .
the second is : i was deaf .
as you see , when we design for disability first , we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive , but also are often better than when we design for the norm .
they would just get frustrated with you .
years later , someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it .
so as you can see , i 've been a design thinker for nearly all my life .
this is something that designers also have to deal with frequently .
but they came with pre-determined solutions .
you are a designer — everyone is .
let people with disabilities help you look sideways , and in the process , solve some of the greatest problems .
`` and restructured the whole thing , including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place `` '' the battle of anghiari '' '' on a specific area of one of the two walls . ''
well , we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind .
and we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see , like this .
well , we believe , again , that this should be the beginning , the very first step , to do real conservation , and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation , the technique , materials , and also if , when , and why we should restore , or , rather , to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting .
well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .
and if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we 're trying to do .
we 're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
i really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me , who 's sort of a darwin wannabe , how they actually look at one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine .
you actually see a great potential , but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf , and may actually be very resistant , when one tries to introduce ideas .
the whole point is that a person who ca n't move can still infect many other individuals .
so , one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria , and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water , tend to be more harmful .
remember the second question that i raised at the outset was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild ?
but if it could occur in just a few years , then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we have n't been able to control .
and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera .
it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen , the internal chamber of our intestine , and then that fluid goes the only way it can , which is out the other end .
just to emphasize this , this is what we 're really talking about .
now , i do n't know how that happened , and i did n't have anything to do with it , i promise you .
so , this is very encouraging , it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow , if we had enough money , could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck .
so , we can go to the same countries and look and see .
if you mosquito-proof houses , when people get sick , they 're sitting in bed — or in mosquito-proof hospitals , they 're sitting in a hospital bed — and the mosquitoes ca n't get to them .
and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there , in northern alabama , by the tennessee valley authority .
ok , so the tennessee valley authority was in a little bit of a bind .
so they did . they divided northern alabama into 11 zones , and within three years , about 100 dollars per house , they mosquito proofed every house .
and so it 's a short-term solution .
this is a long-term solution .
so , this table i 've given just to emphasize that i 've only talked about two examples .
what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work .
now , i do n't know about you , but i do n't buy that .
`` i think we really lucked out here . something is happening . '' '' and i ask him , `` '' really ? how do you know that , ehud ? '' '' and he says , `` '' well , i feel so terrible inside . ''
and again , the same story .
( laughter ) and so — yeah , i know .
`` where is it ? '' '' and the pet scans here are showing you very clearly where are these hot spots , where is the tumor . ''
now , if that seemed to you like a very large number , it is a very large number .
what you 're looking at here is an image of a mouse 's brain , and we 've implanted into this mouse 's brain a small little tumor .
so this is clearly very nice , but what i really want to share with you is where i think we 're heading from here .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it , hiv .
so i have a couple of really important questions for you .
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .
nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address — as we 've seen in the case of hiv .
and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals , but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis .
they show us filter paper they 've used to collect the animals ' blood .
it 's one that i think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here .
now this is the individual — you can see just right up over his right shoulder — this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you .
i like to show this shot — this is ubald tamoufe , who 's the lead investigator in our cameroon site .
ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you ca n't see his face .
this was our laboratory before .
and here 's a shot of me , this is the before shot of me .
( laughter ) no comment .
needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
that 's no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
so it 's not just hunters in central africa .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us .
i 'm going tell you right now : please do n't despair .
and yet finally , we have the tools , which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
it 's just a big blue surface .
i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i 'd love to hide as a kid , if i could only breathe underwater .
and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it , and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born .
every time i 'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board , i 'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that 's what a dinosaur looks like .
so you have living dinosaurs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman 's x-ray vision .
( laughter ) he ca n't spin a web anytime ; he 's got to pull his pants down first . ( laughter )
or take this swordfish .
imagine trying to make friends covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs .
it 's not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
so we start off the story with ernest , who volunteers as a census taker .
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
and i felt like , since my main character was a shark , the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this .
and then he dies .
so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one .
( applause ) thanks .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you ca n't see anything .
as a pediatrician , as a geneticist , as a researcher , we try and address that question .
or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism , simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply did n't have that label ?
( applause ) in fact , the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent .
just as autism is a spectrum , there 's a spectrum of etiologies , a spectrum of causes .
that is , that it is one single , powerful , deterministic gene that causes the autism .
and the reason is because in certain individuals , they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father , but actually start brand new in them , mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family .
although there are that many genes , there is some method to the madness .
they fit together in a network that 's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions .
instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection , looking at the mouth , looking at the nose , looking off in another direction , but not again socially connecting , and being able to do this on a very large scale , screen infants , screen children for autism , through something very robust , very reliable , is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact .
they absorb their surroundings in a different way , and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best .
so , i decided to investigate .
i know a woman who 's good at this .
and a friend of mine , april , who i 've had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their chores .
i want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
what do you need to hear ? go home to your wife — go ask her , what does she need ?
and thank you for being here , just showing up and changing the world with your ideas .
a month ago today i stood there : 90 degrees south , the top of the bottom of the world , the geographic south pole .
it 's going to be 40 below , every single day .
it began a little less than two years ago .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter thum , who inspired me with his actions .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blogging , telling stories of , you know , depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
the website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication .
i 'm learning this at 40 years of age .
thank you very much . thank you .
( applause ) so there is among many people — certainly me and most of the people i talk to — a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working , with the way our institutions run .
instead , all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime .
but what we believe , and what we argue in the book , is that there is no set of rules , no matter how detailed , no matter how specific , no matter how carefully monitored and enforced , there is no set of rules that will get us what we need .
well if you think about it , it 's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler .
so what do they do ?
dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass .
and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding .
so i 'll give you an example of wise practice in action .
he had a pretty low-wage job .
he was supporting his wife and a child , and the child was going to parochial school .
one night , he drank a little too much , and he robbed a cab driver — stole 50 dollars .
and so she improvised a sentence — 11 months , and not only that , but release every day to go to work .
and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery .
second , do n't waste your time on kids who ca n't pass the test no matter what you do .
psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years .
if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures — which is the current system — they would do more .
he was married , he had a third kid on the way , he suffered from ptsd , in addition to the bad back , and recurrent nightmares , and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms .
no one wanted non-violent offenders — and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot — to be thrown into prison .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record .
love : managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part .
it 's not the ritz-carlton . it 's a jail !
and this is n't only happening in amusement parks .
you can pay them a certain amount of money , they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes , and the lobbyist , just before the hearing begins , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room .
we 've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
one of them has to do with inequality .
that 's one reason to worry .
in new york , in chicago , in washington , d.c. , they 've tried this , offering 50 dollars for an a , 35 dollars for a b .
first , how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work ? raise your hand .
you 'd measure how many — el : how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
( laughter ) but the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?
it will work the same either way .
in fact , during the past three decades , when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige , our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out , empty of larger moral meaning .
we live and work and shop and play in different places .
this is n't good for democracy , nor is it a satisfying way to live , even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line .
do we want a society where everything is up for sale , or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money can not buy ?
thank you very much .
this is slave labor to my own project .
but there is another world .
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there 's major inefficiencies , energy consumption and excessive labor techniques .
if anything changes — if the environment changes , the ground moves , or demand changes — we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them .
so in one-dimensional systems — this is a project called the self-folding proteins .
and the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein — in this case it 's the crambin protein — you take the backbone — so no cross-linking , no environmental interactions — and you break that down into a series of components .
and this gives us a tangible model of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry .
they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched .
this is the polio virus .
you shake it hard and it breaks apart .
and this is like robotics without wires or motors .
imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate , or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves .
so this is n't expensive pumps or valves .
this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way , that less might actually equal more .
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities — save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today .
yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
fortunately , more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology .
fully 50 percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they 're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form .
there were a lot of them .
and here 's lincoln meadow before selective logging .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
i want to end with a story told by a beaver .
and one afternoon , while he was recording , there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game wardens , who for no apparent reason , walked over to the beaver dam , dropped a stick of dynamite down it , blowing it up , killing the female and her young babies .
horrified , my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon , and that evening , he captured a remarkable event : the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring .
but you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world .
so , that 's home really .
i study fish , also the bigger things , whales and dolphins .
one of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region .
it 's probably the best place in the world to see them .
so it comes from the southwest . it 's a southwest monsoon .
they lay the eggs into fresh water .
something like this , these are all this species globe skimmer .
and i did n't think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
average height , about that much above sea level .
there are no ponds , streams , rivers , lakes , nothing like that .
i got a little bit curious . in fact i 'll stop here , because i want to ask , and there is a lot of people who , from india of course , people who grew up spending your childhood here .
it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout south asia , including the maldives .
and i got a bit curious about it .
but in maldives , no fresh water . so , what on earth is going on ?
and the first thing i did was started recording when they turned up in the maldives .
but wind is , invariably , every time , is from the west .
in bangalore , a colleague there sent me information for three years , average , 24th of september , so late september .
i did n't know .
so , i started a very rigorous scientific process .
i got on my bicycle , and i cycled around the island of malé .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
i can be in the southwest monsoon .
but the wind above is from the northeast monsoon .
so , the dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon , but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air . incredible .
it does n't make sense . there is nothing for them in maldives .
and i know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .
and we 're starting in june . so this is the monsoon rain .
they 're looking for somewhere to breed . if it rains here they 'll breed .
they 'll hatch out in six weeks . by that time the seasonal rains have moved on . it 's not there , it 's down here .
the rain occurs , these are summer rains .
this is a summer monsoon .
there 's a convergence . so , wherever the rain is falling , the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that 's rising .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
but it 's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter .
it 's known about the amur falcon . this guy , unfortunately , one of these met an unfortunate end .
and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from india to east africa eats insects , large insects , the size of dragonflies . thank you very much .
( applause )
and it 's great , there 's good people everywhere .
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in — were they feeling they were late , or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about .
that is to say , if we attend to the other person , we automatically empathize , we automatically feel with them .
`` there are these newly identified neurons , mirror neurons , that act like a neuro wi-fi , activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs . we feel `` '' with '' '' automatically . ''
and i think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption , to noticing , to empathy and to compassion .
and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle .
`` the word is `` '' pizzled '' '' : it 's a combination of puzzled and pissed off . ''
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there 's another person .
in a sense , the room itself is the elephant in the room , but we do n't see it . and we 've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere . consider this .
there 's a company , bennett and company , that supplies polo.com , victoria 's secret — they , because of their ceo , who 's aware of this , in china formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater .
and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man slumped to the side , shirtless , not moving , and people were just stepping over him — hundreds and hundreds of people .
( applause )
so i want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view , and this world i 'm going to talk about is the micro world .
so that 's just the eye of the bee with a microscope , and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia , and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they 're right up close to something , because they ca n't see in stereo .
a human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see .
so this whole world , the nano world , this area in here is called the nano world , and the nano world , the whole micro world that we see , there 's a nano world that is wrapped up within that , and the whole — and that is the world of molecules and atoms .
so that 's thousands of little grains of pollen there , and there 's the pistil there , and these are the little things called trichomes . and that 's what makes the flower give a fragrance , and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances .
you have bits of a volcano . there 's a little bit of a volcano there . you have tube worms .
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
so when i first looked at this , i was — i thought , gee , this is like a little treasure trove here .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
now , the way my microscopes work is , normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time , so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope , keep taking pictures , and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like , and i do that in 3d . so there , you can see , is a left-eye view . there 's a right-eye view .
and you can see here that that is — that 's sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old , and it 's never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water and tumbling , air , and so forth . all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun , has these solar storms , and that 's erosion by solar radiation .
but so , curious , i run up to the child — of course scaring the living bejesus out of him — grab him by the collar , turn it over , and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater .
i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be .
so , i 'm going to stick in rwanda , circa 1985 , 1986 , where i was doing two things .
`` we were called the `` '' bad news bears , '' '' and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in kigali , which was not hard because there were no snacks before us . ''
it 's thrilling .
they typically pay for critical goods and services like water , like healthcare , like housing , and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay — certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar .
what he did was see what was happening in israel , larger approaches , and figure out how to do a drip irrigation , which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock .
but previously it 's only been created for large-scale farms , so ami tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre .
make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor .
a couple of years later , i meet them .
a lot of hurdles .
one : production is too low . two : price is too high .
three : this is a good road in — right near where our factory is located .
distribution is a nightmare , but not impossible .
here are just some pictures of the factory .
it contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of tanzania .
the throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets , three million by the end of the year .
we 're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa : people .
first , she talked about comfort , status , beauty .
it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that , you never see it as anything else again .
here is my well-loved iphone .
thank you very much .
you see , what happens is , when we need to make complex choices , us humans like really simple solutions , and so we often ask for simple solutions .
you see , there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power , displacing the need for fossil fuel power , but we need to be smart about this .
`` because right now , what people do is they turn around and they say , `` '' let 's ban plastic bags . we 'll give people paper because that is better for the environment . '' '' but if you 're throwing it in the bin , and your local landfill facility is just a normal one , then we 're having what 's called a double negative . ''
that 's the latest u.n. stats . up to half of the food .
the drawer that you put your lettuces in ?
you need , like , an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally .
because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system , not only do we have that impact i just explained at the end of life , but we actually have had to grow that lettuce .
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
so they 're very popular .
`` or , `` '' how do i make it green materials ? ''
it 's with how people use the product .
all of this extra water that 's being boiled requires energy , and it 's been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in england for a night .
he has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody 's homes .
every single year , 1.5 billion mobile phones roll off production lines , and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate .
there 's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things , so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly , because this is otherwise what happens .
we heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the tesla motors car today .
by identifying alternative ways of doing things , we can actually start to innovate , and i say actually start to innovate .
and i 'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who i work with , a senior designer .
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
you ever thought about that ?
we lament the existence of human smugglers , and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in europe .
so the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the second world war by these guys .
its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails , or worse , turns against its own people , people have somewhere to go , to live in safety and dignity until they can go home .
so i want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works .
how does the refugee regime actually work ?
so imagine a syrian woman .
amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country , and it 's that which we 're seeing in europe today .
around the world , we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options : encampment , urban destitution and dangerous journeys .
together with my colleagues in oxford , we 've embarked on a research project in uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees .
it 's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution .
and in that scheme , every syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee .
so all four of these ideas that i 've presented you are ways in which we can expand amira 's choice set .
yes , they are a humanitarian responsibility , but they 're human beings with skills , talents , aspirations , with the ability to make contributions — if we let them .
man 4 : you ready ? you ready ? ( barking ) woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
child : whoa ! look at that snake !
google glass : อร่อยman 9 : mmm , อร่อย .
though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that 's one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
it was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
and that 's the shell around that globular fat .
if you walk around the city of oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone .
so , architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material .
they can actually also move towards the light . you have to just choose your species .
so , this is really interesting . now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .
and what 's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic , and that 's based on the light .
they were chosen purely because of their aesthetic , and i 'll talk more about that later .
and then eventually you 're going to go to tedglobal .
they 're the huli .
it 's because they have these extraordinary rituals .
that 's a wig on his head .
and then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise , and do n't worry , there are many birds there .
we spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty : beautiful places , beautiful things , and ultimately , beautiful people .
does it matter if i 'm a beautiful person or not , or is it purely based on my aesthetic ?
and then when i went off , i came to a very narrow conclusion .
is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant ?
this is extremely important for the end of my talk .
so what 's this all about ? well , there 's an image i 'd like to show you ,
you have to stand tall , breathe in through your nose , and i 'm going to photograph you . okay ?
how such a situation can be turned around ?
an identity was defined primarily by religion .
you could be american-italian ; you could be american-irish ; you could be british-pakistani .
but actually it 's my belief that the people who 've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until recent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances , using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies , those who 've been benefiting from this have been extremists .
and it 's not just islamist extremists that did this .
in certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned .
and i 'll give you an example here at this stage .
and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america .
so the ideas and the narratives of al-qaeda come to your mind immediately .
so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately .
there is no equivalent of the al-qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across muslim-majority societies .
to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .
what i mean by that is , if the world superpower today was a communist , it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism , than it is today with the world superpower being america , occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals .
so roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice , not merely as a political choice .
international aid and development has been going on for years , but extremism in those societies , in many of those societies , has been on the rise .
because since pre-partition , they 've been building demand for their ideology on the ground .
and what 's needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture — which is necessarily more than just elections .
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level , rather than merely on a political level , a level above politics — movements that are not political parties , but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture .
that does n't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .
and my time is up , and thank you for your time .
in developing countries , one third of that population is living in slums .
we need a participation revolution , and we need it fast .
the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore .
at the end of last year , december 16 , he received an eviction order by the rio de janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years .
we provide the patients , the afghan disabled , first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration .
it 's a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
it was a strange sensation .
i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions .
so i stopped the car and i went to help .
`` so , `` '' we can not stay here , it 's dangerous . ''
it 's really dangerous .
also one of the physical therapists reported that mahmoud could be provided with a leg , but not immediately .
and slowly , slowly week after week his legs were improving .
i tell you , it was something so sinister that i was astonished he could do it every day .
`` i told najmuddin , `` '' that 's a trick . ''
the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove .
and then we started a new policy — a new policy completely different .
and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them .
scraps of men do not exist .
physical therapies can be done , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of the people .
they are my teachers .
i have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be implemented in other countries .
we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan .
that was my story . thank you very much .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-profit called robin hood .
but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
well , i was next .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
be a mentor .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real , digital human face .
and what i 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face , using some computer graphics technology we 've developed , and also some collaborators at a company called image metrics .
by the end of the talk , we 're going to see it move .
and , as a result , it 's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have , the things that actually make us look like real humans .
so , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape , and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles .
if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily , you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions .
you can see things . not only the face shape changes , but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs .
you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down .
in addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry , since it 's all captured with cameras , we 've got a great texture map to use for the face .
we specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films .
image metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
here is the specular component animating .
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet , with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year .
and the ice that is there is quite thin .
they only need 12 days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own .
i wanted it to be more like war photography , where i was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .
this is the daily auction at the tsukiji fish market that i photographed a couple years ago .
and every single day these tuna , bluefin like this , are stacked up like cordwood , just warehouse after warehouse .
this photograph i made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour .
this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic .
this is a low-altitude photograph that i made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
and i went to the island of bimini , in the bahamas , to work with lemon shark pups .
this is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .
but despite this amazing longevity , they 're now considered critically endangered .
in the pacific , where i made this photograph , their stocks have declined about 90 percent in the last 15 years .
you can see the coal burning plant in the background .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
these are entanglement scars .
what the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in 1975 , they hoped and expected that certain things might happen .
and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years , and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s .
so i think the message is clear .
the ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point , but we must be good custodians .
i have a tough job to do .
you know , when i looked at the profile of the audience here , with their connotations and design , in all its forms , and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks , and so on , that i wanted to tell you , i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context .
now , by remoteness , i mean two or three different kinds of things .
the second , or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world , you have pockets , like slums , or shantytowns , or poorer areas , which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city , so it 's us and them .
it did not correlate with the size of classrooms .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools , as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat , and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing . it appears that way .
the literature — one part of it , the scientific literature — consistently blames et as being over-hyped and under-performing .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
they 're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments .
about eight hours later , we found this kid .
and what he was doing was , he was teaching her to browse .
he did that , and the internet explorer changed page .
at this time there was a — the main question was about english .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages .
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that 's not possible .
`` and as soon as they saw me they said , `` we need a faster processor and a better mouse . '' ''
finally , i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable , if they happen everywhere else .
so i did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india .
so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power , so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running .
and this happens very often with these computers , that the younger children are found teaching the older ones .
what did we find ? we found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment , irrespective of anything that we could measure .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you lift the adult intervention .
but we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .
and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer .
so , how do they do that ?
if you calculated the actual time of access , it would work out to minutes per day , so that 's not how it 's happening .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject .
finally , self-organizing systems , about which , again , i wo n't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it .
remoteness affects the quality of education .
powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology , but it was not meant for education , it was meant for making boardroom presentations .
we borrowed it . video conferencing . the personal computer itself .
they worked until four o'clock in the morning .
a time for even grimmer stuff than that , like in last april 's new yorker magazine .
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
well , let 's start with faron young — who was born incidentally in 1932 .
in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we 're about to see .
it is christmas day , 4 a.m .
by his own writing , this man was either asleep , at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase .
and i noticed , he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions .
( music ) ( applause )
now , al dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies , he 'd close down 30 percent of the workforce .
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
and when they finally hand you heartache , when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat , you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother .
and that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie .
but phil and i decided to reinvent project v.o.i.c.e. , this time changing the mission to using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain , educate and inspire .
it 's clear that when i was a child , i definitely walked through life like this .
and you , you get to share mine .
and i find that sort of scary .
loyalty essentially is a micro-economy .
so admittedly it 's a currency at the moment that 's purely for the kindle .
so they 're going into convenience stores , stealing tide , and a $ 20 bottle of tide is equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed .
so nike is literally acting as a well-being partner , a health and fitness partner and service provider .
in africa , you know , airtime has become literally a currency in its own right .
and on this day , at this moment , we walked into the house with our first child , our beautiful baby boy .
( video ) man : okay .
here 's our living room , the baby bedroom , kitchen , dining room and the rest of the house .
( laughter ) and what this data represents for our family at a personal level , the impact has already been immense , and we 're still learning its value .
i 'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form .
`` my son , soon after his first birthday , would say `` '' gaga '' '' to mean water . ''
dr : he sure nailed it , did n't he .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
and we would plot the relative length of the utterances .
and what we found was this curious phenomena , that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum , making language as simple as possible , and then slowly ascend back up in complexity .
but that 's looking at the speech context .
we 've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras , and we 've done some optical correction , and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life .
we 're now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
`` and we see these amazing structures — these little knots of two colors of thread we call `` '' social hot spots . '' '' the spiral thread we call a `` '' solo hot spot . '' '' and we think that these affect the way language is learned . ''
and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
this is the wordscape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
so we 're pulling in about three billion comments a month , and then the magic happens .
this is a subset of data from our database — just 50,000 out of several million — and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources .
so we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials , and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph .
that drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once — captured on film .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
and so let 's fly back in time to that memorable moment .
( laughter ) ( applause ) dr : thank you . ( applause )
do you trust politicians ? do you trust teachers ?
that 's a perfectly rational thing .
so if we 've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust .
secondly , what about the aim ?
well frankly , i think that 's a stupid aim .
in fact , i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy .
and i 'm very glad to say , i do n't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest .
trust is the response .
you can all give your own examples there .
well , we can do that for ourselves .
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
so the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls , much more about being trustworthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you 're trustworthy .
thanks .
they have the capacity for an infinite number of rights .
humans and legal persons are not synonymous .
and so in the fall of 1771 , james somerset had a confrontation with charles stewart .
we do n't know exactly what happened , but then james dropped out of sight .
then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be .
and so we chose chimpanzees , and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition .
they know they 're individuals , and that they can live .
tommy is a chimpanzee . you see him behind me .
and these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee , with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to africa as possible .
there 's more to this painting than meets the eye .
i can photograph it from any angle , and it will still look 2d .
one of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only did n't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears , but he also did n't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition , like the metro .
sometimes , when sheila would lay down in the milk , it would wash all the paint off of her arms , and it might seem a little bit clumsy , but our solution would be , okay , hide your arms .
and we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined , even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he ca n't draw hands , just hiding them in the pockets .
and it 's no surprise that we feel that way , because according to the epa , americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors .
it 's a predictable emotional connection , and we 've been using this trick for a long , long time .
we used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
this is the livingston public library that was completed in 2004 in my hometown , and , you know , it 's got a dome and it 's got this round thing and columns , red brick , and you can kind of guess what livingston is trying to say with this building : children , property values and history .
okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s .
this is really tough stuff .
we add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials .
( laughter ) so architects get frustrated , and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction .
we throw out historical symbols , we rely on new , computer-aided design techniques , and we come up with new compositions , forms crashing into forms .
this is academic and heady stuff , it 's super unpopular , we totally alienate you .
the new york times called this building a miracle .
so did every mayor in the world .
let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed .
we proposed a building that was audacious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook and we put onto instagram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
think for a second about those librarians back in livingston .
`` if that building was going to be built today , the first thing they would do is go online and search `` '' new libraries . '' '' they would be bombarded by examples of experimentation , of innovation , of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be . ''
that 's ammunition .
architects can hear you , and you 're not intimidated by architecture .
we can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces .
and it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around .
because it does n't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings .
buildings do n't just reflect our society , they shape our society down to the smallest spaces : the local libraries , the homes where we raise our children , and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom .
( music ) okay , i wrote that . ( laughter ) no , it 's not — ( applause ) oh , why thank you .
no , no , i did n't write that .
i mean , you — i 'm just like , a hush , huh — it 's like — ( laughter ) it 's beethoven , how can you say that ?
so this is an engaging enterprise for me , and i 've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there , and now my face appears twice , so i think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise . ( laughter ) but it 's an engaging one , and it 's interesting to me for a while , but then i get bored with it , and by it , i actually mean , the piano , because it becomes , it 's this familiar instrument , it 's timbral range is actually pretty compressed , at least when you play on the keyboard , and if you 're not doing things like listening to it after you 've lit it on fire or something like that , you know .
it gets a little bit boring , and so pretty soon i go through other instruments , they become familiar , and eventually i find myself designing and constructing my own instrument , and i brought one with me today , and i thought i would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like .
so we have this sound . ( music ) and with a bank of live electronics , i can change the sounds radically . ( music ) ( music ) like that , and like this . ( music ) and so forth .
i 'm crying on the inside . there are still scars .
so this is a case of actually adapting something , or maybe stealing something , and then turning it into a musical notation .
i took the idea of the wristwatch , and i turned it into a musical score .
they follow the second hands , and as they pass over the various symbols , the players respond musically .
another role that i like to take on is that of the performance artist .
`` some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements , and i often perform them . i want to show you a clip from a piece called `` '' echolalia . '' '' this is actually being performed by brian mcwhorter , who is an extraordinary performer . ''
and we want to learn other languages .
a different way of life , a different being .
and so , i want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania — ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
during that time , there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work .
so this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
and she 'll come in to sit at this computer — it 's like a video game for a kid ; she 's hooked .
and her concentration — she 's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wants to do it all over again , just for the satisfaction of having done it better .
the long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and sisters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
and we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
they pat one another on the back ; they swagger ; they shake their fist — the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of context .
but this teaches us a new respect — and it 's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , i suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .
once we 're prepared to admit that after all , we 're not the only beings with personalities , minds and above all feelings , and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient , sapient creatures on this planet , it really gives cause for deep shame , at least for me .
they 're disappearing in the heart of their range in africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads — as they want to do in ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched — to take out oil or timber .
we see deforestation ; we see the desert spreading ; we see massive hunger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support , and they 're too poor to buy food from elsewhere .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language — a language with which we can tell children about things that are n't here .
we can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
and the most important message of roots and shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
every individual has a role to play .
and now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world .
how many more minutes ? two , one ?
chris anderson : one — one to two .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
and it 's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
secondly , the resilience of nature .
we can destroy a river , and we can bring it back to life .
we can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help .
this bell is made from metal from a defused landmine , from the killing fields of pol pot — one of the most evil regimes in human history — where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled .
thank you .
if nothing else , at least i 've discovered what it is we put our speakers through : sweaty palms , sleepless nights , a wholly unnatural fear of clocks .
it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future , and perhaps the world 's future overall .
here 's a clue .
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
we are learning from them .
but what 's key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally — a picture , a music file , software .
i do n't think it will be .
here , let me introduce you to sam haber .
before youtube , there was no way for him to discover his sport 's true potential , because you ca n't communicate this stuff in words , right ?
so it 's not far-fetched to say that , at some point , online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .
here 's another example that 's close to our hearts at ted , where video is sometimes more powerful than print — the sharing of an idea .
all those ideas are already out there in print .
and in that non-verbal portion , there 's some serious magic .
print scaled .
the world 's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine .
we may have to reinvent an ancient art form .
i mean , today , one person speaking can be seen by millions , shedding bright light on potent ideas , creating intense desire for learning and to respond — and in his case , intense desire to laugh .
because , if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool , this wheel turns .
but the good news is they are out there .
within five years , each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full-on web video and capable of uploading video to the web .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
tie knots have names .
this is a language we made up for the patterns of tie knots , and a half-windsor is all that .
this is also a pattern .
i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is .
so how in the world can these dots represent the word ?
well , they do .
have a look at the curve .
it 's actually not a part of a circle .
perhaps i should extend the lines like this , and look for the pattern there .
one perspective is , it 's a sum .
it all depends on how many digits you have .
they sound like this together . ( beeps ) this is the sound of four-thirds .
( clanking sounds ) sounds kind of boring , but listen to them together .
( drumbeats and cowbell ) and i can keep doing this and play games with this number .
( laughter ) truly — it 's an undervalued number .
so if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere , it 's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder .
and i 'm a teacher and a lecturer , and i can actually use this to teach something , because when i give someone else another story , a metaphor , an analogy , if i tell a story from a different point of view , i enable understanding .
let 's do a simple example again .
i can take two of these and put them together like this and see what happens .
have a look at it if i spin it around like this .
and if i take a bicycle pump and just pump it up , you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron .
i think this actually is the essence of understanding something .
i truly believe this .
so this thing about changing your perspective — it 's absolutely fundamental for humans .
so all of these are different perspectives .
we can go into the water .
this is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
so that was a sort of a success .
i mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the vienna philharmonic orchestra .
um , he was happy .
you have the story of the audience as a community . yeah .
you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience .
riccardo muti , please .
`` so he says , `` '' if i 'm — ( applause ) if i 'm responsible for mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told . ''
you 're using us as instruments , not as partners .
but how does it happen ? did you see him turning pages in the score ?
let 's see another super-conductor , a german super-conductor . herbert von karajan , please .
like muti . you ready ? because muti ...
audience : ( claps ) ( laughter ) itay talgam : why not together ? ( laughter ) because you did n't know when to play .
`` he says , `` '' this is the gesture of the music . ''
it 's not a physical thing . it 's in the players ' heads .
and the level in which kleiber is in control is in a different level .
( music ) do you remember the face of muti , at the beginning ?
well he had a wonderful expression , but only one .
and you look at lenny and he 's suffering .
and for the last video , i think this is simply the best title .
i 'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
shaheen 's background i do n't even know .
and when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body .
anjali 's father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
i was 15 when i was gang-raped by eight men .
but what lingered from then till now — i am 40 today — is this huge outrageous anger .
most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
and it 's abnormal to live in a shelter .
understanding my own self , understanding my own pain , my own isolation , was my greatest teacher .
my challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
i 've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue .
a very supportive friend of mine , a well-wisher of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 rupees for vegetables .
it 's very nice for discussion , discourse , making films and everything .
they need , much more than anything else , your acceptance .
can you just encompass these people too ?
so here it is . you can check : i am short , i 'm french , i have a pretty strong french accent , so that 's going to be clear in a moment .
maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .
maybe you look at the past and see .
africans have already got a lot of aid .
okay , fine . how do you know what would have happened without the aid ?
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
they 're smaller questions , but they are not that small .
immunization , that 's the cheapest way to save a child 's life .
and the world has spent a lot of money on it : the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it , and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .
how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem ?
and a third question : education .
that 's bad , but there are places like that .
so you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .
and maybe when you get there , what you find is this : the subcenter is closed . ao you have to come back , and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do , you will always tend to postpone and postpone , and eventually it gets too late .
because a , we can make it easy , and b , we can maybe give people a reason to act today , rather than wait till tomorrow .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization .
afterwards , the camp — just having the camp — increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent .
and the third one is : do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
and this one that was in kenya , they went around and distributed to people vouchers , discount vouchers .
and some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
there are so many things you could do . you could pay for uniforms , you could eliminate fees , you could build latrines , you could give girls sanitary pads , etc. , etc .
so , is that sufficient ? if we think they should work intuitively , should we go for them ?
well , in business , that 's certainly not the way we would go about it .
well , if that had been the case , there would have been no industrial revolution .
so why should n't we do the same with social policy ?
in technology , we spend so much time experimenting , fine-tuning , getting the absolute cheapest way to do something , so why are n't we doing that with social policy ?
how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars ?
so , first , it 's mostly invisible ; second , it 's huge ; and third , we do n't know whether we are doing the right thing .
with deworming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .
worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
and thanks to deworm the world , and the effort of many country governments and foundations , 20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009 .
it 's a very slow process .
these economics i 'm proposing , it 's like 20th century medicine .
`` and so all of a sudden , a poem appeared in the papers in baghdad comparing me to many things , but among them an `` '' unparalleled serpent . '' '' and so i happened to have a snake pin . ''
so i wore it when we talked about iraq .
`` you want to get the feeling of the room , and `` '' do people like me ? '' '' and `` '' will i really say something intelligent ? '' '' and all of a sudden i thought , `` '' well , wait a minute . ''
so i think that it behooves us — those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice — that we need to help other women .
and i really dedicated myself to that , both at the u.n. and then as secretary of state .
ma : from some people .
`` pm : is that `` '' girl 7 ? '' '' ma : girl 7 . ''
( laughter ) but the bottom line is that there is a way , when there are more women at the table , that there 's an attempt to develop some understanding .
`` or `` '' are n't your children suffering because you 're not there all the time ? '' '' and i think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty . ''
it 's got a nice kind of flowing , organic form , very consistent with the brazilian culture — i think good design adds to culture .
pedestrian traffic was protected .
and so i look at this bike as not being a designer bike , but being a very good example of design .
and since that time in amsterdam , i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities , looking at design for common evidence of design that really is n't under so much of a designer 's signature .
i was in buenos aires very recently , and i went to see this bridge by santiago calatrava .
and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge — i love bridges , metaphorically and symbolically and structurally — and it was a bit of a disappointment , because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it ; it really was n't in use .
but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life — kind of unintended piece of design .
construction site in new york : red having this kind of emotional power that 's almost an equivalent with the way in which — cuteness of puppies and such .
and cuba needs to be far more resourceful , because of the blockades and things , but a really wonderful playground .
and i realized that , you know , italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem , or they can choose to ignore them , but these — you do n't have warring factions , and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy so innovative and so tolerant .
and i use this — this is , sort of , what i consider to be urban spam .
now , this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop , and can do stuff , but this was an actual moment when i got off my bike , and i looked and i thought , it 's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement .
i was in a small restaurant in spain , having lunch — one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself , and you have a glass of wine , and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet , and feeling very lucky , and a bus load of tourists arrived , emptied out , filled up the restaurant .
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced — kind of , large masses of things , and when you — in monoculture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that 's important to us .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
this is also in millennium park in chicago , where the spanish artist-designer plensa has created , kind of , a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area .
and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly .
and in order to introduce you to that , i 've got something here that i 'm going to unveil , which is one of the great marvels of the modern age .
we can turn it into a dazzling array of materials , medicine , modern clothing , laptops , a whole range of different things .
and it 's increasingly clear that we are n't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever .
already that 's fallen to about 11 .
the moment when the world on average passes this peak , people wonder when that 's going to happen .
actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years ' time .
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
transitional is completely different .
and it 's a process which is really joyful .
people have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it .
one of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience .
it 's a process which is playful and creative and informative .
they are mulling whether they 're going to take it further .
we need international legislation from copenhagen and so on .
promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who do n't have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they are n't using anymore .
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
and we see it all over the place as well now .
because i think stories are vital here .
in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today , we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy .
i wo n't show you very many graphs today , but if i can just focus on this one for a moment , it really tells us a lot of what we need to know — which is , quite simply , that if you look , for example , at transportation , a major category of climate emissions , there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air .
and the correlation , of course , is that denser places tend to have lower emissions — which is n't really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
and this is a huge , huge energy savings , because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars .
some of it is about walking . it 's not all perfect yet .
i asked how to do the greater ridgeway , and it told me to go via guernsey .
things that do n't have any wiring in them at all , we 're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation .
so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on — like heating , cooling etc . — and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on .
so we have visions like this .
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?
someone who looks like me walks past you in the street .
( applause ) let me just set something out from the outset : unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination .
we all have our biases .
because the clickity-clack of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away .
and look , we all do it .
ladies and gentlemen , the surgeon is his mother .
look , i do n't want to be picked because i 'm a chick , i want to be picked because i have merit , because i 'm the best person for the job .
can you imagine me running one of these ?
`` and he 's like , `` '' yassmin , i do n't know how you can surf with all that gear you 've got on , and i do n't know any women-only beaches . '' '' and then , the guy came up with a brilliant idea , he was like , `` '' i know , you run that organization youth without borders , right ? ''
let me offer you a solution .
and if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth do n't matter , we all have to be part of the solution .
people are not born with equal opportunity .
i was born in one of the poorest cities in the world , khartoum .
a young muslim man in sydney who ended up using his mentor 's help to start up a poetry slam in bankstown and now it 's a huge thing .
and he 's able to change the lives of so many other young people .
or a lady here in brisbane , an afghan lady who 's a refugee , who could barely speak english when she came to australia , her mentors helped her become a doctor and she took our young queenslander of the year award in 2008 .
this is so not smooth .
and i encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because i bet you , they 're probably wrong .
from the photosynthetic growth , it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use , the 30 billion barrels we use per year .
i 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions , but i did finally figure it out . i had to figure it out , because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector , so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would .
so , whenever given an opportunity , i try to do something in it or with it or for it .
maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this .
eventually , i realized that i had really no content that i could count on , so i decided to move towards packaging . ( laughter ) i mean , it seems to work for a lot of things .
this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of , but it would be like having a ruler — sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler .
the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around , and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view — looking in the hole , getting a different kind of perspective , moving you around the space . particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus .
anyway , the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff .
unfortunately , that 's a problem : they get a little too close , and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes .
so , he keeps on moving , approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street .
i mean , you always peel one layer off another ; we think of them as pages , doing it a certain way .
but think of them as layers . i mean , rome is a place of layers — horizontal layers , vertical layers — and i thought , well just peeling off a page would allow me to — if i got you thinking about it the right way — would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers .
the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars ; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down .
i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it .
but more importantly , i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco , which is more often the case .
so i went back to the notion of story , which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way .
maybe it has to go back and live with family members ; that 's not always a good thing , but it does sort of bring pigeons together again .
we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese — designed by michelangelo , built of stone taken from the coliseum — narrow escape .
through the alley , we can see the impact is captured in the red line .
one day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
so maybe that 's why we think of fear , sometimes , as a danger in and of itself .
`` `` do n't worry , '' we like to say to one another . `` do n't panic . '' ''
so the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner .
but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water .
to be eaten by cannibals , to be battered by storms , to starve to death before reaching land .
what if instead of calling them fears , we called them stories ?
our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel .
our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense .
but just as importantly , we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears , and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives .
`` herman melville , who used this story as research for `` '' moby dick , '' '' wrote years later , and from dry land , quote , `` '' all the sufferings of these miserable men of the essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they , immediately after leaving the wreck , steered straight for tahiti . ''
the problem was that they listened to the wrong story .
properly read , our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature : a little wisdom , a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing — the truth .
take the money ; go to amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you 've never been to — call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
( laughter ) heck , if i ran the web , you could email dead people . ( laughter )
that links with hotdiggitydog.com .
( laughter ) huh ? maybe google would hire this .
prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area .
you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush .
so i like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work .
we tell them , okay , we 're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there 's no director . instead you 've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background .
so we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
`` so , he said , `` '' before puberty , if my two daughters were messing around in a shop , i 'd say , 'hey , stop messing around and i 'll sing your favorite song , ' and instantly they 'd stop messing around and he 'd sing their favorite song . after puberty , that became the threat . ''
`` so people often ask , `` '' well , is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon ? ''
and yet , this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable .
before march , 2011 , i was a photographic retoucher based in new york city .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
now , it was n't until this point that i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
so we started retouching photos .
within japan , by july , we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata , further north to a town called yamada .
they 're our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for .
the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers .
for some of them , it 's given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
but i bet there 's something you did n't think about today — something so close to home that you probably do n't think about it very often at all .
and they 've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons .
now unlike a human-designed computer , where there 's a fairly small number of different parts — we know how they work , because we humans designed them — the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells , maybe tens of thousands .
there 's a class of cells , a fairly small cell , an inhibitory cell , that quiets its neighbors .
they 're excitatory .
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
now before i tell you about the technology , the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room , if we live long enough , will encounter , perhaps , a brain disorder .
and also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry .
well there are many molecules that exist in nature , which are able to convert light into electricity .
so this turned out to be very simple to do .
and you can do that ; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others .
if we can deliver that gene to these cells — and they 're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene , of course — and then flash blue light over the entire brain network , just these cells are going to be driven .
and also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction .
so what we do is we play that tone again after it 's been associated with fear .
okay , there it goes . right now .
and now you can see , just 10 minutes into the experiment , that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory .
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they 're embedded .
and we 've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life — every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
now how could you repair this ?
it 's being led by one of our collaborators , alan horsager at usc , and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company eos neuroscience , which is funded by the nih .
these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans .
we 're developing these tools , but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world , so people can study and try to treat different disorders .
the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors , like an on/off switch .
eb : right , yeah .
so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .
( video ) : man : ... extremely dangerous questions .
even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization .
their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of , but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne , emerging communicable diseases .
and in fact , with increasing globalization — for which there are big winners and even bigger losers — today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history .
as we look at these trends , do we become despondent , or will we become energized ?
what will that do to bangladesh ? let 's take a look .
global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once .
it 's just the beginning , unfortunately .
all throughout the technology world , we 're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .
they 're not waiting until they die to create foundations .
certainly , nothing can give you more optimism than that .
that means that people are beginning the first step , which is acting out of their own self-interest .
but for me , i have another reason to be an incurable optimist .
pharaoh ramses the fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox , and they went home to die .
thank you very much .
i 'm progressive , politically — big surprise — but i 've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives .
i like hearing what they 're thinking about ; i like seeing what they link to ; i like learning a thing or two .
and they were looking at the netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
`` you know we all want to be someone who has watched `` '' rashomon , '' '' but right now we want to watch `` '' ace ventura '' '' for the fourth time . ''
that , in fact , you could n't have a functioning democracy if citizens did n't get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
so in the oasis of intelligentsia that is ted , i stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places .
in fact , it feels like i 've been transported straight here from four months in the middle of nowhere , mostly grunting and swearing , straight to the ted stage .
this is the first talk i 've given about this expedition , and while we were n't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes , this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that had n't been done before .
it 's twice the size of australia , a continent that is the same size as china and india put together .
scott 's team ended up on foot .
no one 's come close to that ever since .
and of course some strange and predictable combination of curiosity , stubbornness , and probably hubris led me to thinking i might be the man to try to finish the job .
we did n't see a sunset either .
so it 's a bit different these days , and there are also acres of junk .
if you have the right team around you , the right tools , the right technology , and if you have enough self-belief and enough determination , then anything is possible .
we had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey , so we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half the calories we should have been eating .
you become utterly incapacitated .
i 've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks .
being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar , which is that i 've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that i can find .
they needed repairing almost every hour .
to give you an idea of scale , this is looking down towards the mouth of the beardmore glacier .
you could fit the entirety of manhattan in the gap on the horizon .
as i said , there are very few superficial signs that i 've been away .
i 've put on 30 pounds .
i 've got one on my nose , one on each cheek , from where the goggles are , but inside i am a very different person indeed .
a room like this , nonetheless .
and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge .
i looked at the clock .
( laughter ) and this made me feel even more ridiculous — hurt , really .
i just believed a new thing : that it was possible not to believe .
but when i found myself back home one winter break , with my face planted in the floor , my hands tied behind my back and a burglar 's gun pressed to my head , i knew that even the best education could n't save me .
`` the work began in the dark corner of a crowded party , in the late night of an early , miserable cambridge winter , when three friends and i asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time : `` what if we took a road trip ? '' ''
this doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me , because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings , when the truth is that there will be no miracles here .
( applause )
in the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
he wrote about my strengths , weaknesses , and gentle suggestions for improvement , quoting specific incidents , and held a mirror to my life .
i 'm all for email and thinking while typing , but why give up old habits for new ?
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug .
i collect autographed books , and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them — and cds too , tracy .
as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
♫ alors je sens en moi ♫ ♫ mon coeur qui bat ♫ ( applause )
i 'd like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
they 're all the perfect size , and they do n't have an ounce of fat .
let 's see how we can do it with tissue engineering .
one of the key technologies that 's really important is what 's called induced pluripotent stem cells .
okay , induced pluripotent stem cells .
he generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have lou gehrig 's disease , and he differentiated them into neurons , and what 's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease .
but that 's not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments .
and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next , and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies .
we 're facing this problem .
so we 're getting the dynamics out of the body as well .
so we have to do something that 's a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so what we do is that we put all these slices together .
using computers , even though they 're getting faster and better all the time , it 's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information .
this is as of 9 a.m. this morning .
so please go back home , tell your kids to play more games , because that 's what i need .
she had a bleeding up in the brain , and that 's been fixed with a little stent , a metal clamp that 's tightening up the vessel .
i can look at the skull structure , and i can see that , okay , this is where they opened up the skull on this woman , and that 's where they went in .
and you can see how i 'm gradually peeling off .
in the forensic case — and this is something that ... there 's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of sweden that i come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years .
so this will be the typical workflow situation .
the police will decide — in the evening , when there 's a case coming in — they will decide , okay , is this a case where we need to do an autopsy ?
so in the morning , in between six and seven in the morning , the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners .
and this women also ended up under the car , so she 's quite badly beaten up by this injury .
it 's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body .
you can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth — that 's actually the filling of the teeth — but because i 've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent .
so if you were thinking of buying an ipad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
and so i can generate a force feedback .
so when i virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
if i push even harder , i 'll go through the bone structure , especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft .
and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain .
so this is a lion from the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden , elsa .
and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology , because there 's very little known about the animal anatomy .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
and then i saw it — could it be possible ? — my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car — a pasting i 'd done a year earlier — an illegal one — still there .
a year later , i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
`` the army will shoot you , and hamas will kidnap you . '' '' we said , `` '' okay , let 's try and push as far as we can . '' '' i love the way that people will ask me , `` how big will my photo be ? '' ''
`` and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , `` so can you tell me who is who ? '' ''
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
i just took their pictures and pasted them .
`` and she said , `` '' you know what ? ''
the day after , i came back and they were already scratched .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
there was the mother , the grandmother , the best friend — they all wanted to shout the story .
so how can we know about the project ?
during that time , you have n't thought about what you 're going to eat tomorrow .
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
so i asked the people what happened .
`` `` oh , that guy just moved . '' ''
( applause ) thank you .
for each project we do a film .
that 's rio .
you understand the full scope of the project .
( applause ) this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally , and i pasted it in southern italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
art can change the way we see the world .
i wanted that wish to actually start now .
he could ask that because he knew new yorkers and they knew him .
it runs through cities .
the former is a natural , essential part of life , part of the deal , and to this we are called to make space , adjust , grow .
and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my ipod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to puff daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent — there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind — and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
i heard about this lake , lake imja .
many , many people have died on mt . everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .
i put on my ipod , i listened to some music , i got myself as aggressive as possible — but controlled aggression — and then i hurled myself into that water .
i could barely breathe .
and luckily , the water was quite shallow , and i was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .
and so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
so thank you very , very much .
and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly .
and here is its first test .
lynn verinsky : because of liability insurance . ( laughter ) narrator : with a mattress below and attached to a safety rope , lynn began her 60-foot ascent .
but she actually used these on smooth surfaces — two of them — to climb up , and pull herself up .
you see something on it . it 's not just to look like a gecko .
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance .
see that tail ? that 's incredible !
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we 've talked about an active tail .
so here is normal speed .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
if we could have the lights on it .
( laughter ) so we did . and here is what it does .
and then — we had to film this several times to believe this — it also does this . watch this .
maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees , and trying to control a glide .
you can see it even better from down on top .
`` so we went , `` '' oh my god , we have to go to the field , and see if it actually does this . '' '' completely opposite of the way you 'd see it on a nature film , of course . ''
so there it comes down . there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line .
so to conclude , i think we need to build biomutualisms , like i showed , that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application .
and that 's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
in our early days we used to work a lot on rockets , but we also used to have a lot of parties , you know .
but then a big difference happened about 50 years ago , after sputnik was launched . we launched the first american satellite , and that 's the one you see on the left in there .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
the music 's half of me , but the other half — i landed probably the best gig of all .
and anyone who tells you you ca n't , you do n't listen to them .
well , the way i think about it is fairly simple .
why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved ?
you can skip the dust part .
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
it 's a planet somewhat similar to earth . it 's a little bit smaller , but the land mass on mars is about the same as the land mass on earth , you know , if you do n't take the oceans into account .
so , it basically dwarfs , you know , mount everest here on earth .
recently from one of our satellites , this shows that it 's earth-like — we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening .
if you were there you would n't do it yourself .
but still they are producing a lot of scientific data .
so let me go on the next short video .
what is he doing ?
as i said earlier , it looked very much like earth , so you see sand dunes .
rg : the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees fahrenheit .
so , we 're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be .
that 's like taking two empire state buildings and stacking them on top of one another .
bc : edl is this immense , technically challenging problem .
what we want to do is to make sure we have an effective , you know , an efficient kind of machine .
if you are going to jupiter , you have a very high-radiation , you know , environment . it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor .
so these are kind of some of the little challenges , you know , that we have to face .
to give you an idea of the size , you know , of that parachute relative to the people standing there .
next step , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them , you know , in the lab at jpl , in what we call our mars yard .
now , in that case , because it was a very big rover , we could n't use airbags .
and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings , which are the particles .
one of them is called enceladus .
if you look at these stripes in here , what we call tiger stripes , when we flew over them , all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature , which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet .
we saw geysers coming out .
and somehow , through some dynamic effect , we 're having these geysers which are being , you know , emitted from it .
now , another satellite also attracted a lot of attention , and that 's titan . and the reason titan is particularly interesting , it 's a satellite bigger than our moon , and it has an atmosphere .
so it 's very much like the cycle on earth except because it 's so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen .
and just to kind of put us in perspective , this is a picture of saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind saturn , looking towards the sun .
so thank you very much .
now why is that important ?
you can open your eyes now .
rather than stopping and turning around , athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction .
and this happened throughout the sports world .
( laughter ) that is , find six honest seven footers , one is in the nba right now .
`` this is leonardo da vinci 's `` '' vitruvian man , '' '' the ideal proportions , with arm span equal to height . ''
and while the large got larger and the small got smaller , the weird got weirder .
in swimming , the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs .
and they happen , on average , to have a certain unique physiology : legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity , and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate , and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes .
our brain acts as a limiter , preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources , because we might hurt ourselves , tearing tendons or ligaments .
but the more we learn about how that limiter functions , the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit , in some cases by convincing the brain that the body wo n't be in mortal danger by pushing harder .
they have no buns because they do n't run upright .
it 's so steep he ca n't even run here .
and talented though he is , kílian is not a physiological freak .
now that he has done this , other athletes will follow , just as other athletes followed after sir roger bannister ran under four minutes in the mile .
sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we do n't even question how much we 're doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it does n't even occur to us that it 's not okay .
things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [ activity ] , ten percent in fact , on both of those .
now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you 're anything like me , it wo n't .
it 's changed my life .
thank you .
it 's a place where we do n't have to worry about how we 're being perceived by the outside world .
he 's a local pastor , and they treated him like a celebrity .
that 's because almost 40 percent of black men have it .
so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men ?
you can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs .
black men have been with their current barbers on average as long as i 've been with denny , about eight years .
the very first research project that i worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black men .
the next stop on my journey was dallas , texas , where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community .
and if it looks like greek to you , it 's because , well , it 's greek .
this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .
calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy : there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck .
and of course , you all know that the answer is dogs .
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes .
they do n't come quickly to mind , and as a result , we vastly underestimate them .
when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ?
`` and most people say , `` '' ok , i 'll play . '' '' now , a slightly different version of this lottery : imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named leroy . ''
assuming you wanted to go to hawaii , would you buy this package ?
you 're on your way to the theater .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
in both cases , it was a piece of paper .
and so a retailer , if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine , and you see them here for eight , 27 and 33 dollars , what would you do ?
here 's why that 's a problem : the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bottle of wine home , it wo n't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to .
for some of the subjects , sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates , and for others is a can of spam .
namely , those who are looking at spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty ; those who are looking at godiva chocolate think they wo n't be nearly so tasty .
you 've all experienced this yourself , even if you 've never come into our lab to eat potato chips . so here 's a question : you want to buy a car stereo .
the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars , but if you drive across town , you can get it for 100 bucks .
now , let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo , and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 .
this kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
because this 100 dollars that you save — hello ! — does n't know where it came from .
people have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time .
all of us , i hope , prefer more money , and the reason is , we believe more is better than less .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year — that 's 12 months — or 60 dollars in 13 months .
what you see here are two lads , one of them larger than the other : the fireman and the fiddler .
at a very close distance , the fiddler looks taller than the fireman , but at a far distance their normal , their true , relations are preserved .
we have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future .
they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups , rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves , had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today .
bernoulli 's gift , bernoulli 's little formula , allows us , it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us .
that explains why we are so bad at using it , but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good , fast .
if we 're not here in 10,000 years , it 's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in 1738 , because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures .
talk more about it .
what is it ?
and so we evolved these responses .
any animal you see that you 've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you 've never seen before .
it 's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain , and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you 've lost .
and so fundamentally , the reason we got to the moon is , we did n't listen to the economists . thank you very much .
now , i think there 's many good reasons not to listen to economists .
adg : in persuading them .
to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .
`` i think in general you 're battling a very fundamental human tendency , which is to say , `` '' i 'm here today , and so now is more important than later . '' '' ca : dan , thank you . members of the audience , that was a fantastic session . thank you . ''
but recently , we 've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight , to actually find ways to improve the world , to do something better , to actually fix things , not just understand things .
and actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people 's searching behavior today , we could know where the flu — what the status of the epidemic was today , what 's the prevalence of the epidemic today .
so here on the y-axis , we have the percent of the people affected , and on the x-axis , we have time .
now , who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network ?
and what we show here is — like , here — very few people are affected , more and more and more and up to here , and here 's the peak of the epidemic .
the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree , and are more central than the random people themselves .
now , in addition to that , if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product , for example , what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population , also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends .
when did the randoms — when did the friends take off and leave the randoms , and [ when did ] their curve start shifting ?
so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
if we immunize 960 of them , it 's as if we had immunized a hundred [ percent ] of them .
`` or another example would be , if you 're a phone company , you figure out who 's central in the network and you ask those people , `` '' look , will you just text us your fever every day ? ''
`` just text us your temperature . '' '' and collect vast amounts of information about people 's temperature , but from centrally located individuals . ''
but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible .
so , i 'm going to , like , go through some slides from way back when , and walk through them to give you a sense of how i end up here .
it 's such a great way to — i mean , they should make java books like this , and we 've have no problem learning a program .
i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle .
but , anyway , that 's where i grew up , in this little tofu factory in seattle , and it was kind of like this : a small room where i kind of grew up . i 'm big there in that picture .
and that was torture , real torture .
bad blocks . but anyways , the tofu to me was kind of my origin , basically .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
i made a desktop publishing system way back when , and that was , kind of , my first step into figuring out how to — oh , these two sides are kind of fun to mix .
and then luckily , you know , i had the fortune of going to something called a library , and in the library i came upon this very book .
it 's a little slim volume ; i 'm not sure if you 've seen this .
i got my masters , and then went to art school after that .
remember that moment — publishing your designs ?
remember that moment ? it felt so good , did n't it ?
i did n't quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer , you know , a crusty designer , like a good — kind of like a good french bread ?
it took a month to make this part .
it became computerish ; we began to think computerish — the x , y system — and so that was kind of a revelation .
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people , called a human-powered computer .
and it 's a sort of a working computer . and when i built this computer , i had a moment of — what is it called ? — the epiphany where i realized that the computer 's just so fast .
and these hands were influenced by this man , mr. inami naomi .
the computer lives in so many dimensions .
and here 's this , like , dirty , kind of , shoddy , kind of , dark computer room .
it did n't make any sense .
i made — i took my old macintoshes and made different objects out of them from tokyo .
and so computers , as you know , these big computers , there are now tiny computers .
so anyways , there are all these things you can do , but the thing i love the most is to experience , taste the world .
we think we 'll go to a museum ; that 's where all the tastes are .
we all are creative people .
i discovered that i had to find the equation of art and design , which we know as circle-triangle-square .
it 's everywhere on the beach , i discovered .
i was , like , aha , wait a second .
it 's a strange exuberance about materials , about the world : a fascination that i think the world needs quite very much right now .
this was a perfect introduction .
and it was a technology that was inevitable .
it 's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things , including changing biology .
if you look at the origins of this , the classic history sort of takes it all back to the eniac here .
rca started this whole thing off , and said , you know , televisions are the future , not computers .
von neumann , and a logician , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
they were using vacuum tubes , very narrow , sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes .
reports were issued , so that this machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world .
then they switched to a magnetic drum .
and this is the beginning of computer graphics .
so they are always trying to figure out , what 's machine error ? what 's human error ?
he had to focus the memory — seems ok .
if you 're a mathematician , you get that , because marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there .
`` `` machine a thing of beauty , and a joy forever . '' `` perfect running . '' ''
`` `` parting thought : when there 's bigger and better errors , we 'll have them . '' ''
so von neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems .
barricelli , he came to do what we now call , really , artificial life , trying to see if , in this artificial universe — he was a viral-geneticist , way , way , way ahead of his time .
so it 's almost exactly — it 's 50 years ago next tuesday , i guess .
he had a wonderful rapport .
`` `` if it 's that easy to create living organisms , why not create a few yourself ? '' ''
you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
that the programs , instead of being turned off — when you quit the program , you 'd keep running and , basically , all the sorts of things like windows is doing , running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines , he envisioned all that happening .
you know , could we get them running ?
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life .
it 's a world that von neumann himself envisioned .
it took really three people : barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing ; von neumann saw how you could build the machines — that now , last count , four million of these von neumann machines is built every 24 hours ; and julian bigelow , who died 10 days ago — this is john markoff 's obituary for him — he was the important missing link , the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work .
and that 's the end .
i hold certain truths to be self-evident : women are equal to men .
there 's more .
i hold these truths to be self-evident , but let me be clear : i 'm a mess .
when i drive to work , i listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume .
`` bitch , you got ta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt ! '' '' ( laughter ) think about it . ( laughter ) ''
( laughter ) pink is my favorite color .
`` i watch `` '' the bachelor '' '' and romantic comedies , and i have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true . ''
listen , if that 's good feminism — i am a very bad feminist .
bad feminism — or really , more inclusive feminism — is a starting point .
but — when i justify bad choices , i make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve , and i need to own that .
i think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .
without these efforts , without taking these stands , our accomplishments are going to mean very little .
we can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power — editors , movie and music producers , ceos , lawmakers — the people who can make bigger , braver choices to create lasting , meaningful change .
there was an incident .
i learned to write like them , and then i learned to write as myself .
i am a bad feminist , i am a good woman , i am trying to become better in how i think , and what i say , and what i do , without abandoning everything that makes me human .
i hope that we can all do the same .
in india , we have these huge families .
this man was extremely successful : he was confident and powerful .
he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes .
and he 's not the only one in the world .
it looks like a cup that could be used by you , me , any clumsy person , and that makes it much more comforting for them to use , to blend in .
so i thought , well , let 's observe him in his daily tasks , while he 's eating , while he 's watching tv .
`` so he took really long to reach this position , and then all this while , i 'm thinking , `` '' oh my god , is he really going to do it ? ''
so — shocked ?
( applause )
we live in an incredibly busy world .
you get stressed , you do some meditation .
we need an exercise .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself , and much more quickly than people had once realized , if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem .
they’re powerful tools for transformation , for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy , to be peaceful , to be joyful and to realize that it’s not something that you pursue and get , but rather it’s something that you have already until you disturb it .
and in our studies , what we’ve been able to do is to use very expensive , high-tech , state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost — and in many ways , ancient — interventions , can be .
clinically , he literally couldn’t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain ; within a month , like most people , was pain-free , and within a year , climbing more than 100 floors a day on a stairmaster .
this is not unusual , and it’s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes , because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life .
the younger brother is 86 , the older one’s 95 ; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were .
and what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease .
there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
the most effective anti-smoking ad was this one .
your sexual function improves .
for many people , those are choices worth making — not to live longer , but to live better .
two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese , and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years . it’s no joke : it’s real .
so , when you eat less fat , you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food .
but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat .
you find these , for example , in fish oil .
and so , you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you , but when they get too close it’s going to be a problem .
now , there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too , whether it’s the deforestation of the amazon , or making more protein available , to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day — not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have .
when we looked at their psa levels — which is a marker for prostate cancer — they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experimental group , and these differences were highly significant .
i worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder , eventually becoming a chief financial officer in silicon valley , a job i really enjoyed .
we were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , i suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect .
i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
with a little practice , i became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own .
i could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing .
all right , big finish .
( applause ) all right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but i think it shows the promise .
it is up to us , all of us , to decide how robotics will be used , for good or for evil , for simply replacing people or for making people better , for allowing us to do and enjoy more .

why consciousness ?
one feature is the tradition of religious dualism : consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
and i used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache .
two : well , maybe it exists , but it 's really something else .
it begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep , and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious .
okay , that 's the first feature of consciousness .
okay . another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields .
that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
how can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects ?
their existence is observer-relative .
well , some computations are intrinsic .
so it 's an obvious mistake . why did they make the mistake ?
( applause )
`` they have what i called `` '' logorrhea dementia , '' '' which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane . ''
i once — this was years ago — i saw ted kennedy and dan quayle meet in the well of the senate .
and they were friends , and they hugged each other and they were laughing , and their faces were like this far apart .
`` and he goes into the diner , introduces himself to a family and says , `` '' what village are you from in new hampshire ? '' '' and then he describes the home he owned in their village . ''
we sent economists in the soviet union with privatization plans when it broke up , and what they really lacked was social trust .
for 30 years , i 've been covering school reform and we 've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes — charters , private schools , vouchers — but we 've had disappointing results year after year .
we 're really good at talking about material things , but we 're really bad at talking about emotions .
babies flop out , they 're flashing mandarin flashcards at the things .
driving them home , and they want them to be enlightened , so they take them to ben & jerry 's ice cream company with its own foreign policy .
( laughter ) and as they whiz by you , it 's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill . ( laughter )
and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature , it 's a new humanism , it 's a new enchantment .
people with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they 're actually sometimes quite helpless .
( laughter ) this is a gender-linked trait , by the way .
it 's a sensitivity to the physical environment , the ability to pick out patterns in an environment — derive a gist .
he was married to a woman named carol , and they had a wonderful relationship .
and now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are , comes this revolution in consciousness — these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted , this new humanism .
when the government of egypt fell in 2011 , activists raided the office of the secret police , and among the many documents they found was this document by the gamma corporation , by gamma international .
gamma is a german company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments .
this is perhaps my favorite .
( video ) narrator : you want to look through your target 's eyes .
what i thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
they 're all buying off-the-shelf stuff .
thank you very much .
so there 's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong .
we have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things .
on the race car in front of you here there are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race .
it 's a huge amount of data .
it was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
this was a heart attack that no one could see coming .
and so we installed a real-time link between the ambulance and the hospital , just using normal 3g telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care .
we think that the race is on to do something differently .
so i 'm going to show you a few of the projects that i 've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems .
and you 'll see everybody waking up on the east coast , followed by european flights coming in the upper right-hand corner .
this is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
and you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
so now on to something completely different .
`` what does this mean for the future of mankind , where we 're all plugged into this borg ? '' '' i was probably being a little extreme . ''
so i created this drawing tool .
lots of sheep .
`` i expected people to be wondering , `` '' why did i draw a sheep ? '' '' and i think it 's a pretty valid question . ''
sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts , the first to be selectively bred for production traits , the first animal to be cloned .
so i thought this was an interesting clip to divide into 16 pieces and feed into the mechanical turk with a drawing tool .
we decided to use the mechanical turk for exactly what it was meant for , which is making money .
you 'd be fed a simple audio clip .
`` and this was seen by a director in l.a. named james frost who said , `` '' wait a minute . ''
and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers , but we also open sourced it , and we made it released as a google code project , where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .
more recently , somebody even 3d-printed thom yorke 's head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
`` and he ended up talking to rick rubin , who was finishing up johnny cash 's final album called `` '' ai n't no grave . '' '' the lyrics to the leading track are `` '' ai n't no grave can hold my body down . '' '' so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash . ''
( music ) ( video ) johnny cash : ♫ there ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ there ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ when i hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ i 'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body ... ♫ ( applause ) ak : what better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs .
collaborator three : for all of the frames to be drawn by fans , each individual frame , it 's got a very powerful feeling to it .
and in a weird way , that 's what i actually like about johnny cash 's music as well .
( laughter ) yeah .
this landscape was watered with treated sewage water .
`` i mean , i can use profane words like `` '' shit '' '' and `` '' piss , '' '' and then my grandma wo n't watch the video . ''
( laughter ) it 's all i got . ( laughs ) so , in this suburb , the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
but the most important thing about this system is n't the technicals of how it works .
why not ?
our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant .
the average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in .
boom ! healthier food .
now , some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle .
here 's an average house in portland , oregon .
here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach was the cheapest .
why ?
imagine if we embraced innovation for sanitation the way we have for , say , solar power .
think about it — solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable .
we now have sources of power like the sun that do n't vary with our earthly dramas .
`` every time you flush the toilet , i want you to think , `` '' where is my poop and pee going ? ''
`` will they be gainfully employed ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway ? '' ''
and if you do n't like the answer , figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced potty training , that you are ready for reuse .
that 's why today i want to highlight women of color in stem , who are inexorably , unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities .
my personal hope is that you 'll become an astrophysicist , but beyond that , anything you want .
hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you ca n't even imagine .
`` for me , it 's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you ca n't do every day . '' '' this shows exactly the power of a liminal person . ''
thus , we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience .
he believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution .
so i am here today because i think we need hackers , and in fact , they just might be the immune system for the information age .
i did n't really know what it did , but i copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that .
open sesame .
it 's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower , one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect , but thankfully no radioactive spiders .
but with great power comes great responsibility , and you all like to think that if we had such powers , we would only use them for good .
this is what khalil did .
unfortunately , due to some miscommunications , his report was not acknowledged .
this universal hacker movement needs no introduction today , but six years ago they were not much more than an internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and internet trolling campaigns .
the reality is , hackers can do a lot more than break things .
this took place in egypt in january 2011 , and as president hosni mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of cairo , he sent his personal troops down to egypt 's internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country 's connection to the world overnight .
they come from all walks of life , ethnicities , ideologies and genders , i might add .
perhaps like me , general alexander did n't see 12,000 criminals that day in vegas .
as an astrophysicist , i have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects in our universe .
some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet , shown here in white .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context .
as we more confidently localize where these gamma ray blobs are forming , we can better understand how jets are being accelerated , and ultimately reveal the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed .
a clue could be in this question we were asked 10 years ago .
we had to innovate .
we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house , and we went back to the families to do two things : join forces and split tasks .
it 's a collection of floors , one on top of each other , with a core in the center with elevators , stairs , pipes , wires , everything , and then a glass skin on the outside that , due to direct sun radiation , creates a huge greenhouse effect inside .
so we thought , well , maybe we have to turn this scheme inside out .
when you have an open atrium inside , you are able to see what others are doing from within the building , and you have a better way to control light , and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter , then you are preventing direct sun radiation .
you may also open those windows and get cross-ventilation .
none of this is rocket science .
thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation .
this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays , and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese , this may work , but we know that in chile , this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow , so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable .
second alternative : build a big wall , heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves .
vote for constitución .
go to the open house and express your options .
man : so why ca n't we have a concrete defense ?
man 2 : i am the history of constitución .
and my grandchildren and everyone else will .
what if , in between the city and the sea we have a forest , a forest that does n't try to resist the energy of nature , but dissipates it by introducing friction ?
the sum of them : 52 million dollars .
for one year , i would say yes to all the things that scared me .
i create television . i executive produce television .
`` a new episode made every nine days times four shows , so every nine days that 's 20 million dollars worth of television , four television programs , 70 hours of tv , three shows in production at a time , sometimes four , 16 episodes going on at all times : 24 episodes of `` '' grey 's , '' '' 21 episodes of `` '' scandal , '' '' 15 episodes of `` '' how to get away with murder , '' '' 10 episodes of `` '' the catch , '' '' that 's 70 hours of tv , that 's 350 million dollars for a season . ''
it 's all job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat , no tears .
i work a lot , very hard , and i love it .
for me , my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air .
the hum is more than writing .
the hum is god 's whisper right in my ear .
and when you have a hum like that , you ca n't help but strive for greatness .
i do n't know .
my hum was broken .
it was all i did .
and i 'm just about to say no , when i realize two things .
and it 's not instantaneous , but it happens , it does happen .
a hum creeps back .
well , let 's not get carried away .
the hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life .
( laughter ) and one of those issues is n't that i am too relaxed . ( laughter )
we run around the yard , up and back and up and back .
my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up .
15 minutes is all you need .
uninterrupted is the key .
just figure it out and play in that arena .
i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends .
i said yes to less work and more play , and somehow i still run my world .
alia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall .
there he exploded .
i presented a couple of gender parity indices , and some conclusions about the arab world .
i would lie if i said these words did n't hurt .
still today , the arab man is not an equal contributor in the home .
things are changing , but it will take time .
cristina had worked for four years with my sister and the quality of her work was well-established .
our son burhan is five years old , and he 's learning to read and do basic maths .
arab women , generally speaking , have not fallen for this psychological trap .
yet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women .
`` my hopes for my son are that by then , the expression `` '' her mother 's son '' '' or `` '' mama 's boy '' '' would have taken on a completely different meaning . ''
when i was little — and by the way , i was little once — my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels .
and this is n't a think , it 's a feel .
now i 'm not a neuroscientist .
i do n't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex .
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what i 'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking .
and when i looked at it first , i thought , no , there 's no beauty in that .
then i found out , post exposure , that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff , that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure , potable drinking water .
now i 'm going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
it 's the last thing she did , the last physical act .
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
there 's something weird happening .
and as we assemble these tools , from a design point of view , i get terribly excited about it , because these are things , as we 've already said , they 're arriving at the brain , it would seem , before cognition , before we can manipulate them — electrochemical party tricks .
it 's mediated by information before the comprehension .
well it obviously is n't .
so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
and i feel that here .
this bit , the big secret of automotive design — reflection management .
i ca n't tell you how wonderful this is .
why would you do that ?
`` they call him `` '' the plumber '' '' in italy , as well as `` '' maestro , '' '' because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time . ''
pretty ? yes .
and a focus group can not do it .
i might like it more than you like it , because i know how bloody hard it is to do it .
look at that . do you want to see it again ?
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we ca n't do this .
but how do you feel about it ?
they 're the things that you 'd snatch if the house was on fire .
thank you very much .
( applause )
hey guys .
who 's making these things ? how did they make them ?
because this is how reality is created .
`` and the creator of this , he said , `` this is fire . i call this fire . '' ''
`` he does n't know , but he can show you . '' '' so his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially when it comes to the human-made , human-built world . ''
we know how it 's supposed to work , so we ca n't suppose all the things that could be possible .
`` and so he 's like , `` '' okay , i 'll just mess around with this . '' '' this is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest . ''
and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body , it would connect two little pieces of copper tape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loop the same sounds over and over again .
and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let 's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
so i 'll just plug it in , and now it 's on by usb .
and now if i hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow , i 'm kind of programming it by where i hook it up , now i have a left arrow and a right arrow , so i should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards . awesome .
`` and so we 're like , `` '' we got ta put a video out about this . '' '' because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and , like , one other guy . ''
well , i think it 's cool , but we should be doing that stuff ourselves .
and so we put it up on kickstarter , and hundreds of people bought it in the first day .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums .
and this is fun , and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun ?
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
`` and i also put this little surprise . when you open the lid of the box , it says , `` '' the world is a construction kit . '' '' and as you start to mess around this way , i think that , in some small ways , you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with , and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works . ''
and so next time you 're on an escalator and you drop an m & m by accident , you know , maybe that 's an m & m surfboard , not an escalator , so do n't pick it up right away .
and that 's the world i really want to live in .
we have to admit that our performance is not great .
well , you can google , you can ebay , you can even alibaba .
so this can be used for making amazing things , like super-fabrics for industrial and medical applications .
and i 'm going to say that this is not a good idea .
so where is the problem ?
so that 's exactly what we did .
now , if you ever made a pesto — essentially , the same thing .
good afternoon .
so i 'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that i met outside , which i 'm now bringing inside .
the crazy teacher — that 's me on the left , i dress up pretty , thank you , my wife , i love you for getting a good suit — my passionate borough president and a guy named george irwin from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology .
but again , i am not a farmer . i 'm a teacher .
and i do n't like weeding , and i do n't like back-breaking labor .
`` so i call this `` '' from south bronx to southampton . '' '' and we started putting in roofs that look like this , and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this , wow ! people noticed . ''
so , you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids , besides changing landscapes and mindsets ?
wow ! people noticed . and notice they did .
but this is not a getty image .
that 's a picture i took of my bronx borough president , addressing my kids in his house , not the jailhouse , making them feel a part of it .
we are poised , ready , willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we 've never even imagined .
and what do you know ? six months later , my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment .
the poorest congressional district in america , the most migratory community in america , we can do this .
bissel gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions , moving kids into an economy they never imagined .
and behold the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
we 're also becoming children of the corn , creating farms in the middle of fordham road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage .
this is a beautiful moment .
they are now , my first cohort is all in college , earning a living wage .
but , understand this is my intellectual viagra .
so here in new york , i urge you , my fellow americans , to help us make america great again .
so here , and at a time when we 've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity , i urge you to do something . i urge you to do something .
it is n't just that . we 're seeing it all over the world .
so for example , we 're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter .
and that 's how powerful the one negative is .
so let me go forward to the new science of happiness .
we 've come away from the freudian gloom , and people are now actively studying this .
`` we use this word `` '' happy , '' '' and it 's this very large umbrella of a term . ''
we 're also born pleasure-seekers .
let 's just go into the brain for a moment , and see where does happiness arise from in evolution .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
and the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major .
and we imitate from almost the second we are born .
here is a three-week-old baby .
and that 's really mediated by the sex hormones .
the other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status .
you see mental distress going up with lower income .
and one of the problems with money is materialism .
what happens when people pursue money too avidly , is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life .
i had a very normal , low-key kind of upbringing .
`` years later , i was on my second teaching round in a melbourne high school , and i was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , `` hey miss , when are you going to start doing your speech ? '' ''
`` and he said , `` '' you know , like , your motivational speaking . ''
and in the past few years , we 've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media .
you know , you might have seen the one , the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth .
you might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs .
so in this case , we 're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people .
`` i could be that person . '' '' but what if you are that person ? ''
these images , those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people .
so i have lived in this body a long time .
they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary .
genius .
it makes life hard for us .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
invest sustainably .
there are 2.5 billion people around the world that do n't have a credit score .
loan sharks are always an option , but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent , they 're financially risky .
jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history .
and the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time .
in jenipher 's case , she communicated with 89 different individuals , which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment .
thank you .
it was the early '90s , and i was at a public event .
like this : agricultural workers in africa , whipped and beaten , showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew .
now , where is it ?
but if corruption creeps in and people do n't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with impunity , you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .
i just want to share a little clip for you .
so , that 's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on .
we 're not about to run out of people . no other commodity has that .
bl : daphne , if i may draw your attention to one thing .
the price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today 's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars .
or , we say , frederick douglass is in the house .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
`` they take their kids out of the workplace , they build a school , they say , `` '' we 're going to have stuff we 've never had before like three squares , medicine when we 're sick , clothing when we 're cold . '' '' they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly . ''
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped .
it 's just not going to happen .
if we do n't take action , we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy , and in our government policies .
for complicated reasons which i 'll get to later , when i look at this picture , at that time i felt like , geena , you 've done it , you 've made it , you have arrived .
i remember when i was five years old in the philippines walking around our house , i would always wear this t-shirt on my head .
gender has always been considered a fact , immutable , but we now know it 's actually more fluid , complex and mysterious .
so when i was eight years old , i was at a fiesta in the philippines celebrating these mysteries .
so from 15 to 17 years old , i joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it 's at the back of the truck , literally , or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field , and when it rains — it rains a lot in the philippines — the organizers would have to move it inside someone 's house .
she 's from new york , she 's a young woman who was courageously living her truth , but hatred ended her life .
this is marsha p. johnson and sylvia rivera .
i could no longer live my truth for and by myself .
i want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror .
i 'm wondering what you would say , especially to parents , but in a more broad way , to friends , to family , to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that 's being assigned them , what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them ?
( applause )
they started dreaming about the decorations , invitations , the dresses they were going to wear , and what their fathers could and could not wear . ( laughter ) it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes , but even if i could have slowed down those girls , i would n't have , because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need .
as long as they have infrastructure , mentorship and resources , they can build what they need , not only to survive , but to thrive .
they really enjoyed each other 's company .
`` that 's worse than not having him here at all . '' '' at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes . ''
`` who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up — `` '' ( laughter ) `` — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits ? '' ''
because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .
`` i 'll never forget that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said , `` daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? '' ''
because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
♫ we will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ in lackluster ♫ ♫ in dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we 've got ♫ ♫ everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ and what of the wretched hollow ? ♫ ♫ the endless in between ? ♫ ♫ are we just going to wait it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ wait it out ♫
oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell rings .
social lines are barbed wire .
anyway , the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century , apart from it 's going to happen to everybody , is it 's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us , unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it 's currently on .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s when i met this guy .
his is the little hand .
you can see his bones through the skin .
so a group of us started doing survey work , and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle , in the newcastle area , and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating .
how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us , and the stress created in families by dying is enormous , and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else , so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you 've got a choice .
the death of little nell and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just does n't happen anymore .
what can i say that 's positive ? what 's positive is that this is happening at very great age , now .
we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die , and what would they prefer under those circumstances .
i suggested we should have occupy death .
i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia , not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all .
in system d , this is a store , and what i mean by that is that this is a photograph i took in makoko , shantytown in lagos , nigeria .
it 's built over the lagoon , and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop , and so the store comes to you .
`` ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in lagos , and i asked her , `` '' where does the fish come from ? '' '' and i thought she 'd say , `` '' oh , you know , up the lagoon somewhere , or maybe across africa , '' '' but you 'll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea . ''
this is oshodi market in lagos .
so , what am i talking about when i talk about system d ?
there 's a word in french that is débrouillardise , that means to be self-reliant , and the former french colonies have turned that into system d for the economy of self-reliance , or the diy economy .
it 's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year , and that 's a vast amount of money , right ?
we only sell you airtime .
and where do the phones come from ?
now , are there downsides to that ?
zhuomani instead of armani .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it 's wrong of us to blame — and i 'm not singling out siemens , i 'm saying everyone does it . okay ?
and third is , and i 'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg , that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency , alternate currencies are also very important , and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks .
and b , i hate them and i 'm terrified of the power they hold .
i wanted my monument to live in the world , and to circulate .
the lines of the paper , when magnified , are revealed to be micro-printed text that contains the details , the names , the dates and locations of individual iraqi civilians that died .
there 's an envelope .
the paper you 're holding in your hand contains the details of iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
one fifth of all living mammals is a bat , and they have very unique attributes .
bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this .
if anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in australia , you 've seen them coming out of the botanic gardens in sydney , and if you just look at their face , you can see they have much , much larger eyes and much smaller ears .
now , if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you , and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats , that 's probably not that surprising , because here in western culture , bats have been demonized .
`` the chinese word for `` '' bat '' '' sounds like the chinese word for `` '' happiness , '' '' and they believe that bats bring wealth , health , longevity , virtue and serenity . ''
without them , it 's going to be a problem .
so in this case here , if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow-type genome at that site , it probably suggests that purple is bad .
this could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently .
again , there 's many underlying genetic causes for this .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
but what would be so amazing about this ?
well , typically , in mammals there is a relationship between body size , metabolic rate , and how long you can live for , and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size .
his grandfather died when he was only 10 .
he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect , the way of life they needed to nurture .
some did , not everybody .
but he was n't dismayed .
`` if you were to meet benki and ask him , `` '' why are you doing this ? ''
we 're running out of fresh water .
we 're running out of land .
but for the past eight years , i 've done something completely different .
they take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around karnataka .
but he saw the work , the care , the compassion that sanghamitra and her team brought to the village , and he wanted to be part of it .
they 've gone away from what they did before , and they 've gone to something they did n't know .
but we know it does n't just happen , do n't we ?
and we know , just like they knew , how hard it is .
we can learn from what they 've learned .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
and if we look where the income ends up , this is 100 percent the world 's annual income .
so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
there 's now ample evidence that hardy rodenstock is a con man , and that the jefferson bottles were fakes .
i became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
it 's in the smell .
these white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
there were several — several of these items were disappointments .
it has four balconies .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
these ones gq did spring for — i own these — but i will tell you , not only did i not get a compliment from any of you , i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these .
it was very green , it was very peppery .
( laughter ) a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan — you 'll start to notice .
it 's a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations .
that 's right .
i do n't think it 's that bad of a deal .
and just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following .
what there is of it left you do n't know if it 's real — it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world .
and it was an invitation you do not refuse .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
a lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more — it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive .
`` and now comes the hardest part : we have to go talk to her parents . '' '' at that time , a thousand questions came to mind , from , `` '' how could a one-month-old baby be so unfortunate ? '' '' to , `` '' could we have done something about it ? '' '' before vaccines existed , many infectious diseases killed millions of people per year . ''
they 'd put little bags of camphor in their children 's underwear , as if that could do something .
vaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet and succeeded in significantly reducing mortality due to other diseases such as measles , whooping cough , polio and many more .
i would like you to pay attention to something .
they are our parents , our siblings , our acquaintances , who may have a disease , or take medication that lowers their defenses .
to achieve this effect of herd immunity , it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated .
if the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community is below this threshold number , the disease will begin to spread more freely and may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community .
people died of measles .
the patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter , with longer fevers .
a marathon work .
sol had whooping cough .
the thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture — i suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others i 'm going to show you .
the whole thing about this , though , is that , you know , why am i showing it ?
i think one of the things i am passionate about , my grandparents work , i 'm passionate about my work , but on top of all that i 'm passionate about a holistic vision of design , where design is a life skill , not a professional skill .
i 'm no exception .
and this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation .
and charles just checking it out there .
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
`` some of them are kind of cool looking . it 's like `` '' hey , why did n't they try that ? '' '' it was that hands-on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures . ''
because it just kind of , you know , does n't get any more basic than that .
`` it worked better : `` '' h '' '' base , much more practical . ''
charles and ray , they did n't obsess about style for it 's own sake .
`` they did n't say , `` '' our style is curves . let 's make the house curvy . '' '' they did n't say , `` '' our style is grids . let 's make the chair griddy . '' '' they focused on the need . ''
`` charles used to say , `` '' the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . '' '' it 's kind of a brutal quote . ''
`` if we watch the next clip , you 're going to see the first version of `` '' powers of ten , '' '' upper left . ''
it was part of the quality of life .
but anyway , ( laughter ) i remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the eames house when i was a kid .
also , what is he doing ? row , rowed .
dawn , very good .
`` so , `` '' i saw many trains and also rode on one . ''
and so we had spelling bees in paris , illinois .
and you 're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .
but now i 'm going to return you to the real world .
and he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .
at the same time that charles was doing that chair , he was doing this film .
so we 're going to do the last clip .
but it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf .
and i also want to share this one .
( applause )
because a cave landscape , like this deep shaft in italy , is hidden , the potential of cave exploration — the geographical dimension — is poorly understood and unappreciated .
caves form in karstic regions .
these mountains contain also a scientific paradox : they are made by quartz , which is a very common mineral on the earth 's crust , and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite , and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth .
despite this , in the last 10 years , speleologists from italy , slovakia , czech republic , and , of course , venezuela and brazil , have explored several caves in this area .
so you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis ' surfaces , but also to open the fractures and form stone cities , rock cities , fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis .
but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame .
and it 's a huge network of underground rivers , channels , big rooms , extremely deep shafts .
when you enter a quartzite cave , you have to completely forget what you know about caves — classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world .
we were the first entering and discovering those unknown things , things like those monster eggs .
( laughter ) anyway , actually , we know that this kind of formation , after several studies , we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms .
bg : in principle . fs : yes .
maybe we can try this at home someday , i do n't know .
we had the first world war , the great depression , the second world war and the rise of the communist nations .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
communication walls , i do n't have to tell you — the internet — have come tumbling down .
india , starting a little bit later , but in 1990 , begetting tremendous growth .
now africa , sub-saharan africa — sub-saharan africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth .
on the cutting edge today it 's new ideas which are driving growth .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
well how else can we create new ideas ?
globalize trade .
a large fraction of those people are in the united states .
but it is going to happen in this century .
africa is coming on line .
1500 to 1800 : maybe a little bit of economic growth , but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today .
that 's not that far .
what about a great depression ?
what would you have predicted , not knowing this ?
in fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the 20th century .
alright . what else ?
`` so people were asking a question . they were saying , `` is china drinking our milkshake ? '' ''
now remember here what jefferson said .
thank you .
by the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
`` so , before i got here , i thought , `` '' you know , i am from north america . ''
and if you can cause that coil to resonate , what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies — at a fairly high frequency , by the way .
think about it . you do n't want those ugly cords coming down .
imagine if you can get rid of it .
so , i wanted to show you something .
it 's odd . it has a battery .
( applause ) and nokia as well .
we 've evolved with tools , and tools have evolved with us .
these sculpting tools have evolved through their use , and each one has a different form which matches its function .
and they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision .
but as tools have become more and more complex , we need more complex controls to control them .
however , computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well .
and now you can walk around it , but it 's dynamic , it 's physical , and you can also interact directly .
and so you can also bring in existing objects , and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other .
( laughter ) but anyway , i think that we were really excited by the things that inform allowed us to do .
but again , they have the same static physical form for each of these applications .
or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration .
so you can make something like a game controller , and then the system will understand what shape it 's in and change to that mode .
and so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically , and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks ?
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
late at night , after hours of practicing , i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents ' stereo .
his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
the excitement from using multi-tracking , the way i did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source .
i live in south central .
i mean , come on , why would n't they ?
you 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
you just could n't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
this is on the street for a reason .
that 's why it 's on the street .
that 's the whole idea .
and when we do this , who knows ?
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
no , no , no , no . better — to live of cooked food .
it 's technology .
i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing , the continuation of the unleashing of human potential .
the brain could grow , but the gut actually shrunk .
okay , it 's not obvious to be honest .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
and now this brain takes care over this , to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and , of course , digest our food we cook .
it senses the food ; it knows exactly what to do .
this control of muscle is very , very important , because , you know , there can be reflexes .
the lower layer , our gut brain , has its own goals — digestion defense — and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors .
at least in my case , they are not listened to .
how can we cook that we have this language developed ?
so what we have actually , it 's not an omnivore 's dilemma .
and i want to tell you about a project to save plants .
and the way that you save plants is by storing seeds .
because seeds , in all their diverse glory , are plants ' futures .
and those are the dry land species .
it means negotiating with heads of state , and with secretaries of state in 50 countries to sign treaties .
and they collect the seeds . all over the world .
and the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully , at low temperature .
so where have we got to ?
twenty-five percent of all the world 's plants , by 2020 .
fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine .
( applause )
then of course , at the dawn of aviation , all of the great inventors of the time — like hargreaves , like langley , even alexander graham bell , inventor of the telephone , who was flying this kite — were doing so in the pursuit of aviation .
and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion , where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight .
that was until the 1970s , where we had the last energy crisis .
i 'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child 's favorite plaything .
so we 're beyond the 12-second steps .
that would be enough to power your cell phone .
if you give me a 747 , i 'll make six megawatts , which is more than the largest wind turbines today .
by 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
you can deploy power in a wide range of ways .
at the beginning of the bush administration , when president bush , now president bush , was running for president , he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol , for example .
`` now , the reason i begin by saying `` '' no 9/11 , no war '' '' is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks — the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks — and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we 're about to be engaged in . ''
now , how is islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus ?
it 's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer , but it 's also meant by the islamists — and i use that term to mean people who believe that islam — they follow the slogan , islam is the answer to a wide range of questions , whether they 're social , or political , or personal , or spiritual .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
`` these are contested points , and it 's impossible to answer them by saying , `` ah ha , i looked in the right place , and i found out what these concepts mean . '' ''
now , during the cold war , that may have been a defensible position for the united states to take .
in the most recent elections in the muslim world — which are those in pakistan , those in morocco and those in turkey — in each case , people who present themselves to the electorate as islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote-getters every place they were allowed to run freely .
so had they contested a larger number of the seats , they would have done even better .
now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world .
what does it mean to say that there 's an islamic democracy ?
it will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room , or muslims out in the rest of the world — i do n't mean to imply there are n't muslims here , there probably are — conceptualize islam .
and as a result of this convergence , this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together , there 's a real possibility that , instead of a clash of islamic civilization — if there is such a thing — and democratic civilization — if there is such a thing — we 'll in fact have close compatibility .
on the other hand , there 's a further possibility that many americans , swept up in the fever of a war , will say , and feel , and think that islam is the enemy somehow — that islam ought to be construed as the enemy .
and it is crucial — it is crucial in a practical , activist way — for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their preferences , their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome .
i 'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder , but this is not how i started .
`` this is me , the little one , and i know what you 're thinking : `` you used to look cute , what the heck happened to you ? '' ''
he was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones , and as a result , had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison .
i am very , very happy to be amidst some of the most — the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses .
the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa is a place of despair .
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa , from a challenge of despair , which is called poverty reduction , to a challenge of hope .
wealth is a function of income , and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job .
but what is the international aid community doing with africa today ?
by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms ?
does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another ?
under the cotonou agreement , formerly known as the lome convention , african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods , duty-free , to the european union market .
how do we begin to do that , and why is aid the bad instrument ?
you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .
why should people support their government ?
we have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune .
but i want to put a caveat on my argument , and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive .
it may have built a road , and that road may have served a very good role .
the mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success , generalize them , pour billions and trillions of dollars into them , and then spread them across the whole world , ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village , the skills , the practices , the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed — like in sauri village , in kenya , where jeffrey sachs is working — and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody .
uganda 's recurrent expenditure — by recurrent what do i mean ?
one hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies , all of which have directors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addressed to mr. bono . in his work , he may help us on this .
uganda has 961 sub-counties , each of them with a dispensary , none of which has an ambulance .
so , the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers , the permanent secretaries , the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects , while the poor die without ambulances and medicine .
( applause )
`` there 's a paul newman movie that i love called `` '' the verdict . '' '' i do n't know how many of you have seen it , but it 's a beaut . ''
and george wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater , and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive .
i still work for the public theater .
the best way to accomplish serious design — which i think we all have the opportunity to do — is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job .
and then i found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor , so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense .
this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , made out of completely inexpensive materials .
things i never did before , built before .
and then , inexpensive signage .
it will change every six months , and it will become an art installation in the north side of pittsburgh , and it will probably become a landmark in the area .
every single city of the united states is on here .
this is a print from the united states which we did in red , white and blue .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree — which produced this painting — moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
you might have a guess .
you run through a quick mental checklist .
is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
next , i 'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found .
just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information , and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places , like right now , i 'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active .
now all these regions i 've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception .
do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy , complicated mental processes ?
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
it 's early days in this enterprise .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat .
it mainly uses one cell type , and it is largely two-dimensional .
it 's natural connective tissue .
it allows us to be creative .
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
`` `` '' where are you from ? '' '' said the pale , tattooed man . `` where are you from ? '' ''
10 days after the worst attack on america since world war ii .
he senses he is dying .
his landlord , the mini-mart owner , kicked him out .
soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt , including a fee for dialing for an ambulance .
i became a writer and found myself amid a magical story : the awakening of hope across much of the so-called third world .
metal peppered his face .
( laughter ) now , as a devout muslim , he refused alcohol , did n't touch the stuff .
sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents ' , tenderly feeding horses .
he read viktor frankl , the holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos .
he wanted her , too , to have a second chance .
an affluent secession of up , up and away , into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work , money and connections , and an impoverished secession of down and out into disconnected , dead-end lives that the fortunate scarcely see .
it is a moral challenge that begs each of us in the flourishing america to take on the wilting america as our own , as raisuddin tried to do .
what can we do ? how might we build a more merciful country ? we , the greatest inventors in the world ,
we , the writers and the journalists , can cover that america 's stories , instead of shutting down bureaus in its midst .
i get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores .
so i 'm going to show you exactly what i brought .
exactly one week 's worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
and since you do n't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear — ( laughter ) that means i found a few things .
and i 'd really love to show you my week 's worth of outfits right now .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
( laughter ) if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
i 've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man , because i absolutely hate waste .
the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something .
and of course , it 's your stuff if it 's broken .
because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff .
now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world — well less than one percent .
and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
i call this environmental arbitrage .
we have enormous energy savings .
and they get to make more sustainable products .
we 're sieving the material , we 're using magnets , we 're using air classification .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
we blend it in 50,000-lb . blending silos .
we push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
and we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
( applause )
music goes straight to the emotional vein , into your bloodstream and right into your heart .
( laughter ) here 's me , just so we 're even .
( laughter ) these experiments grew , and in time , started to look more like this .
but it was n't quite enough .
and after years of searching , i found a prototype .
virtual reality bridges that gap .
in all other mediums , your consciousness interprets the medium .
but where are we now ?
we found that we have a unique , direct path into your senses , your emotions , even your body .
you feel triumphant for jr 's character .
we started in caves , then moved to clans and tribes , then villages and towns , and now we 're all global citizens .
eventually , we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed , and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose .
what do we call it then ?
please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones .
sometimes i think we are the ones in charge .
they spoke with a passion , an urgency , an intellectual conviction that , for me , was a voice i had not heard in decades , a dream long forgotten .
we have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature .
subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces , with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure .
at the same time , all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda , darfur , myanmar .
bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives .
the importance of coming to grips with values like justice , equity , truth , becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone can not tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education , our approach to health , or strategies for achieving an economics of equity .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provides a lot of company .
you are not the first to try to figure this out , just as you are unlikely to be the last .
`` the more powerful our reach , the more important the question `` '' about what ? '' '' when improvisation , resourcefulness , imagination are key , artists , at long last , take their place at the table , when strategies of action are in the process of being designed . ''
social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good .
this discovery is transforming .
i 'm afraid i 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at ted .
secondly , a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
and according to the surveys , we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world .
but then the rain stopped , people went to vote .
because you know what to do about the protests .
democracy is the only game in town .
and i 'll start with what went right .
`` and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : `` the government does not know better . '' ''
and of course , you have 1989 — the end of communism , the end of the cold war .
and this is not the audience to which i 'm going to preach to what extent the internet empowered people .
so this is what went right .
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand .
now we have the reverse tendency .
`` and if you go to 1989 — something that basically you do n't expect that anybody 's going to criticize — but many are going to tell you , `` '' listen , it was the end of the cold war that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in western europe . '' '' when the soviet union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them . ''
and when you go to the brain sciences , what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is do n't talk to me about ideas anymore , do n't talk to me about policy programs .
transparency is politics ' management of mistrust .
and by the way , mistrust was always very important for democracy .
but is this the idea of a free society ?
for example , can you imagine that decent , civic , talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust ?
so for me this is extremely important .
[ regardless of ] how transparent our governments want to be , they 're going to be selectively transparent .
thank you very much .
( applause )
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it , and we have to admit that .
the first thing is that the big myth , number one , is that in fact it 's not really a crime .
we 're coming out today from trinidad and tobago , a resource-rich , small caribbean country , and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country 's wealth , and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices .
as we say , it 's a nancy-story . forget it .
four months ago , we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country .
they are the piarco airport accused .
most importantly , the american embassy complained , so parliament was swiftly reconvened , and the law was reversed , it was repealed .
but the point is that parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events , because what really happened is that , because of the suspicious passage of that law , the law was actually passed into effect on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence , our jubilee of independence .
i 'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there . what were they accused of ?
it was autumn . it was cool . it was damp . it was getting dark .
and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street , occupy wall street movement walking around .
and there was a lady with a sign , a very simple sign , a kind of battered-looking blonde lady , and the sign was made out of bristol board , as we say in these parts , and it was made with a marker .
only here . so what was the reason for the generosity ?
question number one : i asked to see the accounts of cl financial , and if you ca n't show me the accounts — the minister of finance is making statements , passing new laws and giving speeches and so on .
what are the figures he 's relying on ?
let me pause here to point out to you all that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this .
that is about three and a half billion u.s. dollars coming out of a small — we used to be resource-rich — caribbean country . okay ?
there 's a particular individual who is in the government now .
and he was able to get the court , using that act of parliament , freedom of information act , to release the information , and i thought that was excellent .
we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation 's interest .
so here we have it . we have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded .
we will continue to press on .
the final thing i want to say is in relation to this one , which is a lovely website from india called ipaidabribe.com .
i want to warn you about that .
so , i do want to say , at the outset , that i think compassion 's great .
and i think it 's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths .
and the basic idea of kin selection is that , if an animal feels compassion for a close relative , and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative , then , in the end , the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself .
the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family .
that 's just human nature .
it 's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic .
the bad news is this does n't bring us universal compassion by itself .
so , there 's still work to be done .
that 's close to being a kind of built-in intuition .
so , we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated .
now , we have a rationale for that .
`` they would n't want to have missiles fired at them , but they say , `` '' well , but the israelis , or some of them have done things that put them in a special category . '' '' the israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them , but they impose one on gaza , and they say , `` well , the palestinians , or some of them , have brought this on themselves . '' ''
so , the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not , by itself , going to bring us universal love .
so , what do those terms mean ?
that 's the story of civilization .
if your fortunes are interdependent with somebody , then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them .
you saw it with the recent economic crash , where bad things happen in the economy — bad for everybody , for much of the world .
if they get less and less happy , that will be bad for americans .
so , we need to be aware of what kind of signals we 're sending out .
this is not the same as compassion , but it 's conducive to compassion . it opens the channels for compassion .
`` has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly '' '' ? ''
and , similarly , the person in iran : when you try to humanize somebody in america who said that islam is evil , they 'll have trouble with that .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
this is a virtual radius , not reality ; the black hole has no size .
and it 's actually quite a useful concept , because it tells us not only when a black hole will form , but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole .
almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
and all the light that we see from a typical galaxy , which is the kind of galaxies that we 're seeing here , comes from the light from the stars .
now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
and we call them active galactic nuclei .
in fact , in a few examples it 's like the ones that we 're seeing here .
and over the course of this experiment , these stars have moved a tremendous amount .
but with this experiment , we 've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that 's 10,000 times smaller .
i have told you my job is to get it down to the schwarzchild radius .
and the truth is , i 'm not quite there .
so , what i want to tell you , very briefly , is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at least we believe , that there is a supermassive black hole there .
you should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
the old ones are red .
we do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere , and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
so , we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting .
five years ago , 135 million children were born — so , more — and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five .
and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs : vaccines that were used more widely .
now , ironically , what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones , which is where the rich countries are .
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
it 's great to see .
but we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
so we 're going to have these new tools .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
and if you look at the economy , it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
that means that if the entire u.s. , for two years , had top quartile teachers , the entire difference between us and asia would go away .
within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away .
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
the variation is very , very small .
you might think these are people with master 's degrees .
now , the way the pay system works is there 's two things that are rewarded .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
but , overwhelmingly , it 's your past performance .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
`` they 're taking data , the test scores , and saying to a teacher , `` '' hey , you caused this amount of increase . '' '' they 're deeply engaged in making teaching better . ''
`` what 's going on ? '' '' and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids were n't paying attention , which kids were bored , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board . ''
it was a very dynamic environment , because particularly in those middle school years — fifth through eighth grade — keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention , nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who does n't want to be there .
and so kipp is doing it .
but i 'm optimistic about this , i think there are some clear things we can do .
and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
so it 's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things , get other people involved — and you 're helping to come up with solutions .
( applause )
then , i do n't look it , but i was the indian national squash champion for three years .
it changed my life .
mother went into a coma .
i went to this village for the first time .
you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
a professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
and no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
that is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
`` so when i said that , they said , `` '' well show us what is possible . what are you doing ? ''
they got the aga khan award for architecture in 2002 .
60 percent of children do n't go to school , because they have to look after animals — sheep , goats — domestic chores .
every five years we have an election .
puppets is the way we communicate .
he 's my donor .
`` and we went to ladakh , and we asked this woman — this , at minus 40 , you have to come out of the roof , because there 's no place , it was all snowed up on both sides — and we asked this woman , `` '' what was the benefit you had from solar electricity ? '' '' and she thought for a minute and said , `` it 's the first time i can see my husband 's face in winter . '' ''
`` i said , `` '' yeah , she is very beautiful . '' '' `` what happens if she runs off with an indian man ? '' ''
`` and when i went back six months later , i said , `` '' where 's your husband ? '' '' `` oh , somewhere . it does n't matter . '' ''
and i could show you equivalent pictures from other disease : multiple sclerosis , motor neuron disease , parkinson 's disease , even huntington 's disease , and they would all tell a similar story .
i mean , just think about that .
and that 's evident here with the slower conduction .
and if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve , for example , you 'll get motor neuron disease .
john : what i 've got now is the breathing 's gotten worse .
and there 's hope in this next section , of this brain section of somebody else with m.s. , because what it illustrates is , amazingly , the brain can repair itself .
but crucially , the area that 's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue .
and in order to do that , you have to think , where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery ?
take a skin cell , make it a master pluripotent cell , so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease , both to study but potentially to treat .
now , the idea of that at medical school — this is a recurring theme , is n't it , me and medical school ? — would have been ridiculous , but it 's an absolute reality today .
so to return to the original problem , what is the opportunity of these stem cells , or this disruptive technology , for repairing the damaged brain , which we call regenerative neurology ?
all of us have stem cells in the brain , even the diseased brain , and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it .
but the other way is to effectively parachute in cells , transplant them in , to replace dying or lost cells , even in the brain .
so i just want to end with the theme i began on , which was regeneration and hope .
so let me start by taking you back , back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life , but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history : the year 2000. remember that ?
some people do n't . and if we like them , we 've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward .
anyway , for now , anyone involved in getting these results , thank you . i think this proved these goals are worth it .
still , 7.6 million children die every year of preventable , treatable diseases , and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting , a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment .
well , as we gather here in edinburgh , technocrats appointed by the u.n. and certain governments , with the best intentions , are busying themselves designing a new package of goals , and currently they 're doing that through pretty much the same old late-20th-century , top-down , elite , closed process .
i mean , would n't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this , given that we can ?
so , if you 're with me , i 'd say there 's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign : collecting , connecting and committing .
and then we 've got to connect with the big crowd .
if we have this collected data , and this connected crowd , based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit , i think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations .
`` and ushahidi , which means `` '' witness '' '' in swahili , which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses . ''
our world leaders , our global politics , currently ca n't get it done .
it was a naive thought in many people 's minds , and it 's true , it was just a t-shirt slogan that worked for the moment . but look .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) chris anderson : jamie , here 's the puzzle to me .
jamie drummond : fewer children every day .
jd : it does , and we 're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels , for example , and aid alone is not the whole solution . nobody thinks it is .
if those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments , i know for a fact we 'd get better policy .
by which this might happen .
jd : absolutely . ca : all right , well i must say , if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea , that 's a huge idea , and if you carry that forward , that is really awesome , so thank you . jd : i 'd love your help .
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
then where do you go ?
it should n't take away from other things .
the r & d piece — it 's crazy how little it 's funded .
the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life ; that we can do good things , that there are things worth doing because they 're good things to do , and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them .
so david and i decided to go find out , through the best research we could muster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .
so , we 're real , and we 've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls .
girl 2 : divorced — parents divorced , maybe .
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy , you would think that girls ' games were kinda sissy .
nakilia invited reuben too , but — rockett : but what ? is n't he coming ?
rockett : really ? what other party ?
i could get invited to that party any day if i wanted to .
we love them .
it turns out they 're really great .
bl : thanks .
i realized that success is a moment , but what we 're always celebrating is creativity and mastery .
she first hit a seven , i remember , and then a nine , and then two tens , and then the next arrow did n't even hit the target .
and i saw that gave her more tenacity , and she went after it again and again .
`` the paris review got it out of james baldwin when they asked him , `` what do you think increases with knowledge ? '' ''
it 's jackie joyner-kersee , who in 1984 missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second , and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition .
even if we created utopias , i believe we would still have the incomplete .
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so i 'm going to dive straight in , right at the point where i get this thing to work .
i 'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
and of course , the last thing i 'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension .
so i 'm going to start with why we should .
ok. hands up : anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
that 's very good news , because i thought that was what the answer would be .
i mean , i know i 'm with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .
there are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too — well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .
and you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
what 's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
i 'm now going to talk about feasibility .
and the reason it 's the wrong answer is because of progress .
fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it 's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .
i 'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
and the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
you wo n't be able to withstand them .
so this is a genuine conclusion that i come to , that the first 150-year-old — we do n't know how old that person is today , because we do n't know how long it 's going to take to get these first-generation therapies .
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit .
and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday .
and thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
one has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we 're born .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
the point about this slide is actually the bottom .
but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete — this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology .
and there are only seven of them .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too .
so , you know , you 've got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
`` one thing is , you know , you 'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time , and everyone said , `` '' well , it 's obviously impossible . '' '' and you know what happened . ''
( laughter ) ag : because i am an old man . i am actually 158 . ( laughter )
so , to the extent that evolution does n't matter , does n't care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there 's a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that 's why there are no immortal species .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
ag : there are technical implications certainly .
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
i am also autistic .
for instance , my little brother , he 's very severely autistic .
but i love to talk .
people are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box with really specific labels .
( laughter ) one of the things i can do because i 'm autistic — it 's an ability rather than a disability — is i 've got a very , very vivid imagination .
( laughter ) also , when my imagination takes hold , my body takes on a life of its own .
what does it mean ?
i 'm going to leave you with one question : if we ca n't get inside the person 's minds , no matter if they 're autistic or not , instead of punishing anything that strays from normal , why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination ?
eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in .
and here 's the worst news of all .
that their parents be less tired and less stressed .
david is a software engineer . eleanor takes care of their four children , ages 10 to 15 .
instead of turning to friends or relatives , they looked to david 's workplace .
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door .
so the starrs , in adapting this to their home , created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores .
you know , the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves , and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids .
you know , greet five visitors at the door this week , get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed .
so what did we learn ?
plank number one : adapt all the time .
we ca n't . what 's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what 's happening to you in real time .
it 's like they say in the internet world : if you 're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago , you 're doing the wrong thing .
`` but to me , `` '' adapt all the time '' '' means something deeper , too . ''
let 's just take a few examples .
`` if you 're sitting on a cushioned chair , you 'll be more open . '' '' she told me , `` '' when you 're discipling your children , sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface . ''
so move where you sit . that 's adaptability .
so plank number one : adapt all the time .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family .
`` so we said , `` '' okay , give us a reward and give us a punishment . okay ? '' '' so one of my daughters threw out , you get five minutes of overreacting time all week . ''
there 's plenty of parental authority going on .
just as i was leaving to come here tonight , one of my daughters started screaming .
`` the other one said , `` '' overreaction ! overreaction ! '' '' and started counting , and within 10 seconds it had ended . ''
i made popcorn . actually , i burned one , so i made two .
and we had this great conversation , like , what 's important to us ?
`` researchers at emory gave children a simple `` '' what do you know '' '' test . ''
so my final plank is , tell your story .
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it 's something we make .
and it finally happened , so ...
preston reed : it 's mind-blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored .
and if it goes horribly wrong , no worries .
what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture .
what 's interesting about architects is , we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature , and arguably , beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature .
in the 15th century , the decimal point was invented ; architects stopped using fractions , and they had a new model of nature .
frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall .
so , what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations , instead of having a thumb , you would either get another opposable thumb , or you would get four fingers .
to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus : the fact that they 're calculus-based means that we do n't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements .
now , typically you 'd think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension .
so , these are the different perspectives of that interior , which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form .
so , every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building .
so they have to also discriminate between these products .
so , as manufacturing starts to allow more design options , this problem gets exacerbated , of the whole and the parts .
architects tend to work with signature , so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to , say , skyscrapers , and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with ; and intricacy , which is the relationship of , say , the shape of a building , its structure , its windows , its color , its pattern . these are real architectural problems .
i work with a group of other architects .
we have a company called united architects .
we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
`` there is a book written called , `` '' what 's the matter with kansas ? '' '' but really the question here — obama did relatively well in kansas . ''
but yeah , what 's the matter with arkansas ?
we know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people .
they asked this question .
`` we 're looking for people that said , `` '' yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , '' '' and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone . ''
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
same is true with , i think , all of these states you see on the top of the list .
so it 's the combination of these two things : it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we 'll talk about more in a moment .
and they ask a series of really interesting questions .
there is a big difference .
so if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races .
especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
and as a result it 's a very tolerant community , which is different , i think , than something like this , which is in schaumburg , illinois , where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through starbucks and stuff like that .
but also here is another idea we have — is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .
( applause )
we 've got some of the most incredible video of titanic that 's ever been seen , and we 're not going to show you any of it .
we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world .
these are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature .
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this .
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space , that micro-gravity environment that we really have n't explored .
and then one of my favorites . what a face !
they do n't catch them in a net .
and we 're over the atlantic — that 's the ridge right there — but we 're going to go across the caribbean , central america , and end up against the pacific , nine degrees north .
this is an icon of our robot , jason , it 's called .
we see it either as sound , or we see it as video , or we see it as photographs , or we see it as chemical sensors , but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture .
the pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch .
dg : you can see , here 's a crab that lives down there .
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he 'll bat it away with his claw . whack !
( laughter ) and the same thing 's going on over here .
here 's a tiny , little vent that 's come out of the side of that pillar .
now here 's a closer view of that community .
i just ca n't get over this — that you 've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away .
you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean , and it 's coming out all from it .
and animals are thriving — and we probably came from here .
their plumbing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
i 'll end up with saying one thing .
it 's an incredible story .
`` and what we 're learning now is that you ca n't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony , get to today and say , `` stop ! we want tomorrow 's note to be the same as it was today . '' ''
conservation 's tougher , but we can probably get there .
six years ago , after 20 years in graphic design and typography , i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work , with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved .
these days , i call myself a graphic artist .
the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .
`` and `` '' does it invoke curiosity ? '' '' this is a scientific diagram , by the way . ''
so this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something 's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will .
and eventually i used this technique to create a piece of artwork .
`` and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book , `` things in my life i 've learned so far . '' ''
and this is for a chapter that i 'm doing in a book , and the chapter is on honor .
so i 'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force .
there 's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content .
and this is it — just to give you and me a moment to catch up .
and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person .
i was very busy in the beginning of that year , and i did n't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine .
there 's a longer story to this , but i did get them all done in time , and they were extremely well received .
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was .
i 'm certain i can see you blushing .
but i really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
that 's caused a literal revolution , and it 's opened us up to a new experimental preparation . neurobiologists , as you well know , have lots of experimental preps , worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this .
cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago .
well , you ca n't compare oranges to windshields .
let me just give you a few examples . so here 's a baby .
`` here 's another couple . ( laughter ) and i 'm thinking i 'm not seeing love and admiration on the left . ( laughter ) in fact , i know this is his sister , and you can just see him saying , `` '' okay , we 're doing this for the camera , and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face . '' '' ( laughter ) he 'll kill me for showing that . ''
all right , so what does this mean ?
what do people do ? people are indifferent at an 80-20 split .
this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world .
like a job interview . you sit across the desk from somebody , they have some prior image of you , you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be .
when methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would — so it acted as an early warning system : hey , get out of the mine . things are n't going so well .
people come to the table , and even these very blunt , staged social interactions , and they , and there 's just numbers going back and forth between the people , and they bring enormous sensitivities to it .
we can compute that during the game .
after 10 years of working overseas , i was exhausted .
i 'd seen a lot of death , in particular epidemic death , and epidemic death has a different feel to it .
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over .
and in fact i would visit friends of mine , and i noticed that they had water that came right into their homes .
how many of you have such a situation ?
( laughter ) and some of them , many of them actually , had water that came into more than one room .
and i asked the question , what are you doing about it ?
the problem of violence was stuck , and this has historically been the case in many other issues .
in other words , for t.b . you have to find somebody who has active t.b . who is infecting other people .
and so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers , the first being violence interruptors .
now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67-percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago .
they were using parks they were n't using before .
in fact , there have been three independent evaluations of this now .
[ the interrupters ] however , not so fast , because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it .
what do you mean , hiring people who have backgrounds ?
trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up .
so the theory , in a way , is kind of being validated by the treatment .
so i think this is good news , because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages , which is where i feel this field has been .
it gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks , and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods , and to allow there to be a new strategy , a new set of methods , a new set of workers : science , in a way , replacing morality .
the days and weeks that followed , people fleeing to the hills , being forced to drink contaminated water or face death .
then , a few months later , hurricane katrina slammed into the side of america .
do you know it took five days to get water to the superdome ?
i spent all the time setting this up , so i guess i should .
so — someone 's done that up .
and i 've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit .
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .
that 's not dirty enough . let 's just stir that up a little bit .
now as soon as i pop the teat , sterile drinking water is going to come out .
i 've got to be quick . okay , ready ?
there we go . mind the electrics .
( applause ) cheers . ( applause )
what 's it taste of ?
it 'll last for 6,000 liters .
and when it 's expired , using failsafe technology , the system will shut off , protecting the user .
and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water .
what happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp ?
`` so here is the `` '' thinking different '' '' bit . ''
or we could use one of these .
thank you .
it 's then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue .
and every business i 've been working on over the past five years , i 'm trying to lower each one of these elements .
this bench , although it was uncomfortable for my mom — she did n't like sitting on it , so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale — reusing , a job that was pretty good .
if they 're not working , put a shelf on it , which i did , and that shows all the customers my products .
it actually looks better than a brand new one — so looking good there .
rather than me putting a dish down , they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .
three compost bins — go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week — really good , makes fantastic compost .
a couple of wormeries in there too .
this restaurant looks a little bit like acorn house — same chairs , same tables .
now it 's important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it 's powered by water .
this is basically air-handling .
so basically , the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway .
this is a social enterprise , not-for-profit cooperative supermarket .
in fact , i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world .
and i hope you all take part .
and so that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life .
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
in social groups of animals , the juveniles always look different than the adults .
and then steven spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
and everybody 's happy about that .
and then , then , then , and then ...
( laughter ) ( applause ) and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur , and we chose the dinosaur on the left , a tyrannosaurus rex , which was a very nice specimen .
they found these red circular-looking objects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
but there was something left .
there were flexible , clear blood vessels .
it was extraordinary .
the vessels looked better .
`` we 're just not going to be able to do what they did in `` '' jurassic park . '' '' we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur . ''
so we do n't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .
that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .
and that 's pretty cool .
but there 's another thing .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop , and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail .
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together .
and the same goes for the tails .
birds have basically rudimentary tails .
so what we 're trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chickenosaurus .
( laughter ) it 's a cooler-looking chicken .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
thank you .
in the culture and mythology of democracy , power resides with the people .
it sounds machiavellian inherently .
seamlessly , when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters .
if people do n't learn power , people do n't wake up , and if they do n't wake up , they get left out .
now , part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice , but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding .
this is not some game of thrones empire-level set of questions .
you can not help but reckon with and recognize the command they have of the elemental questions of civic power — what objective , what strategy , what tactics , what is the terrain , who are your enemies , who are your allies ?
we live in a time right now where in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization , all citizenship is ever more resonantly , powerfully local .
the localism of our time is networked powerfully .
and our task now is to accelerate this work .
and what i 'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces , to create something powerfully collective .
i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our facebook page for citizen university .
if we do that , then together we can make civics sexy again .
and the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the enlightenment , in part , because of what people were drinking there .
you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin — particularly around 1650 — and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
i mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
and the question is : how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form ?
and so all you need is the spare parts from your toyota and the ability to fix a headlight , and you can repair this thing .
so when they were sitting in front of the microscope , when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler , and all these things .
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab , we have this image — you know , they 're pouring over the microscope , and they see something in the tissue sample .
`` so they want to tell the story of the `` '' eureka ! '' '' moment . ''
he 's in his study , it 's october of 1838 , and he 's reading malthus , actually , on population .
`` and all of a sudden , the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says , `` '' ah , at last , i had a theory with which to work . '' '' that 's in his autobiography . ''
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's office , and they start kind of noodling around — hacking , as we might call it now .
and after a couple of hours , they actually start picking up the signal , because the soviets made sputnik very easy to track .
they get permission to use the new , you know , univac computer that takes up an entire room that they 'd just gotten at the apl .
`` a couple weeks later their boss , frank mcclure , pulls them into the room and says , `` '' hey , you guys , i have to ask you something about that project you were working on . ''
could you go the other way ?
and it 's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow , if you do n't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean .
so , you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown , you have the non-obvious , you have the non-seen , for the people who do n't dare to go through the ice .
we want to go in a direction , but the winds push us in another direction , like in life .
we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas .
life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension . no .
this can be in environment , in finance , in education of children .
well , these basically are things i believed in such a long time .
but sometimes it 's very paradoxical .
this is why you need people with long-term vision .
when we were flying over the sahara and india it was nice holidays .
that 's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
if you tell to people , we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world , people will laugh at you , except here , where crazy people are invited to speak .
which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .
and with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane , we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs .
it 's not designed by an artist , but it could be .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
a real airplane that we could finally present .
a little bit like on this picture here .
`` it 's a pipe , and it 's written , `` '' this is not a pipe . '' '' this is not an airplane . ''
this is acceptable .
so , you see , this is what we 're doing on our side .
we 've got the words . we have the vocabulary .
i work in the field of electoral assistance , so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections .
afghanistan .
the reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult , it seemed to be more efficient to do that .
people had no idea about what a box looked like .
it was an enormous , enormous historical moment .
and it 's gone a long way . we published 10,000 copies .
so that 's very good to know .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
what are they aspiring to ?
the silent majority is silent because they do n't have the words .
the silent majority does not need to be silent .
man , her office was packed .
it just takes a little bit more .
but i really needed a support network , a group of people who were going to help me make sure that i was n't going to be a victim of my own circumstance , that they were going to push me beyond what i even thought i could do .
and eventually , i ended up at a school where there was a mixture .
well , we 're making school worth coming to every day .
these were played in the local trolley system .
( applause )
you go into these booths , you interview your grandmother or relative , you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress .
jake barton : so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
`` visitors are transient . we want people who live here , people who have ownership . '' '' and so what we 're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you 're interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it 's from , or manipulate the work itself . ''
this is rodin 's bust . you get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity .
and it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story .
so it 's estimated that a third of the world watched 9/11 live , and a third of the world heard about it within 24 hours , making it really by nature of when it happened , this unprecedented moment of global awareness .
and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world , through video , through photos , through written history , and so people 's experiences on that day , which was , in fact , this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform .
( multiple voices ) voice 7 : it was probably about 11 o'clock at night .
voice 10 : trying to frantically get to a radio .
`` `` and how did the world change after 9/11 ? '' ''
and suddenly the institution , once again , turns into a listening experience .
so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices , but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event .
and so when you go to the memorial , you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves .
`` you and your mom should be put in jail . ' '' '' i 've never been afraid to tell aboody anything . ''
you see , i 'm a saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars .
just for giving me his car keys , my own brother was detained twice , and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist , leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son .
but my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine .
he broke the good/bad news in my face .
it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women .
i was released after nine days .
so for me , it was n't only about these attacks i had to face .
one of them is when i was in jail .
`` it was more like this : `` '' manal al-sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive . '' '' i know . ''
the way they called it : a betrayal to the saudi country and the saudi people , and they even started a hashtag called # oslotraitor on twitter .
thank you .
so for me , it 's not about only these small steps .
i hope you find clues to answer that from my speech .
every publication has a house style .
if we do our job well , we 're invisible , but as soon as we make a mistake , we copy editors become glaringly visible .
ouch .
there 's no excuse for this mistake .
the editor never sells out the writer , never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long .
`` i told sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said , `` only three ? '' ''
`` [ everyone in the vicinity held their breath ] `` '' their '' '' is plural and `` '' everyone , '' '' its antecedent , is singular . ''
( laughter ) it is my job when i see it in print to do my best to eliminate it .
nope .
two out of three is n't bad .
something big is going on in war today , and maybe even the history of humanity itself . the u.s. military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air .
we now have 5,300 .
one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three-star general , and he said basically , where we 're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts , and these numbers matter , because we 're not just talking about tens of thousands of today 's robots , but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow 's robots , because of course , one of the things that 's operating in technology is moore 's law , that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots , and so flash forward around 25 years , if moore 's law holds true , those robots will be close to a billion times
now , i need to be clear here .
the germans figured out how to use it right , and so what we have to think about for the u.s. is that we are ahead right now , but you have 43 other countries out there working on military robotics , and they include all the interesting countries like russia , china , pakistan , iran .
how do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools ?
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in china and software is written in india ?
`` people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless . '' '' robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic , and maybe take them to their logical ending point . ''
the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site . missile hits , bodies burst into the air with the explosion .
`` it was set to the pop song `` '' i just want to fly '' '' by sugar ray . ''
it 's like the difference between watching an nba game , a professional basketball game on tv , where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen , and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like .
these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game . they lose the context .
they lose the humanity . war just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs .
so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we 're fighting against radical groups .
so , when we train , we 're always trying to take into account the dog 's point of view .
`` and you go , `` '' oh , there 's a good boy . '' '' you bend down , you pat him — you reward him for jumping up . ''
so , we get in dog training this notion of dominances , or of the alpha dog . i 'm sure that you 've heard this .
and because he 's performing a behavior you 've trained him to do ?
and that 's how we use the food lure in the hand , and we use food because we 're dealing with owners .
`` you know , `` '' sit , sit . '' '' no , we go , `` '' puppy , sit '' '' — boom , it 's got it in six to 10 trials . ''
the dog lives with you , the dog can get you any time .
this is a life-or-death thing .
they think a punishment is something nasty .
there 's several definitions of what a punishment is , but one definition , the most popular , is : a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior , such that it 's less likely to occur in the future .
and i would say , if it does n't have to be , then maybe it should n't be .
and this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital , plus the brother-in-law , plus the child .
a lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen , so while i was there — this was on the fourth visit — we did a four and a half hour down-stay , with the dog on his mat .
she never raised her voice .
`` instead , the dog says , `` '' i know that tone . i know that tone . ''
kick , kick , kick .
`` and ugly face is this — when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child , you say , `` '' what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! '' '' and i went , `` '' oh my god , do i do something ? '' '' that child has lost everything — that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet . ''
`` and i thought , `` '' do i tell this jerk to quit it ? '' '' i thought , `` '' ian , stay out of it , stay out of it , you know , walk on . '' '' i walked to the back of the plane , i sat down , and a thought came to me . ''
this is how we go into a relationship , and it 's hunky-dory for a year .
you see it especially in the workplace , especially from boss to employee .
when i was a kid , i was a calculus whiz .
`` all you 've got to do is to watch them , to time-sample the behavior , and say , every five minutes , you ask the question , `` '' is it good , or is it bad ? '' '' if it 's good , say , `` '' that was really neat , thank you . '' '' that is such a powerful training technique . ''
now this is the real . it 's a cauliflower .
well , it 's very interesting .
now , it did n't take me any time .
what good is that , to know these things ?
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it 's nothing .
and the others say , no , five basketball [ courts ] .
the bronchi branch , branch , branch and they stop branching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical considerations : the mucus , which is in the lung .
well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .
this cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
the seer of clouds had to take account of it .
well , a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke , and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness .
`` when i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said , `` '' do n't be silly . it 's just something [ silly ] . '' '' well actually , i was not silly . ''
but painting for a long time had a fractal side .
`` then i was telling my assistant , `` i do n't see anything . can you paint it ? '' ''
and you have the little nonsense which is left .
in other words , it is not acts of god that we should put aside .
so i looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
i mean this comes out .
and then this one .
so where did this come from ?
`` ( laughter ) well , so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that `` '' discovery '' '' and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying , `` but that 's simply a mandelbrot set very big . '' ''
( applause )
hi . i 'm here to talk about congestion , namely road congestion .
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
it 's moving by itself , okay .
so , we followed up . what happened ?
okay . so why can that be ? why is that ?
i mean , the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared , surely they must be discontent in a way .
and why is that ? it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think .
and the other question , who changed their mind ?
so we did another interview survey , tried to figure out why people changed their mind , and what type of group changed their minds ?
they 're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along .
and i would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in yemen .
this picture shows a revolution started by women , and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
is it going to be another somalia ?
so let 's talk about the personal story for a moment .
na : well , let me first warn you that i 'm not the traditional yemeni girl .
i wish i could show you my yemen .
i wish you could see yemen through my eyes .
`` `` '' what 's this young girl coming in and showing off because it 's her family business , '' '' or something . ''
but with all due respect to all the men , and the older men especially , they did not want me around .
( applause ) and in the first year , i had to fire half of the men .
`` and it 's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , `` '' i am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . '' '' and the more empowered the women become , the more they are able to remove the veil , for example , or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel . ''
and i have done this throughout my work .
and i just wanted to share with you : there 's one reporter that came .
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen .
yementimes.com .
you can just hold up fingers .
has ever caused you any anxiety .
( laughter ) any anxiety at all .
but eventually this sense of boredom , this feeling of , like , yeah , i got this , this is n't challenging anymore — it would get to be too much .
the first was that i was n't sure how i was going to turn any of this into a career .
it 's this idea of destiny or the one true calling , the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth , and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it .
what if there are a lot of different subjects that you 're curious about , and many different things you want to do ?
it 's a mouthful to say .
here are three multipotentialite super powers .
sha and rachel came up with this unique idea not despite , but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences .
that 's where the new ideas come from .
we observe everything we can get our hands on .
( laughter ) before becoming a writer , nora was a financial planner .
( laughter ) in fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together .
and sadly , multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers .
( applause )
( laughter ) after seeing a few of these buildings — there are many in the city — we realized that they have three very big points .
in a city where this should n't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction .
it has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians .
it 's a huge challenge to understand .
in time , from milliseconds to millennia , again around 14 orders of magnitude .
what does that mean ?
we 're interested in the climate .
the stuff that we ca n't resolve , the sub-scale processes , we need to approximate in some way .
we have 14 to go , and we 're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade .
we can code each of those very small pieces as well .
when something changes , what happens to those properties ?
so we can go to look at what model skill is .
we know what happened over the 20th century .
but there 's one key reason why we look at models , and that 's because of this phrase here .
we can do some work to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
we can do more work to really bring it down so that by the end of the century , it 's not much more than there is now .
we might see something entirely different , because perception is subjective .
how could it be that when i look at a person , an object , or an event , i see something very different than somebody else does ?
across the world , people are struggling to manage their weight , and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off .
importantly , though , this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise .
it did .
we all see the world through our mind 's eye , but we can teach ourselves to see it differently .
and on days like these , when everybody looks upset and angry to me , i try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them .
we can teach ourselves to see it differently , and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier , it might actually become so .
he 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . ( laughter ) it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it was n't what you see on tv .
in fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate .
now , 95 percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about were n't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first-time user , focus-grouping new product launches , territorial expansion .
and it 's hard for a couple of reasons .
you pay everything in stamps . those are the currency .
you charge another inmate to clean his cell .
and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
thank you . ( applause )
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
so i am harvesting the wheat , in order to make the dough .
back in the mid-'80s when we were designing biosphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
i mean , what is a biosphere ?
will it work ? or will something happen that we ca n't understand and we ca n't fix , thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres ?
this is the agriculture .
at that moment i became part of that biosphere .
when i breathed out , my co2 fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it was n't that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
pretty straightforward really .
and we proved the concept , more or less .
and everybody ran up to me .
now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean , but nothing with perfume .
i had been growing all my own food .
i had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
and i 'm also proud to announce that you 're getting a sneak preview — on friday we 're going to announce that we 're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people .
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
we 're in the process of transforming from this , to what i would call a biophilic society , one where we learn to nurture society .
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and i want to throttle them .
we 're very uncomfortable with untidiness .
and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake .
the small stuff counts .
the yogis had it right .
breath does , in fact , connect us all in a very literal way .
there perhaps is the co2 from the person sitting next-door to you .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
the question today is not : why did we invade afghanistan ?
how has this happened ?
in the third act , we went into bosnia and kosovo and we seemed to succeed .
why are we still stuck in afghanistan ?
so , as the president now reassures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
all of this is wrong .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i 'm wrong , it 's extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million afghans had mobile telephones .
and the same is true for the troops .
commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj was a great host .
but he was also considerably more conservative , considerably more anti-foreign , considerably more islamist than we 'd like to acknowledge .
today , he could never do that .
i ran a center at harvard from 2008 to 2010 , and there were people like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently , who 've traveled to almost every district in the country .
well the answer , of course , is , if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country , you co-opt almost everybody .
it 's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest .
the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ; italian soldiers , on tours of four months ; the american military , on tours of 12 months .
borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .
one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan is that we 've got our priorities out of sync .
this does n't mean that afghanistan does n't matter , but that it 's one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage .
when you 're doing mountain rescue , you do n't take a doctorate in mountain rescue , you look for somebody who knows the terrain .
thank you very much .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
as the trevor project says , it gets better .
i was asked by wilsonart international , a plastic laminate company , which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world — they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york , in 2000 .
in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .
we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states , that would collect records and go on tours .
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
`` and do you think kids , you know , skateboarders , surfers , rock climbers , would use these things ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , not in that interior . '' '' ( laughter ) anyway , i went out to airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it 's called the bambi prototype . ''
so the problem became — and they set this dilemma to me — that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there 's no money for tooling or molding .
( applause )
when we think of nepal , we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains of the himalayas , the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes , or the huge expanse of its grasslands .
not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape , but it also allows you to capture detailed , high-resolution images of objects on the ground .
so what is a drone ?
it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission , to tell the drone where to go .
all you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly .
so what can we do with a conservation drone ?
but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently .
now , conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology .
we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes .
( applause )
( laughter ) the individually productive chickens had only achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of the rest .
and thirdly , the more successful groups had more women in them .
when alex pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other , profits went up 15 million dollars , and employee satisfaction went up 10 percent .
so i went and i sat in on the auditions at the royal academy of dramatic art in london .
( laughter ) ( applause ) once you appreciate truly how social work is , a lot of things have to change .
there was a lot at stake then , and there 's a lot at stake now , and we wo n't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen .
now we need everybody , because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure .
my dream was coming true .
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
let me tell you why it was so wrong .
and if you change it in a third way , you get cauliflower .
and we kind of take it for granted how we 've changed sex .
what 's happened with sex over time is — normally , sex equals baby , eventually .
but in today 's world , sex plus pill equals no baby .
and it 's not the case for animals .
what it is does is it gives us control , so sex becomes separate from conception .
assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization .
so you 've separated the baby from the body from the act .
why ?
that makes people nervous .
when we put vaccines into people , we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk .
because we 've built unnatural plants , unnatural animals , we can feed about seven billion people .
and as you create new life-forms , again , that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome , until you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table .
it 's the same with a wheat field , it 's the same with a rice field .
it 's the same with a city , it 's the same with a suburb .
how about this random mutation stuff ?
so as you 're thinking of lifecode , let 's think of five principles as to how we start guiding , and i 'd love you to give me more .
the reason we have to take responsibility is because we 're in charge .
but we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet .
and it 's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution .
( applause ) last thing i 'll say .
it would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you 're scared of it , because you 're hiding from it .
you can participate in the ethics . you can participate in the politics .
you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being — nitrous oxide , methane , deforestation , overfishing land degredation , loss of species — they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years .
you see , for the first time , an imprint on the global level .
the arctic — a beautiful system — a regulating biome at the planetary level , taking the knock after knock on climate change , appearing to be in a good state .
and the drama is , of course , that when the system does this , the logic may change .
you know , you do n't want to stand there .
in fact , you 're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing , at the foaming , slippery waters at the threshold .
but it shows that we are interconnected , among many systems on the planet , with the three big systems , climate change , stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems , where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet .
and then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify — air pollution , including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates , but also chemical pollution .
together , these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the anthropocene , understanding that the planet is a complex self-regulating system .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
this is a new paradigm .
do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
we know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time .
( laughter ) now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented , but it does happen all the time .
in the case of gooseberry natural resources , this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself , and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release , and it turns out that is press release — as in p.r .
wrong .
now perhaps it 's because no such screenshots actually existed , but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle .
with no employees .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
it turns out , because they 're paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse .
now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system .
the hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers .
but what if there was something to it ?
i will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future .
one big problem we have — to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level — is that we ca n't study the brains in detail , in living people .
so if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age , can we learn something about the brain ?
so our body lives in a very different environment as we get older , when it comes to these factors .
but more importantly : is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life — will live to 100 or more ?
instead , we 've reasoned , then , that it must be the soluble factors , so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma , and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice , and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects , but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice .
it can be rejuvenated .
young blood factors can reverse aging , and what i did n't show you — in this model , the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old .
thank you very much .
it was a historical day .
instead , so far , the measurements coming from the lhc show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena .
but the reason why i am interested in the transition of the higgs field is because i want to address the question , why is the higgs boson mass so special ?
more than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
and indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new universes , literally .
in the majority of bubble universes , the higgs mass could be around the critical value , near to a cosmic collapse of the higgs field , because of two competing effects , just as in the case of sand .
my story does not have an end , because we still do n't know the end of the story .
( applause )
what we mean when we say those things is : i see you there .
i 'm obsessed with talking to strangers .
these were really profound experiences .
but i did what he said . i stepped back onto the sidewalk .
she has no bonds , no connections .
her survival strategy is this : get one stranger to see you as a real , individual person .
the second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy .
this gets reported in the media with great lament .
`` and you 're thinking , `` i gave you the look . '' ''
the rules are very different depending on what country you 're in , what culture you 're in .
or , if you ask someone for directions , they 're very likely to invite you home for coffee .
we see these unwritten rules most clearly when they 're broken , or when you 're in a new place and you 're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is .
if you 're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here , smile .
i 'm a big fan of noticing people 's shoes .
what would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves ?
thank you .
let me read you the entry .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
`` and , one day , he came in to my session — exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions — and he said to me , `` '' wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you 're going to break one of those bands . ''
adversity is n't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
it 's part of our life .
we can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
`` sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i scream , `` 4chan ! '' ''
now , six and a half years later , over seven million people are using it , contributing over 700,000 posts per day .
rickroll was this bait and switch , really simple , classic bait and switch .
( laughter ) there are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
( laughter ) so they broke that poll .
( laughter ) so we 've got this activist group that 's this grassroots group that 's come out of the site .
they matched , they found his myspace .
we 're moving towards persistent identity .
but anonymity basically allows people to say anything , all the rules gone .
( laughter ) 99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out .
it went up to about 16,000 posts , and now it has been taken off .
what 's the commercial picture here ?
cp : at first , very kind of pained , awkward conversations .
we all go to doctors .
and we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they 're prescribing are based upon evidence — evidence that 's designed to help us .
ok , there 's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes , but no matter who walks through the door to the er , we order the same tests , we prescribe the same medication , without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients .
not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process .
so it was decided : medical research was performed on men , and the results were later applied to women .
and we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults .
heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women , but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men .
and for some reason we call this atypical , even though , as i mentioned , women do make up half the population .
the institute of medicine has said every cell has a sex .
right now .
but i must warn you : this is not easy .
this is about personalized , individualized health care for everyone .
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
they had bad grades . some of them dropped out .
i had a question in my mind : would hispanic kids react the same way as the american kids ?
this little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
but she ate it .
you know what ? this is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
thank you so much .
similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
the difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge .
but i think it 's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection , and they 're overly cautious .
instead of showing the progress that she made , she 'd rather show nothing at all .
my friend lev brie , who is a professor at the university of columbia and teaches intro to java tells me about his office hours with computer science students .
take , for instance , two of our high school students who built a game called tampon run — yes , tampon run — to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming .
or the syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help americans get to the polls .
or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy 's life because he has cancer .
this year we 'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states .
ca : and you 're working with some of the companies in this room even , who are welcoming graduates from your program ?
rs : yeah , we have about 80 partners , from twitter to facebook to adobe to ibm to microsoft to pixar to disney , i mean , every single company out there .
i mean , i think that it 's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women .
and i think when companies have diverse teams , and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams , they build awesome things , and we see it every day .
this whole community is cheering you on . more power to you . thank you .
rs : thank you .
each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .
and this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
and if they really were intelligent , why would they crack open nuts with a rock ?
i mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago .
our species can make stuff , therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has .
and most importantly for this , it 'll tell us why we have language .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation — for reaching agreements , for striking deals and for coordinating our activities .
okay , now replay this scene now , and you 're approaching the one who has language .
now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to , with social learning and language , we could transform the environment to suit our needs .
currently , there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on earth .
there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles .
and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures , we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups .
they slow the flow of technologies .
and they even slow the flow of genes .
but that does n't tell us they necessarily had language .
( applause )
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
it 's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and it 's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
play is not frivolous .
( applause )
but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is .
and i just want you to think a little bit about , remember for yourself , it 's annoying when you hit this thing .
`` and you 're like , `` '' oh , i did n't want to see that . '' '' that 's the 404 feeling . ''
( video ) guy : joey !
this is one that blames you .
this is an error page , but what if this error page was also an opportunity ?
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
thank you .
we never spoke to each other for three decades , and then a couple of years ago , i decided to turn the spotlight on him .
and what he meant was , you as a child of a jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn , to see whether you conform to the host nation 's stereotype of you , of being feckless , work-shy , destined for a life of crime .
`` and that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life and understanding , as they say , the native americans say , `` '' do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins . '' '' but in conjuring his life , it was okay and very straightforward to portray a caribbean life in england in the 1970s with bowls of plastic fruit , polystyrene ceiling tiles , settees permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in . ''
they leave their homes . my father and my mother left jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles , and yet they were infantilized by travel .
even in his absence , that old mantra remained : you are being watched .
this will close the generation gap , perhaps .
i lost my hatred of my father .
in the original photograph , i 'm being held up by my father , bageye , but when my parents separated , my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives .
but there 's another way of looking at this photograph .
imagine , for example , an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision on top of the physical world .
well , these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago , but things have changed .
so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you .
every time her ex-boyfriend would show up , at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations , he was carrying an open laptop , and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car , so she was calling me for help to disable it .
`` `` '' i already have , '' '' she replied . ''
well , because it 's not a bubble at all .
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
even so , up until very recently , nobody worried about gps spoofers .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
there is , though , one redeeming feature of the gps spoofer .
so i 'm fascinated by this conflict , a looming conflict , between privacy on the one hand and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other .
we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .
there is so much information ; what do you do ?
what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at ?
and we have a small team who is working on this .
take the crowd and apply them to the information .
so that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
seriously — doomed , doomed !
i think it 's odious .
and i also think it 's dangerous , and i do n't want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
why not think about it this way ?
( laughter ) so when i heard that i was like — that 's uncanny , that 's exactly what my creative process is like . ( laughter )
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
i 'd like to show them around so we can just , you know — ( laughter ) actually , i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures — even better .
it 's actually a simple one , but it 's a good one to start with .
it 's a picture by paul klee .
yeah , that 's great .
i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced .
but to go on , here is a very good example to see .
and yeah , we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background .
and yeah , it 's the sort of thing you produce when you 're doodling on the phone .
now , i 'll count to three , and on the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you . ok ?
or here , for example , we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve .
( laughter ) one can obviously also make combinations .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
there is no textbooks , i mean , not yet , anyway .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
thank you very much .
and she 's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do , a kind of teetering , my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way .
and one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror .
when is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ?
this is faye . faye is 13 and she lives in denver .
it 's sunday night .
thousands of people are posting videos like this , mostly teenage girls , reaching out in this way .
but what 's leading them to do this ?
there 's simply no privacy .
what 's a highlight in someone 's life versus what 's normal in the context of everyday .
and trends like # thinspiration , # thighgap , # bikinibridge and # proana .
for those who do n't know , # proana means pro-anorexia .
but how do we do that ?
well , talking , on its own , only gets you so far .
the bad news is that most of them do n't work .
challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles .
you know , cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
as you can see , i use my finger to interact with my digital body .
then it 's going to show inside .
right there .
so our doctors said these are eye candies .
this little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at eth-zurich .
it 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot .
in this mode , he 's trying to maintain his position .
in the next mode , we can get rezero to follow a person .
we call this the orbiting mode .
and since it 's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float , the farther down i go , the more pressure there is on my lungs , the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall .
and it 's a symbolic number for us , because in the 1970s , doctors and physiologists did their math , and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters .
today , we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving .
so i carry on with my dive .
and now , i 'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place .
that 's not what i think when i 'm down there .
maybe it 's because i 've completely released all tensions and let myself go .
looking at this picture , i feel very humble — just like when i 'm all the way down at the bottom — because i 'm nothing , i 'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space .
and it still is absolutely fascinating .
i belong up there , on the surface .
you ca n't control them , and you should n't try to — you have to let it happen .
and with everything else that 's going on , you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic .
`` when that happens , you think , `` '' where 's the surface ? ''
you have to stay in the present .
five meters below the surface , i start to breathe out , so that as soon as i get to the surface all i do is breathe in .
it feels good .
let me show you some images to finish my story .
and i guarantee it 's absolute magic .
it was the eve of the gulf war and i organized a global campaign to flood the hotel , the intercontinental in geneva , where james baker and tariq aziz were meeting on the eve of the war , and i thought if i could flood them with faxes , we 'll stop the war .
i 'd argue that in the last 20 years , something more fundamental has changed than just new tech .
and we see new power all around us .
but what 's striking is the commonalities , the structural features of these new models and how they differ from old power .
so we 've talked a little bit about what new power is .
people thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements .
new power folks would never have invented the u.n. today , for better or worse .
so this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy .
but when he got into office , he governed like more or less all the other presidents did .
and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else .
they , that one , is hairy and walking on four legs .
the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation .
`` we 've got to go back to square one and start again . '' '' it made him very unpopular . they did n't want to go back to square one . ''
i mean , it 's a terrible thing to happen .
well , we know the answer because thomas s. kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962 .
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened .
`` you must never do that again . '' '' and at that time , it became set in stone : the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis , as part of the lunatic fringe of science . ''
`` i suggested it and people said , `` '' no no no . ''
the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros .
well they do know , that if you look at other aquatic mammals , the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall , around the kidneys and the intestines and so on , has started to migrate to the outside , and spread out in a layer inside the skin .
it was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak .
trying to imagine a diver diving into water — hardly makes a splash .
there was professor tobias . he 's come over .
sir david attenborough , he 's come over .
i do n't think there is a third option .
the syllabus does n't mention even the fact that we 're naked , let alone look for a reason to it .
`` somebody up there is issuing the commandment , `` '' thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory . ''
move on ... in fact ... concern ...
you may not know this , but you are celebrating an anniversary with me .
physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition , and usually after two to five years , you die .
thankfully , i met reda girgis , who is dry as toast , but he and his team at johns hopkins did n't just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaningful life .
i come from colorado .
and i gave up salt , i went vegan , and i started taking huge doses of sildenafil , also known as viagra .
i could barely stand up without feeling like i was going to faint .
if you go through a metal detector , you 'll probably die .
then in february of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
i had to say goodbye in some way , shape or form .
`` my fingers started turning blue , and i was like , `` '' what is going on here ? '' '' i heard my heart 's valves snapping open and closed . ''
i was dying , and if i did n't mix that stuff up fast , i would never leave that apartment alive .
and they had lungs .
so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice .
whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs , death happens .
and some of us might even sing .
( applause ) [ singing : french ] thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and the information is there twice — one on each strand — which is important , because when new cells are formed , these strands come apart , new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .
so we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
and we will find that the two genomes in me , or one genome of mine we want to use , will have about three million differences in the order of that .
this is surprising , of course , because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa .
so a model to explain this is that a part of the african variation , but not all of it , [ has ] gone out and colonized the rest of the world .
so what i often like to say is that , from a genomic perspective , we are all africans .
but does this then mean , as many people tend to think , that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people — on different continents , for example ?
and with absolute difference — and i mean a difference where people inside africa at a certain position , where all individuals — 100 percent — have one letter , and everybody outside africa has another letter .
and one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ?
if they then mixed with each other there , then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world .
we mixed with these earlier forms of humans , wherever we met them , and we mixed with each other ever since .
since , our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves — any street in california .
( laughter ) sometimes our cars get so crazy , they even do little stunts .
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
i came back in '86 .
`` you know , the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor , and , therefore i think it 's okay . '' '' but it appeared to me that all these years that i 'd been working on exploitation — exploitation by landlords , by moneylenders , by traders — gave me an insight that probably i was also an exploiter , because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people — those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me — and nothing ever went back to them . ''
( murmuring ) pardon ?
and every year , 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually .
no machines have been developed .
so the silence of scientists , of technologists , of public policy makers , of the change agent , drew our attention that this is not on , this is not on ; this is not the way society will work .
it all begins with curiosity .
somebody was talking yesterday about maslowian hierarchy .
now , this lady , on the wall of the dung cake heap , has made a painting .
( applause ) look at what sheikh jahangir has done .
they have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy , in terms of cost , in terms of quality .
and that is what sheikh jahangir did .
it 's a hot plate made of clay .
this lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation .
in the scaling up , there 's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you 're making .
look at what he is doing .
what has appachan done ? appachan , unfortunately , is no more , but he has left behind a message .
( applause ) ag : many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally — what i call a g2g model , grassroots to global .
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that 's a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .
and in south africa , we had taken our innovators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have .
and this is a donkey cart which they modified .
this is in china . this girl needed a breathing apparatus .
products have gone to the market , a few .
thank you .
so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound .
and i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
it 's just a lesion formed inside .
we can do it without harming any tissue .
so he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .
it is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .
and this is his handwriting .
and the physician will then take a regular mr scan .
this is an immediate relief .
and john today is fully independent .
he suffers from no neurodeficit .
he 's back to his normal life .
and i would like to tell you about pj .
he had to forgo all the farm activities .
so again , this is an immediate relief .
she was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
and the other thing i would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [ who ] is awake and can even monitor the treatment .
thanks to modern technology , the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors .
mike has n't done anything wrong .
thank you .
it 's during our lifetime that we 're going to take the earth , take the people of earth and transition off , permanently . and that 's exciting .
we americans bought alaska in the 1850s . it 's called seward 's folly .
but i put forward here , the government is not going to get us there .
arguably , it 's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle .
one of the companies i started , space adventures , will sell you a ticket .
we 've done two so far . we 'll be announcing two more on the soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars .
how much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit ?
( laughter ) but guys , if history has taught us anything , it 's that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
i have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
today , the boeings and the lockheeds do n't spend a dollar of their own money in r & d .
peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
`` well , people are going to die , how can you possibly going to put this forward ? '' '' i found a visionary family , the ansari family , and champ car , and raised part of the money , but not the full 10 million . ''
you get publicity increase , and when it 's won , publicity shoots through the roof — if it 's properly managed — and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor .
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome .
then , you 've got to , you know , face potential public ridicule of — that 's a crazy idea , it 'll never work .
we 're going after an orbital prize .
we are looking at a number of energy prizes .
( applause )
he was an economically rational person .
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
what would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
come on . in the western world , we have enough .
`` and he finished his talk with the phrase , that , `` '' the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . '' '' how crazy is that ? that our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ? ''
and really , this is what i 've done with my adult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environmental limits .
and what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens .
it 's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
it 's like quality and quantity of life in nations .
what 's happening in costa rica ?
that 's what we need to do .
that 's one way of looking at it .
and so in strict happy-planet methodology , we 've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .
it 's actually not very long away .
this is not the very distant future .
and if we 're going to engage them , i think that 's what we 've got to do .
did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
and we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being at a government level , they might create national accounts of well-being .
but a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
the third one is take notice .
it 's more curiosity .
keep learning .
and the final one is that most anti-economic of activities , but give .
and so i think it 's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
and then i believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth .
( applause )
in the meantime i 'm also talking to you , so my life is going to be complicated . bear with me .
here we go . i want to see a show of hands .
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultivate an image of a mythical , rural agricultural past .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution .
and it actually drove up our yields .
that is the reality of our modern life .
and that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-called developing countries .
what happened to our bread in the meantime ?
that is , historically , a really unique situation .
never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people .
we added in more sugar .
and today , bread now is associated with obesity , which is very strange .
it is the basic , most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years .
bread has migrated to tropical countries , where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .
`` the counter-movement says , `` '' let 's go back to this . ''
let 's go back to traditional farming .
but this is a fallacy .
we 've moved towards large-scale and very high control .
so we need to think differently about agriculture science .
there is all kinds of things we can do .
you must go back and think about your own food chain .
it 's about sharing . it 's about honesty . it 's about identity .
i want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who 've been making this . and you do n't even know who they are .
thank you very much .
and we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create .
so we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about , except one thing : it would all be about verticality .
so we took this needle and bent it back into itself , into a loop of interconnected activities .
those are tightly intertwined with social clusters : meeting rooms , canteens , chat areas — informal spaces for people to meet and exchange .
so it was a way to script and design the building , but of course , also to communicate its experiences .
the building has become part of everyday life in beijing .
how could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own ?
a little piece of math : if we count all the green that we left on the ground , minus the footprint of the buildings , and we would add back the green of all the terraces , we have 112 percent green space , so more nature than not having built a building .
so institutions could shrink or contract , as , of course , the future of culture is , in a way , the most uncertain of all .
the most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies .
so this right here is the tiny village of elle , close to lista .
but then , after a month , the police in norway got a message from the police in the netherlands .
the police wo n't come search for you because nobody knows you 're gone .
but who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants , because we usually do that in statistics .
we found his name in the records , and he seems to have stayed there alone .
this was after the fall of gaddafi , but before libya turned into full-blown civil war .
and in this last remaining sort of stability in libya , shadi took up scuba diving , and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater .
many may think that the story about shadi and mouaz is a story about death , but i do n't agree .
a better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none , and that 's a strong motivation .
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
first of all , they can give employees and customers more control .
it asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
so , for instance , if you ask , how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis ?
only about 250 .
maybe you 've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way , and the rains come and the lightning flashes , and oh my gosh , there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble , and , uh oh , the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized , and that tugboat , well , it hit the rocks , and maybe if you 're lucky , somebody gets across .
now what you need to do , if you 're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or alzheimer 's disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe .
how do we go faster ?
it 's called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
the normal cell , if you looked at it under the microscope , would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell , which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that .
this has led , in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial , to a test of that very compound .
and instead of telling you more about it , i 'm going to invite one of them , sam berns from boston , who 's here this morning , to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria .
so how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ?
at nih , we have started this new national center for advancing translational sciences .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
and it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound .
we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world .
jonathan haidt : yeah .
so this is why you ca n't win a political argument .
and there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that .
what 's changed that 's deepened this feeling of division ?
i 'll just list a couple of them .
`` the loss of the world war ii generation , `` '' the greatest generation , '' '' is huge . ''
another , in america , is the purification of the two parties .
third is the internet and , as i said , it 's just the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization .
disgust is like indelible ink .
and that 's why i think we 're seeing it , for example , on campus now .
he does n't remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of teletubbies , and lady gaga 's birthday .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary — autistic and extraordinary .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
and so , when you study it , you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .
yours is faith .
`` the gymnosophist said , `` '' why is he conquering the world ? ''
`` what a waste of a life . '' '' to understand this difference in viewpoints , we have to understand the subjective truth of alexander — his myth , and the mythology that constructed it . ''
you should not be sisyphus , who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .
he heard a very different story .
`` and he wanted to hoist his flag to say , `` i was here first . '' ''
you go again and again and again .
you see , the gods have to come back again and again and again as ram , as krishna .
one believes this is the one and only life .
and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .
if you live only once , in one-life cultures around the world , you will see an obsession with binary logic , absolute truth , standardization , absoluteness , linear patterns in design .
you look at art . look at the ballerina , how linear she is in her performance .
( laughter ) and then look at business .
sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land , with the commandments held by the leader .
you see , businesses are not run as institutions , by the idiosyncrasies of individuals .
it is bound to happen .
i love mythology too much .
step a. step b. step c. mostly .
but belief is not measurable .
even if you are indian , it is not very explicit , it is not very obvious .
so , i will not answer the question .
what i will give you is an indian answer , the indian head-shake .
they are cultural creations , not natural phenomena .
you and i , only two .
and you should be really afraid , but not for the reasons why you think you should be .
and this is what this adventure 's really about .
every life form on this planet — every insect , every bacteria , every plant , every animal , every human , every politician — ( laughter ) is coded in that stuff .
and we 're just beginning to understand this stuff .
and this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on .
white europeans were subject to the plague .
we can date it to 700 years ago .
that is one of the reasons why aids is raging across africa as fast as it is , and not as fast across europe .
so , all you guys have heard about dna , all the stuff that dna does , but some of the stuff we 're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet .
this funky little thing : people did n't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and , of course , nothing lived there .
now , the last of these things died in september 1936 .
and if we do that , and insert this into a fertilized wolf 's egg , we may give birth to an animal that has n't walked the earth since 1936 .
because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we 've been for the past billion years , because we 've evolved from that stuff , you can take that tree of life and collapse it back , and in the measure that you learn to reprogram , maybe we 'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze .
this apple is the same thing as this floppy disk .
( laughter ) and when it does that , pushes a .exe , what it does is , it executes the first line of code , which reads just like that , aatcagggaccc , and that means : make a root .
next line of code , tacgggg : make a flower that 's white , that blooms in the spring , that smells like this .
in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it — and , by the way , the first plant was read two years ago ; the first human was read two years ago ; the first insect was read two years ago .
the first thing that we ever read was in 1995 : a little bacteria called haemophilus influenzae .
and in the measure that you can do that , you can go home today , and get on the internet , and access the world 's biggest public library , which is a library of life .
that 's perfectly clear . so , men read that sentence , and they look at that sentence , and they read this .
they look at the same world and they say ...
mice and men are the same . wives know that , but anyway .
that 's why sometimes a person 's genes do n't have to change a lot to get cancer .
do n't have an her-2 receptor ? do n't take receptin .
this is a map which was finished at the harvard business school .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
oh , yeah , and it takes about 5.6 million indians .
well , watch what happens to india .
silicon valley did . and that 's why they say that silicon valley has been powered by ics .
and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have .
now , mathare valley is one of the oldest slums in africa .
`` and she said , `` '' you know , the poverty was n't so bad . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all . '' '' in 2001 , her life changed . ''
and she repurposes them with frills and ribbons , and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter 's sweet 16 or first holy communion — those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum .
and she does really good business . in fact , i watched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
but she still lives in mathare valley .
and so she ca n't move out .
and so with patient capital from acumen and other organizations , loans and investments that will go the long term with them , they built a low-cost housing development , about an hour outside nairobi central .
`` but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . '' '' and in the middle of this economic crisis , where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear , i think we 're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out , recognizing that being poor does n't mean being ordinary . ''
so the machine i 'm going to talk you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was .
it was a machine that was never built , and yet , it will be built .
it was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers .
the first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s , not the 1930s and 1940s .
the reason he never made any of them , he 's a classic nerd .
so as i go through this talk , i want you to imagine this gigantic machine . we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like .
of course , it 's this big .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s , '60s and '70s , which is punch cards . this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the science museum , just not far from here , created by charles babbage , that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built .
you 've got punch cards , a cpu and memory .
you need accessories you 're going to come with .
`` this lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous-to-know lord byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness , thought , `` '' i know the solution : mathematics is the solution . ''
now , some people call her the first programmer .
both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective , but turing told us something very important .
it used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first zx81 .
one of those is a set of plans that we call plan 28 , and that is also the name of a charity that i started with doron swade , who was the curator of computing at the science museum , and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine , and our plan is to build it .
now , i 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the cpu mechanism working .
and increasingly , the price we 're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy .
now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing .
in fact , when i know the data that 's being shared and i 'm asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
but when i do n't know and when i have n't been asked , that 's when the problem arises .
the blue dots are the sites that i 've actually navigated directly to .
the revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today .
this is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate ; this is me being a parent .
going forward , all of our voices need to be heard .
thank you .
`` and little billy says , `` '' my father plays the piano in an opium den . '' '' so the teacher rings up the parents , and says , `` '' very shocking story from little billy today . ''
if you ask about child tax credits , the future of the penguins in the south antarctic , asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture , and we will have an answer for you .
and i 'll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
they control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
one of my favorite facts is that u.s. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year .
that means every one of us , and our children , consumes what would equal a five-pound bag — those bags you have at home . if i had one here and ripped it open , and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply , because of the way we consume produce in america .
that 's what i really try and get people to understand .
( laughter ) and what 's happening is , we 're getting sick .
what goes in is what we are .
and why can they serve that much ?
the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
the usda allows this .
well , tyson did , because there 's no chicken in the chicken .
but this is what most schools serve .
we have no high-fructose corn syrup , no trans fats , no processed foods .
every day and go cook the food for the kids , because this is what we need to do .
so this is a typical menu .
if we 're going to change children 's relationship to food , it 's delicious , nutritious food in the cafeterias , hands-on experience — you 're looking in cooking and gardening classes — and academic curriculum to tie it all together .
`` it 's sort of this `` '' duh '' '' thing . ''
i had 90 employees .
but we really have to educate .
we have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again , because , of course , they do n't — because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long .
if we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative , and we started thinking about food as health , then i think we would n't have corn dogs as lunch .
i love paper , and i love technology , and what i do is i make paper interactive .
and i wanted to go one step further , and i wanted to move one electron on and one electron off .
`` and then i took it back to the printers and showed them what i 've done , and they were like , `` '' of course you can do that . ''
there 's lots of different things we 've created .
it uploads a picture , and the reason why it chose that cake for you , to our facebook page and to twitter .
it 's using bluetooth 4 , so it 's pretty instantaneous .
oh , yes . i just love doing that .
it 's just about , i want to create some great experiences .
so thank you very much .
i 'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination , in terms of technology , in terms of concept .
on the one hand , there 's the wanting processes .
because it 's very powerful . it 's pretty awesome .
because what you can measure in virtuality is everything .
it 's something called the reward schedule .
go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item .
i 've got to keep opening boxes .
i do n't know what 's inside them until i open them .
you find that — you know , between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going .
but we do n't just have pies in the boxes .
in most adventure games , it 's a little bit in-game currency , a little bit experience .
there 's going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item .
but we 're in virtuality . these are n't real boxes .
`` when you get to 13 pies , you 've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now . '' '' keep you engaged . look at what people do — adjust the world to match their expectation . ''
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
this can all seem very sinister .
there are real concerns there .
in reward terms , it 's not money ; it 's not being given cash — that 's nice — it 's doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
and in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them — 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
so they tracked their own private currency , and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted — all organized by the players themselves .
let 's start with business .
and i just look at this , and i think , yes , we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets , by using elements of uncertainty , by using these multiple targets , by using a grand , underlying reward and incentive system , by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups , in terms of streets to collaborate and compete , to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see .
in terms of education , perhaps most obviously of all , we can transform how we engage people .
we can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
`` and these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die . '' '' now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens , but instead odysseus says , `` '' i want to hear that song . ''
and i 'd like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times .
`` i want to hear that song . untie me . '' '' and the first mate wisely resists and does n't untie odysseus . ''
`` he 's like , `` '' is this still the rehearsal , or should i untie him ? '' '' and the first mate thinks , `` well , i guess at some point the rehearsal has to end . '' ''
because there 's two heads inside one person when you think about it .
scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
but then there 's this other self , the future self .
the other reason that it 's difficult to resist temptation is because it 's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self .
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .
so when i was a starving post-doc at columbia university , i was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career .
i mean , you ca n't burn it ; that 's illegal .
but then i thought , oh , i 'm sending myself mixed messages .
`` you 're just telling yourself , `` '' without you , commitment device , i am nothing , i have no self-discipline . '' '' and then when you 're ever in a situation where you do n't have a commitment device in place — like , `` '' oh my god , that person 's offering me a doughnut , and i have no defense mechanism , '' '' — you just eat it . ''
and this is a timely issue .
of course , we know that we 're going to get old .
he 's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate .
he 's going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working .
this use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older .
there is something about what it means to be you which defines you , and it 's kind of permanent and unchanging .
are you this kind of person or that ?
they 're connecting partly , and perhaps even mainly , because they all belong to one body and one brain .
let 's take something like a waterfall .
i 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and i am very confident that i could in no way be as good as them .
and that , i think , is a liberating and exciting prospect .
more people , smaller spaces , less stuff .
climate change : we 're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet .
it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways .
`` and so for me , a mesh company , the `` '' classic '' '' mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other — most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled — allows us to find each other and find things in time and space . ''
and so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them .
how many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing ?
they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching .
and so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car ?
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we 've thrown away , there 's a lot of value in those things .
so people have created this business .
so , really interesting .
so it 's like vacation rentals for cars .
the opposite , as we know , is also true , often more true .
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network , there are all these networks — facebook as well .
and honestly , it 's full of surprises .
now we 're saying that there 's other options as well .
that space is not vital .
subsequent to that , after it 's been going for about a year now , they actually started to lease and create and extend .
so this is an example .
the infrastructure enables that .
now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
and the basic punchline of my talk is , i 'd like to turn that over on its head .
they 're a great model for flies .
so i think , unfortunately , a lot of neuroscientists , we 're all somewhat narcissistic .
but remember that this kind of brain , which is much , much smaller — instead of 100 billion neurons , it has 100,000 neurons — but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for 400 million years .
we 'll calculate the trump number for the fruit fly .
wait for it .
you can tether a fly to a little stick .
as you know , there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet .
but we know how to turn it around , and that 's what i 'm going to talk about today .
this does n't have to be peak fish .
coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about 200 nautical miles , in areas that are called exclusive economic zones , and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas , because the high seas , which are the darker areas on this map , the high seas , it 's a lot harder to control things , because it has to be done internationally .
how many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas ?
well , you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas , so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing , because we can actually get a lot done .
and it 's not just in norway .
we 've seen this happening in countries all around the world , time and time again .
if you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins , obviously , fish is a good business decision .
it also does n't need a lot of land , something that 's in short supply , compared to other protein sources .
and it does n't need a lot of fresh water .
it 's already a big part of our diet , but it can be a bigger part of our diet , which is a good thing , because we know that it 's healthy for us .
but in the oceans , we do n't have that war .
did n't anyone get that ? ( laughter ) illegal fishing .
snappers , nine out of 10 snappers were not snapper .
it 's being done by some in the industry , but not enough , so we 're pushing a law in congress called the safe seafood act , and i 'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef 's petition , where 450 chefs have signed a petition calling on congress to support the safe seafood act .
one billion people .
the medication may take days to arrive , though , because of bad roads .
( applause ) and it 's counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we 're just at the beginning of this .
so we said , okay , how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world ?
and we said , what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers ?
half a billion of us live in megacities .
so we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet , initially for lightweight , urgent stuff , and over time , we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem .
well , we chose to do this one not because it 's easy , but because it can have amazing impact .
imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter .
we do need to engage , though , in social fiction to make it happen .
and to do that , i 'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies .
so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems .
and it 's everywhere .
it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition — a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel .
( laughter ) just a little .
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
see for me , cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet , it 's a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay .
( laughter ) what i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment .
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
the children looked and were amazed .
well , there was a girl in the town , and she did n't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets , or if they were , there ought to be a law to allow the children access .
they want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . it 's this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment .
in our day , we have digitization . that strips all the physical mass out of information , so now it 's almost zero cost to copy and share information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
it 's the system by which we organize and exercise power , and there i 'm talking about politics , because in politics , we 're back to this system , this top-down hierarchy .
so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there 's a few more coming on board .
it was just like that , because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen , these very pompous politicians , they were just like us .
so i 've mentioned wikileaks , because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material ?
is that radical openness ? i say it 's not , because for me , what it means , it does n't mean abdicating power , responsibility , accountability , it 's actually being a partner with power . it 's about sharing responsibility , sharing accountability . also , the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks , i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology , to be honest , as well . ( laughs ) the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive , and you must have two real qualities , i think , when you come to the table , when you 're dealing with power , talking about power , because of its seductive capacity .
but the world is n't a fairy tale , and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge .
for instance , just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft .
( laughter ) ( applause ) since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms , it 's not additional growth that piracy has prevented , but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms — one that did n't exist in the 90 's .
what we 're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .
and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft , have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .
some people think this number 's a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it does n't get compounded for inflation every year .
and when i did , i thought , well , i 'd better look this word up in the dictionary .
if you have appendicitis , they take your appendix out , and you 're cured .
but what it means in the original indo-european is a change in direction , going in a different way .
i ca n't tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago .
and by the human spirit , i do n't mean anything divine , i do n't mean anything supernatural — certainly not coming from this skeptic .
so , the lesson is very clear . the lesson is that our patient — the world , and the disadvantaged of the world — that patient deserves our compassion .
he was about age five .
ca : and about a year after this picture , you married a beautiful woman .
so it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation of the oceans of the sky , and as i developed different types of satellite communication systems , the main thing i did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites , the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller , and after going through direct television broadcasting , i had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite , the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish , a flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile ,
`` bina said , `` '' i love your soul , and whether the outside is martin and martine , it does n't it matter to me , i love your soul . '' '' my son said , `` '' if you become a woman , will you still be my father ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes , i 'll always be your father , '' '' and i 'm still his father today . ''
ca : you yourself do n't always feel 100 percent female .
mr : correct . i would say in some ways i change my gender about as often as i change my hairstyle .
i wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research .
they made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases , and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension .
there are tens of millions of people working on writing code that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness , and you do n't have to be a genius to see that all these threads are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness , and it 's something we 'll value .
i 've designed puzzles for books , printed things .
i 'm the puzzle columnist for discover magazine .
`` i did puzzles for `` '' bejeweled . '' '' ( applause ) i did n't invent `` '' bejeweled . '' '' i ca n't take credit for that . ''
`` one hint : it 's not `` '' l. '' '' ( laughter ) it could be an `` '' l , '' '' of course . ''
oh yeah . so , clever thing .
`` `` '' fun to solve , '' '' as opposed to everyday problems , which , frankly , are not very well-designed puzzles . ''
they 're very ancient . it goes back as long as there is written history .
so , one thing i found early on , when i started doing computer games , is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception .
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .
and so i did this for him . it 's sort of a visual canon .
now , those are fun to look at .
now , if you could pick up the black vase , it would look like the figure on top .
well , you ca n't do that physically , but on a computer you can do it . let 's switch over to the p.c .
but that is also true of any white area .
this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubik 's cube .
so , here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place .
it 's done very well . i love this puzzle .
now i 'm making it available to schools .
`` and i said , `` '' well , how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ? '' '' cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overlaps , and you basically match them at the edges . and i said , `` this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle , except the pieces overlap . '' ''
and depending on which one weighs which amount , they 'll fall different directions .
and the main players are over 35 , and are female .
now , within that there is some interesting things happening .
`` our first game is called `` '' photo grab . '' '' the game takes about a minute and 20 seconds . ''
where is that ?
( applause )
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they did n't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
but remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
`` suddenly big things can be done for love . '' '' watch , this spring , for paul hawken 's new book — author and entrepreneur many of you may know about . ''
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
i 'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
if we do n't develop the stamina to stick with things — whatever it is you pick , stick with it — all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fad .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
and i want you to imagine that it 's 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
announcer two : famine in somalia . announcer three : police pepper spray .
it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
perhaps instead , it 's the distortions brought to us of what 's really going on .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
it 's not about being scarce , it 's about accessibility .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors .
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
what about contributions we ca n't even predict ?
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
thank you .
number two : do n't compete with food crops .
now the problems with closed photobioreactors are : they are quite expensive , they are automated , and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale .
now you take europaea , which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have .
you can see there 's a greenhouse in germany that sells it as a health food product .
i 've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior .
if you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town , people will move there .
indeed , there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the ceos .
she was wholly unconcerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers .
her husband is also a science teacher , and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park .
and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent , which is twice as much as in other countries but , as taxes go , hardly crippling .
people no longer feel free to act on their best judgment .
we need regulation to make sure people do n't pollute and such .
and of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
absolutely vital .
but reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year .
well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law .
it goes on . we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york . the board of ed . had no idea .
it does n't seem to be working very well does it ?
neither in sacramento nor in washington .
`` archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they wo n't know about defensive medicine and stuff , but they 'll see all these labels , `` '' contents are extremely hot . '' '' they 'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac . ''
that 's the only explanation . because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot ?
i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing .
states with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies .
( applause ) we have to rehumanize the law .
this is the hardest hurdle .
it 's not true . authority , in fact , is essential to freedom .
if the judge does n't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims , then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders .
it 's the only way to get our freedom back , and it 's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .
i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address .
now , the good news .
and as you see on this animation , what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star .
there will be the smaller planets , and there will be the big planets , even back to the time of epicurus and then of course copernicus and his followers .
then the copernican revolution brought in telescopes , and of course three more planets were discovered .
so now we have pluto to join the numbers of small planets .
so today , i 'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope , kepler , has been able to tell us in the last few weeks , and , lo and behold , we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus .
in the next few years we will confirm them .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
so , we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own milky way galaxy harbors .
we know and expect that we 'll see that .
why i 'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part .
am i that charming ?
and half the time , what 's happened is it 's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind , to the earth in a bigger space .
this pixel is the earth .
but it 's really tiny .
what if that copernican insignificance was actually all wrong ?
let 's actually try that .
`` when i look back now , i think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called `` '' your fatwa does not apply here : untold stories from the fight against muslim fundamentalism . '' '' the title comes from a pakistani play . ''
according to a 2009 survey of arabic language media resources , between 2004 and 2008 , no more than 15 percent of al qaeda 's victims were westerners .
the first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most muslims are fundamentalist or something about islam is inherently fundamentalist , and this is just offensive and wrong , but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of muslim fundamentalism at all or , even worse , apologizes for it , and this is unacceptable as well .
faizan peerzada and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan .
`` so i had the privilege of watching `` '' naang wal , '' '' which was a musical in the punjabi language , and the girls of lahore grammar school played all the parts . ''
and when we did , the whole audience collectively exhaled , and a few people actually wept , and then they filled the auditorium with the peaceful boom of their applause .
maria bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in afghanistan .
a few weeks after i leave afghanistan , i see a headline on the internet .
an afghan prosecutor has been assassinated .
since that time , mr. bihi , who directs the no-budget somali education and advocacy center , has been vocally denouncing the recruitment and the failures of government and somali-american institutions like the abubakar as-saddique islamic center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program .
to counter the efforts of al shabaab to sway more disaffected youth , in the wake of the group 's 2010 attack on world cup viewers in uganda , he organized a ramadan basketball tournament in minneapolis in response .
`` the men who cut her throat then told everyone else , `` '' if you go to university , the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this . '' '' amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m. , which we know because when she fell in the street , her watch broke . ''
and the second place i found amel 's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis .
we must support all of those in honor of amel who continue this human rights struggle today , like the network of women living under muslim laws .
look again at amel zenoune 's watch , forever frozen , and now please look at your own watch and decide this is the moment that you commit to supporting people like amel .
( applause )
i am multidisciplinary .
we did all kinds of research .
i have no doubt about it .
it might take 50 years or it might take 500 years , but it 's going to happen nevertheless .
so they took away the architecture , they kept the base of the artwork , and they built an entirely new , much more biomorphic architecture on top of that .
now , a very typical thing for this project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects .
there 's a 10 percent differential between getting ba 's and all graduate programs , with guys falling behind girls .
and as you all know , boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder — and therefore we drug them with ritalin .
and we 're seeing a steady increase among males .
they do n't know the language of face contact , the non-verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else , listen to somebody else .
so you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained .
as you remember , cindy gallop said men do n't know the difference between making love and doing porn .
it 's a whole lot more like a sponge .
i can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth 's sponge , but where i ca n't , other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me .
this technology enables us to go deeper than we could 've imagined even 10 years ago .
in places like mexico , in the bahamas , and even in cuba , we 're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves , and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions .
( applause )
it 's held every two years in burma .
if you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices .
`` the question was given to a bunch of engineers , about 15 years ago , `` '' how do we make the journey to paris better ? '' '' and they came up with a very good engineering solution , which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast , and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time . ''
the point is that education does n't actually work by teaching you things .
the only problem is : potatoes , if you think about it , look pretty disgusting .
he tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable , and none but the royal family could consume it .
which is that , actually , first one , all value is actually relative .
`` for those of you who do n't speak spanish , jugo de naranja — it 's actually the spanish for `` '' orange juice . '' '' because actually it 's not the dollar . it 's actually the peso in buenos aires . very clever buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists . ''
you start with 12 and they take them away .
another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value , which remember , is what , after all , the environmental movement needs to be about : this again is from prussia , from , i think , about 1812 , 1813 .
you had a monopoly supplier . on the left , you have rupert murdoch , or the bbc .
`` this is actually what 's called , in the digital world , `` '' user-generated content . '' '' although it 's called agriculture in the world of food . ''
we 're not very good at food in general . italians do great food , but it 's not very portable , generally .
now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and thaler and sunstein have , of how we can use these more intelligently .
i 'll give you one example .
yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
obviously , i do n't want people to do this , because as an advertising man i tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed .
( laughter ) in working out how you could re-launch shreddies , he came up with this .
( laughter ) woman : have any of these diamond shapes gone out ? ( laughter )
man : so , shreddies is actually producing a new product , which is something very exciting for them .
woman # 2 : i 'm a little bit confused . woman # 3 : they look like the squares to me .
and a final thing : when you place a value on things like health , love , sex and other things , and learn to place a material value on what you 've previously discounted for being merely intangible , a thing not seen , you realize you 're much , much wealthier than you ever imagined .
i built that stone wall with my bare hands .
i built that pier with my bare hands .
that 's not by chance , that 's by design .
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story , it would go something like this : and that 's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .
he insisted , no embalming , no open coffin , no funeral .
and that 's what all good stories should do at the beginning , is they should give you a promise .
it 's the most inclusive approach you can take .
it 's this well-organized absence of information that draws us in .
make the audience put things together .
editors and screenwriters have known this all along .
but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .
and that 's why change is fundamental in story .
if things go static , stories die , because life is never static .
have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be ?
but under that was this global tension of will we ever find nemo in this huge , vast ocean ?
but we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation .
that just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story .
mr. potato head : you going to make us , woody ?
bambi : yippee !
and that 's what i think the magic ingredient is , the secret sauce , is can you invoke wonder .
the best stories infuse wonder .
( applause )
`` and that was , `` '' how did this happen to me ? '' '' and in fact , what did happen to my brain ? ''
and so i decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
about 900 people died that day , most of them taking their own lives .
the bottom picture is hitler youth .
a few months ago the nobel prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
in part two , i 'll offer a solution to that mystery .
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
and they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
what 's pushing on it ?
similarly , the astronomers ' results are surely well-deserving of the nobel prize , but they raised an analogous question .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
you see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
and the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
now you might wonder , should you care ?
these little fundamental strings , when they vibrate in different patterns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electrons , quarks , neutrinos , photons , all other particles would be united into a single framework , as they would all arise from vibrating strings .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
but others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
here 's the idea .
because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
and that 's a question on which we can make headway .
but the point is , if the feature you 're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided .
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate countless other big bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
going further , if there are other universes , the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide .
but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
i suspect the latter .
why ca n't we solve these problems ?
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
would n't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?
as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida , we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist , and he was working on a pretty incredible thing .
we want to talk about storing energy , and unfortunately the best thing we 've got going is something that was developed in france a hundred and fifty years ago , the lead acid battery .
19 trillion dollars is what we 're going to have to spend .
we 're simply not going to do that .
and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world .
`` and whenever i go round to somebody who says , `` '' you know what , you 're working on something that 's too difficult . ''
now , that early universe was incredibly dense , like a metal , way denser , and if you hit it , it would ring , but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself , and the hammer would be quantum mechanics .
but the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , roiling pot of universal stuff .
and when he looked at that equation , it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force .
it took so long to get these ants to do this .
( laughter ) but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts : big and small . and the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see , but there might be additional dimensions curled up , sort of like the circular part of that cable , so small that they have so far remained invisible .
deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
but if there 's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we wo n't see them either . that is true .
not yet .
this is a deep question .
consider this . if you look at the instrument , a french horn , notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument .
how would we know it ?
let me show you that idea visually .
you take these particles . you slam them together .
and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .
amazing possibility .
i was the son of an aerospace engineer .
that place is called the stratosphere .
it was a reference from a friend of mine to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation , and i asked him the question : is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere ?
and he said it was .
three years later , this is what we have .
they had never sold a suit commercially , only to the government , but they sold one to me , which i am very grateful for .
it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body .
that 's a helium truck in the background .
the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway .
so the trip up is beautiful . it 's kind of like google earth in reverse .
you can see how the fields in the background are relatively big at this point , and you can see me going up and up .
this is my flight director telling me that i had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon , and i was about 4,000 feet from release .
you can see the darkness of space , the curvature of the earth , the fragile planet below .
i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now .
( video ) ground control . everyone ready ?
right now , i 'm about at the speed of sound .
this is my landing , but it 's probably more properly called a crash .
i love things that are alive .
and when i talk about darwinian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fittest .
and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
think about evolution in terms of offspring competing , and some winning .
so bearing that in mind , as a chemist , i wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology : what is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo darwinian evolution ?
but when i saw this , i was really fascinated , because it seemed lifelike .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let 's go one step further .
`` is life that improbable ? '' '' and this is really the question . ''
let 's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
well what about matter ?
but before we can make life , let 's think for a second what life really is characterized by .
well , i like think of it as a flame in a bottle .
and from this stuff we came .
we then got to the last ancestor .
now talking about e.t . putting us there , or some other life , just pushes the problem further on .
and the answer , of course , lies with mice .
because if i want evolution , i need containers to compete .
but we need to make some containers .
let 's zoom out to what that could mean .
and that 's really worth thinking about .
and we do n't use design anymore . we find what works .
we really struggle to do this .
when ?
lee cronin : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for .
and because we shared our genetic information with linda , she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna — haplotype k1a1b1a — which meant that we were distantly related .
what i 'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
and one of the major things we can do we 've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .
what if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health , leveraging technology as well ?
so if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible .
and now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
the scan of today takes up about 800 books , or 20 gigabytes .
how do you leverage that information ?
we 're moving , obviously , to the era of the tricorder .
and now , of course , we 're in the era of the ipad , even the ipad 2 .
so certainly , the physicians of today , including myself , are completely reliable on these devices .
`` and as you saw just about a month ago , watson from ibm beat the two champions in `` '' jeopardy . '' '' so i want you to imagine when in a couple of years , when we 've started to apply this cloud-based information , when we really have the a.i . physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done . ''
we can actually now visit our patients robotically — this is the rp7 ; if i 'm a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital .
so instead of wearing these kludgy devices , we can put on a simple patch .
i can get insight into that on a daily basis .
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies .
a surgeon in new york can be helping a surgeon in amsterdam , for example .
now how about controlling other elements ?
now how about other exponentials ?
here 's one that 's in prototyping by medtronic that 's smaller than a penny .
artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it 's going to become increasingly participatory .
through websites like patients like me or managing your data on microsoft healthvault or google health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
we 'd like to get therapies better and more effective .
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
we 've learned at stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells , the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse .
the cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later .
now i 'll close with regenerative medicine .
we 've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
but where is stem cell therapy really going ?
but i think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
it 's in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
i think it 's time for us to apply them to water .
well , you can imagine the delight over at general drafting .
`` they immediately call rand mcnally , and they say , `` '' we 've caught you ! we made agloe , new york , up . ''
it is a fake place . it 's a paper town .
my gpa was consistently in the low 2s .
`` and i said , `` '' i do n't know , like , six hours ? '' '' and he said , `` '' do you realize that if you 'd worked at baskin-robbins those six hours , you could have made 30 dollars , so in some ways , you just paid thirty dollars to play super mario kart . '' '' and i was , like , `` '' i 'll take that deal . '' '' ( laughter ) but i learned what opportunity cost is . ''
`` so , i had one learning community in high school , then i went to another for college , and then i went to another , when i started working at a magazine called `` '' booklist , '' '' where i was an assistant , surrounded by astonishingly well-read people . ''
contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place , so are these people .
sometimes improvements were made — even the sphinx got a nose job .
we turned the earth into a sandwich , by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the earth , and on the exact opposite point of the earth , have another person holding a piece of bread .
follow the calculus tag on tumblr , and yes , you will see people complaining about calculus , but you 'll also see people re-blogging those complaints , making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful , and here 's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable .
but , you might ask , why was the higgs boson included in the standard model , alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks , if it had n't been discovered back then in the 1970s ?
we 'll talk more about this in a later video , but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s , in the equations , the higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force , that until now we 've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence .
`` jg : and lastly , here 's destin , from `` '' smarter every day , '' '' talking about the conservation of angular momentum , and , since it 's youtube , cats : ( video ) hey , it 's me , destin . welcome back to `` '' smarter every day . '' '' so you 've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet . ''
and because i 'm in comments usually , i get to participate with you .
( laughter ) and i truly , truly believe that when we invented agloe , new york , in the 1960s , when we made agloe real , we were just getting started .
`` who is ever going to hire me ? '' '' and that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion , and frankly , by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century . ''
what policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way ?
so if i asked you , for example , what was the obama administration policy that caused massive changes across the country , what would you say ?
why ? the government put a $ 4.5 billion pot and said to the governors across the country , compete for it .
it 's a rounding error on the federal side .
we want to bring jobs . i 'm just saying .
congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table ?
`` they ca n't agree to anything . '' '' so you could wait and go through congress , although you should be very impatient . ''
and i do n't know about you , but i prefer to dine .
thank you all so much . ( applause )
`` and as it ran , this thing was saying , `` '' give me input . give me input . '' '' and i suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing . ''
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue .
and this is about 23 years into this process .
thank you very much for your time .
and it 's incredible to watch , but there 's nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it 's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what 's going on around it .
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise .
so , cut to the modern day .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
lego made it accessible .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick .
we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
( applause )
because of this lack of wealth , we lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth , and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth .
i know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student , and now as a teacher , i do n't have access to those same tools to give my students .
i mean , really .
a little-known secret in american history is that the only american institution created specifically for people of color is the american slave trade — and some would argue the prison system , but that 's another topic for another ted talk .
ever since then , every court case , educational policy , reform , has been an attempt to retrofit the design , rather than just stopping and acknowledging : we 've had it all wrong from the beginning .
some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place .
they know that when it comes to schooling , black lives do n't matter and they never have .
`` ( laughter ) now when i say , `` '' take out a book and read , '' '' kids rush to my library . ''
`` we get to a catastrophe and we wonder , `` how did it get so bad ? how did we get here ? '' ''
close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter .
and on a micro level : if you 're a human being , donate .
i 'll tell you : they 're my kids .
in fact , i 'm not very interested in parenting , per se .
`` they 're a little old before their time , wishing the grown-ups in their lives had said , `` '' what you 've done is enough , this effort you 've put forth in childhood is enough . '' '' and they 're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering , will this life ever turn out to have been worth it ? ''
what i 'm saying is , when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood , all in furtherance of some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers , that that 's too narrow a definition of success for our kids .
our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores .
the longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the harvard grant study .
a second very important finding from the harvard grant study said that happiness in life comes from love , not love of work , love of humans : our spouse , our partner , our friends , our family .
and more importantly , if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college , whichever one it is , well , they 'll have gone there on their own volition , fueled by their own desire , capable and ready to thrive there .
soon after that , a disgraced pop science writer called jonah lehrer — he 'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes , and he was drenched in shame and regret , he told me .
`` ( laughter ) and , `` '' jonah lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame . '' '' that one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever , to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern . ''
we were getting jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege , but jonah was on the floor then , and we were still kicking , and congratulating ourselves for punching up .
and it began to feel weird and empty when there was n't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get .
`` it did mine , and i thought what everybody thought that night , which was , `` '' wow , somebody 's screwed ! ''
it started to get darker : [ everyone go report this cunt @ justinesacco ] then came the calls for her to be fired .
before that , she worked with adults with learning difficulties , and was apparently really good at her job .
word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire desmond sacco .
thank you .
in your book , you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm , and by creating blogs and posting nice , innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff , managed to get the story off the first couple pages of google results , but it did n't last long .
`` as soon as i say , `` '' we are the powerful people abusing our power now , '' '' i get people saying , `` '' well you must be a racist too . '' '' bg : so the other night — yesterday — we were at dinner , and there were two discussions going on . ''
on the other , every time you turned to your phone , there is this deluge of insults .

over 50 percent of managers are women these days , and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade , all but two of them are dominated by women .
so the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture — what our romantic comedies look like , what our marriages look like , what our dating lives look like , and our new set of superheroes .
but the difference is that , back then , it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires , whereas this time , it 's not about passion , and it 's not about any kind of movement .
and i realized that two things were different this time around .
and labor statistics : women take up most managerial jobs .
that particular headline comes to me from a market research firm .
and they expected that it would be young families , or young men , just like it had always been .
and basically what you 'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .
now what does that mean ?
but this process is affecting men very differently than it 's affecting women .
there we go .
it used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who did n't have a college degree , but you had a specific set of skills , and with the help of a union , you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life .
this new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength , which is what 's helped men along all these years .
`` if you read management books now , a leader is somebody who can foster creativity , who can get his — get the employees — see , i still say `` '' his '' '' — who can get the employees to talk to each other , who can basically build teams and get them to be creative . ''
and then on top of that , that 's created a kind of cascading effect .
women enter the workplace at the top , and then at the working class , all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home .
and here the story is fairly simple .
people have asked men , why do n't they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
so for some reason men just do n't end up going back to college .
or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?
certainly , when i was in college , i had certain expectations about my life — that my husband and i would both work , and that we would equally raise the children .
but these college girls had a completely different view of their future .
and this was kind of a shocker to me .
over several decades , south korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about .
and if women failed to birth male children , they were basically treated like domestic servants .
but over the '70s and '80s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce .
`` now they 've been asking a question since 1985 : `` how strongly do you prefer a first-born son ? '' ''
now because we have n't fully processed this information , it 's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
and they come up in lots of different forms .
you 've got our new james bond , who 's angelina jolie .
it 's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it 's also pretty exhilarating , because it 's beautiful up there , and you 're looking out on a beautiful view .
he lived in a fairly wealthy home .
`` `` '' light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history . '' '' it was n't until much longer , much later , that darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans . ''
if only darwin had nasa .
this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .
so , it 's wonderful . we evolved this very protective , wonderful covering of melanin .
here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity .
now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences .
some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low-uv areas .
vitamin d deficiency creeps up on people , and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones , to their gradual decay of their immune systems , or loss of immune function , and probably some problems with their mood and health , their mental health .
evolution helps us .
some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect .
diamorphine is heroin .
if you do that , the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly .
crucially , they 've got loads of friends . they can have loads of sex .
and they 've got both the water bottles , the normal water and the drugged water .
in vietnam , 20 percent of all american troops were using loads of heroin , and if you look at the news reports from the time , they were really worried , because they thought , my god , we 're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the united states when the war ends ; it made total sense .
and at first , i found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around , but one way that helped me to think about it is , i can see , i 've got over by my seat a bottle of water , right ?
forget the drugs . forget the drug war .
now , this has really significant implications .
the most obvious implications are for the war on drugs .
we punish them . we shame them . we give them criminal records .
that number has been declining steadily since the 1950s .
i wanted to know how to help the people i love .
i think everything in our lives is defined by reality tv , but that 's another ted talk .
so i was thinking , how could i be portuguese ?
or perhaps not quite on earth .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
yakima canutt really formed the stunt fight .
car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us , and safer .
but now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon .
it 's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape .
that 's the only reason we do it . see , it 's all fun , this job .
this is joe kittenger himself .
he 's in his 80s and he lives in florida . he 's a tremendous guy .
you need a pressure breathing system with a g suit that squeezes you , that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale .
above 50,000 feet you need a space suit , a pressure suit .
i 've found that team in america now .
if you 're at 100,000 feet you die .
the body swells up . it 's awful .
thank you very much .
the status of my mission at the moment is it still needs a major sponsor .
well it means growing an actual heart , let 's say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
it 's amazing that these cells beat at all .
but what 's really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
there was another object , this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity — pretty scary stuff , when you 're a little kid .
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland .
so , i created this compilation of the two : i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there , and some foot straps , and some metal fins , and here i was , going really fast on frozen lakes .
it was really a death trap . i mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
this is a watch we made for mini cooper , the car company , right when it launched , and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical .
and other projects , which were really about transformation , about matching the human need .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for herman miller .
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light , a new experience of light .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
and this is what we 're pursuing here .
it 's really about designing from the inside out .
and then , on the other side of the room , the designers are making small adjustments , sketching , drawing by hand , putting it in the computer .
and then , of course , design is never done .
and this is — the other new way that is unique in how we work is , because it 's never done , you have to do all this other stuff .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
but when nicholas negroponte — and he has spoken about this project a lot , he 's the founder of olpc — came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
but what he said was really significant , is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product , how we were going to make it low cost , robust .
( laughter ) and it was a prototype . and a month and a half later , i come back to switzerland , and there he is playing with his own version . ( laughter )
and i was just in new york at the launch , and i went to see all these places where they 're installed : this is at a puerto rican little mom-and-pop store ; at a bar in christopher street ; at a pool hall .
i mean , they 're being installed in homeless clinics — everywhere .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i 'm not sure it 's the etiquette here .
they were living in hungary , and my mother was born .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
`` and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called `` '' the hot zone . '' '' it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus . ''
i was a passive observer of the medical world .
`` and being naive about the whole field , i kind of thought , `` '' oh , you have cell death in alzheimer 's which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound — purine derivatives — that are promoting cell growth . '' '' and so i thought , `` '' maybe if it can promote cell growth , it can inhibit cell death , too . '' '' and so that 's the project that i pursued for that year , and it 's continuing now as well , and found that a specific purine derivative called `` '' guanidine '' '' had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent . ''
so , if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it 's initiating cancer , it 's almost as if this is a repair response .
it 's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
but then again , this fact that the metastases did n't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .
and you think , the more highways there are in a tissue , the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases .
so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors , and another organ — a distant organ somewhere in the body — will have the corresponding chemokines , and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it .
and the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle — there 's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured , that 's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle .
maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells , and this is why it seems as if it is so rare .
( laughter ) these are expressions of truth as awe-full things , by meaning they are things you can worship .
they power how a cell replicates . they power our hearts .
and so what i 'm going to show you is a three-minute reader 's digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced . it 's an ongoing project that 's going to go another four or five years .
run the movie , please .
the good news is i 'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i 'm the only thing standing between you and the bar .
( laughter ) and the good news is i do n't have a prepared speech , but i have a box of slides .
manchester craftsmen 's guild is named after my neighborhood .
that 's intentional .
what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life .
they did all right in the ketchup business .
and i happen to know that company pretty well because john heinz , who was our u.s. senator — who was tragically killed in a plane accident — he had heard about my desire to build a new building , because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site .
and most importantly , he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company .
and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america , which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools , and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
that boy won a four-year scholarship on the strength of that photograph .
we have smoked salmon at the art openings , we have a formal printed invitation , and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) i ca n't get these parents to come to the school . '' '' he said , `` '' i 'll get them to come to the school . '' '' so , he jumped in the van , he went to miss jones ' house and said , `` '' miss jones , i knew you wanted to come to your kid 's art opening but you probably did n't have a ride . ''
at the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up and we did n't pick up one parent .
we got it just done in time to show you , so it 's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center .
and that was our first recording studio , which was the broom closet .
and i love them because they pay the rent on time .
( laughter ) and as a result of the association , i 'm now a director of the mellon financial corporation that bought dreyfus .
and we 're going to have high school kids growing phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city .
and along the way , i met this real short guy at my slide show in the silicon valley .
it 's 40,000 dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school .
we 're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed , charged and intimidated by their own governments , many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror .
just three examples .
more recently , the turkish representative for reporters without borders , erol önderoglu , has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda , because he and some other activists have been supporting kurdish media .
i am a vicar in the church of england .
he will protect his own people , and answer the prayers of the faithful .
`` and in the worship of my church , the most frequently used adjective about god is `` '' almighty . '' '' but i have a problem with that . ''
exploring the feminine , nurturing side of divinity .
the essence of what he said was this : the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how god let this happen .
a verbal response would not be appropriate .
this is true . and yet here we are , my church in oxford , semi-detached from events that happened a long way away , but with our faith bruised .
over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate , a bit dodgy .
that 's just not acceptable to intelligent christians , and we must acknowledge it .
a god who looks after his own , so that christians are ok , while everyone else perishes ?
`` in his great novel , `` '' the brothers karamazov , '' '' dostoevsky gives these words to ivan , addressed to his naive and devout younger brother , alyosha : `` '' if the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth , then i say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price . ''
`` i merely , most respectfully , return him the ticket . '' '' or perhaps god set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever , so that natural processes could occur , and evolution run its course . ''
how does this in-ness , this innerness , this interiority of god work ?
`` in the end , we have to say , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' if we knew , god would not be god . ''
and how would we live such a faith ? how would i live such a faith ?
and how would one deepen such a faith ?
no neat packages of faith , with bible references to prove them .
thank you .
( shooting noises ) the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
well , i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
that 's a statement about vision .
we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
and it 's better in two different ways .
`` [ `` '' blue '' '' ] db : yellow . ''
okay , you get my point , right ? ( laughter ) you 're getting better , but it 's hard . why is it hard ?
was it yellow initially or blue ?
i hear a few yellow . good . so most of you have a brain . ( laughter ) i 'm now going to ask you to do the task , but now with a little more challenging task . there are going to be three of them that are blue . do n't move your eyes .
what is multimedia-tasking ? it 's the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they 're doing search on the web at the same time as they 're chatting on facebook with their friends .
when we measure them in the lab , they 're really bad .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
`` so you show them their data , you show them they are bad and they 're like , `` '' not possible . '' '' you know , they have this sort of gut feeling that , really , they are doing really , really good . ''
one more . get those brains working . come on .
they do n't play 10 hours of action games in a row .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
that 's the chocolate side of the equation .
the first time i saw poverty , and poverty 's face , was when i was six or seven years old , early 1970s .
`` if you ask americans , `` '' has poverty gotten worse or better around the world ? `` `` , 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s . ''
at its best , it 's about aspiration , which is what so many people on this stage talk about , is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system .
and conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty .
we need investment overseas in a sustainable , responsible , ethical and moral way . yes . yes .
you know , all of us in this room , we 're blessed .
specifically , i as a person who 's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life , am firmly of the belief that photography , video , film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature .
whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less ?
all of that , strip it away . in the world of the arctic and alpine environments , where the ice is , it 's real and it 's present .
some of them shoot every half hour , every 15 minutes , every five minutes .
there 's a lot of people working on this right now .
we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere , watching what 's happened .
this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time .
you can see that from the orange line and the blue line .
right now , if you look at the top right part of that graph , we 're at 385 parts per million .
this is not a little cliff . this is like a major office building in an urban center .
particularly in the world of sea ice , the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago , and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with .
and you see where it ended in these various spring days , june , may , then october .
geologic process in action here .
no . it was retreating through the winter because it 's an unhealthy glacier .
you can see it deflating .
the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the ilulissat glacier .
we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago , as you can see . june 25th , monster calving events happened .
and by the age of 11 , i was no longer going to sunday mass , and going on birdwatching walks with my father .
and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes , and it had to be present on a molecule . i 'd never really thought of molecules before .
you know chromosomes , but this was a molecule , and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form . and there was the big question of , how did you copy the information ?
and it was at indiana i got the impression that , you know , the gene was likely to be dna .
you can read it in about two hours .
and there was an unexpected speaker who was n't on the program , and he talked about dna .
so i went to cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography . and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
they said it was lousy , and it was .
so we were told to build no more models ; we were incompetent .
he 'll build a model , and then we 're going to be scooped .
`` we rushed over to the chemistry department and said , `` '' could pauling be right ? '' '' and alex hust said , `` '' no . '' '' so we were happy . ''
`` and so bragg said , `` '' build models . '' '' and a month after we got the pauling manuscript — i should say i took the manuscript to london , and showed the people . ''
well , we got the answer on the 28th february '53 .
he said they were wrong .
and we knew it was big because , you know , if you just put a next to t and g next to c , you have a copying mechanism .
so we saw how genetic information is carried .
it 's the order of the four bases .
and you copy it by going from strand-separating .
for about three years we just — i tried to solve the structure of rna .
it was really , you know , sort of a shitty time .
but that 's the only — no , we were only photographed twice .
and , boom , we 've , you know , had a biotech industry . and , but we were still a long ways from , you know , answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood , which is : how do you nature-nurture ?
now , so , our autism study is just beginning . we got three million dollars .
it 's a wonderful way to find genes .
and so , i 'll conclude by saying we 've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
and what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure , and whether this is one that predisposes — and then there 's only a sub-segment of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic .
i thank you .
older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain .
is it teenage years ? is it middle age ?
we asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years .
here 's what we found .
first of all , you are right , change does slow down as we age , but second , you 're wrong , because it does n't slow nearly as much as we think .
you can ask people about their likes and dislikes , their basic preferences .
is this just a form of mis-prediction that does n't have consequences ?
it bedevils our decision-making in important ways .
it transforms our preferences .
the person you are right now is as transient , as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been .
and i thought to myself , would n't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton ?
( laughter ) i want to point out here at this point that i 've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell , and this was the very latest one .
no dice : no dodo skeleton for me . but the damage had been done .
i bought some super sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
and one of the other things i 'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
this guy — i love this guy ! he put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler .
and so now it was time to do some research .
i 'd bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the maltese falcon on ebay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
it was made out of resin , which was n't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made .
so now , i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon .
i spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass-smooth .
oh , finishing up with triple-zero steel wool .
and they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years , until it got stolen in january of 2007 .
( laughter ) ( applause ) there you can see , it 's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds .
there 's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography master of this , which i will polish , then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze . or : there are several people who own originals , and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner
that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , i swear , get a perfect 3d scan . and i 'm even willing to sign pages saying that i 'll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , i promise .
we 've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising .
well , not quite , not quite perfect .
they do n't understand .
yes , put that aside .
now , back in the 1960s africa not only fed itself , it also exported food .
`` the next chapter begins with first of all , asking ourselves this fundamental question , `` whom do we want to help in africa ? '' ''
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people .
and if you look at them , the slate of the post-colonial leaders — an assortment of military fufu heads , swiss-bank socialists , crocodile liberators , vampire elites , quack revolutionaries .
now , obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people , you go where the people are .
all right , you can not develop africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors .
if not , the people will abandon the chief , go somewhere else and set up a new settlement .
now , compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa .
it is a total far cry .
you see , in the west , the basic economic and social unit is the individual .
go back to africa 's indigenous institutions , and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors , the traditional sectors .
he 's getting no assistance from the government , and he 's building a second , bigger boat .
it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians .
this is where we need to mobilize africans , in the diaspora especially , to invest in this .
thank you very much .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
in fact , we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom .
and inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .
dr. boyce , at the university of chicago , published an article in the journal of geology this past year determining that prototaxites was a giant fungus , a giant mushroom .
all across most land masses .
so , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , i think , is a forgone conclusion , at least in my own mind .
the mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom — it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
whereas the other three piles were dead , dark and stinky , and the pah 's — the aromatic hydrocarbons — went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
these are gateway species , vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities .
may not seem that large — let 's get closer .
this is extremely rare fungus .
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .
and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
so , i went to the epa homepage , and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants , as well as termites .
then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
the life box — you 're gon na be getting a dvd of the ted conference — you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
i want to reinvent the delivery system , and the use of cardboard around the world , so they become ecological footprints .
if there 's a youtube-like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zip code specific — where people could join together , and through satellite imaging systems , through virtual earth or google earth , you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes .
then you can harvest the kernels , and then you just need a few kernels .
now , three corncobs , no other grain — lots of mushrooms begin to form .
but watch what happens here .
but to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent , and i think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels .
all ages , solo play , body play , games , taunting .
north of churchill , manitoba , in october and november , there 's no ice on hudson bay .
and this polar bear that you see , this 1200-pound male , he 's wild and fairly hungry .
and from out of stage left comes this wild , male polar bear , with a predatory gaze .
that fixed behavior — which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal — changes .
a play ballet .
they 're in a state of play .
now how did i get involved in this ?
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
when that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile , what happens — spontaneously — is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother .
and so now i 'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it 's never just singularly one thing .
we 're going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
and — they do n't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
and social play is part of what we 're about here today , and is a byproduct of the play scene .
rough and tumble play .
these lionesses , seen from a distance , looked like they were fighting .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment — rare — where the red sox won the world series .
three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum , puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe — the executive portion — helps contextual memory be developed , and — and , and , and .
so it 's — for me , its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that 's associated with play , and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines had n't really thought of it that way .
i 'm sorry i do n't have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
now , this is a consequence of play deprivation . ( laughter ) this took a long time — i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple eegs , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
and the thing that 's so unique about our species is that we 're really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
i think we 've got a lot of learning to do .
now , there is a way of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here , which is the play history .
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington , d.c .
`` most of us work with groups , and i put this up because the d.school , the design school at stanford , thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment , has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called `` '' from play to innovation . '' '' and you 'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play , which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking : `` '' to explore play behavior , its development and its biological basis ; to apply those principles , through design thinking , to promote innovation in the corporate world ; ''
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
the wearable meeting .
because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .
but when you take it off — that 's when the real action happens .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) stuart brown : so i would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential — where you set aside time to play — but where your life becomes infused minute by minute , hour by hour , with body , object , social , fantasy , transformational kinds of play .
and i think you 'll have a better and more empowered life .
sb : yeah , i do n't think that 's accurate , and i think probably because animals have taught us that .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
so it 's not just something you do in your spare time .
sb : well , i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners — who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever — a state of play .
you 've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology , it 's almost as if men are from mars and women are from venus .
any psychologist will tell you that men are better at spatial awareness than women — so things like map-reading , for example — and it 's true , but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
so here 's performance on the standardized grammar test .
let 's psychoanalyze you using the famous rorschach inkblot test .
put your hands up if you think they are high-fiving .
okay . what if you think they 're fighting ?
in fact , one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose people 's personalities using rorschach inkblot tests , schizophrenia was diagnosed in about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants .
so if you did n't do that well on this , maybe you are not a very visual type of person .
so let 's do another quick quiz to find out .
when making a cake , do you prefer to — so hands up for each one again — do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures ?
except , of course , as you 've probably guessed , that it does n't , because the whole thing is a complete myth .
could you learn to drive a car , for example , just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience ?
i know many of you are a-level students that will have recently gotten your gcse results .
well , when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment , what we can do is do a twin study .
and it turns out that it 's about 58 percent due to genes .
maybe we could listen to a nice bit of mozart .
this suggests that mozart should have bit more careful , perhaps , when choosing his sexual partners .
but in fact , the data do n't back this up .
this idea , the effect that punishment can improve performance , is what participants thought they were testing in milgram 's famous learning and punishment experiment that you 've probably heard about if you 're a psychology student .
and thirdly , participants did n't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to .
thank you .
( applause )
interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth .
some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much , and reading comprehension measured by third parties — not by us — skyrockets .
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
`` so we 're once again doing `` '' give one , get one . '' '' last year , we ran a `` '' give one , get one '' '' program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free . ''
you vaccinate all the children in an area .
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
the finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there 's a very high suicide rate , but by golly , they are qualified .
at the age of 14 , in common with many 14-year-olds in the brazilian education system , he dropped out of school .
he employed 200 people .
that name should tell you that the kenyan education system borrows almost everything from britain , circa 1950 , but has managed to make it even worse .
so there are schools in slums like this .
they 're private schools . there are no state schools in slums .
the reason they went on studying was this .
so if you look , as i did , through this tour , and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions , look at the recipes that they come up with for learning , they look nothing like school .
most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
many of them do n't have electricity at home .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
one is to deliver extrinsic motivation , that education has a payoff .
in the schools and communities that taio works in , the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question .
he 'd spent three years in nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of aids .
and i learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
and what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise .
and it 's the same wherever you go .
yet , everyone knows what is a chinese restaurant .
these people work with the chinese restaurant model — same principles , different applications and different settings — not the mcdonald 's model .
so mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century .
most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
so we certainly need more of that .
the most famous of these is reggio emilia in italy , the family-based learning system to support and encourage people in schools .
it will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
i 'm talking about before pagers .
and i said , you know what ? we got ta do something different .
i had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that i had been trained to do .
we had to change it .
and so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily .
because here 's the crazy thing : in law enforcement , we have evolved into something incredible .
and so , as i try to hurry and get through this , i need to say this : it 's not just law enforcement , though .
everybody makes up a community .
there is no way in the world that we , as a community , should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street .
it was the parental figures in the community .
and it might go back further , but the problem is , we only started keeping data since 1970 .
( applause ) god bless you . ( applause )
some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored .
and yes , i worry we could screw up mars the way we 've screwed up earth .
he excited an entire generation to dream .
perhaps then we will look back at earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at earth , as we struggle to survive on mars , and realize how precious the home planet is .
seasons and years on mars are twice as long as they are on earth .
now , as you can see , mars is n't exactly earth-like , but it 's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system .
here 's the problem .
but the last saturn v was used in 1973 to launch the skylab space station , and we decided to do something called the shuttle instead of continuing on to mars after we landed on the moon .
how soon will the first humans actually land here ?
that is spacex 's falcon 9 rocket , lifting six tons of supplies to the international space station .
let 's look at the problem this way .
so let 's look at the most important thing on this list first .
now , here 's a view of a little dig the phoenix lander did in 2008 , showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice — that white stuff is ice .
i love this thing .
on mars there 's hardly any atmospheric pressure .
that sounds like a lot of hubris , but the truth is that the technology to do everything i 'm about to tell you already exists .
as the atmosphere gets thicker , everything gets better .
it will rain and it will snow on mars .
eventually , mars will be made to feel a lot like british columbia .
it 's going to be the same as it is on earth .
someone will make documentary movies of mars and sell them on earth .
ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to mars .
thank you .
( applause )
oh , very , very good .
look here . this is how it was in 1975 .
it 's the number of people on each income , from one dollar a day — ( applause ) see , there was one hump here , around one dollar a day , and then there was one hump here somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars .
now , this is what the u.s. public and the swedish answered .
`` so ola told me , `` '' take these devices . ''
fortunately , i will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault , actually .
so this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle .
and they are exaggerated , and especially things we 're afraid of .
the trends that are increasing are instead falling , and the other way around , and in this case , the chimps use our intuition against us , and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength .
there is , of course , one way , which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports .
that will help you score better on our tests .
( applause ) that was the first one .
no , no , no . that 's wrong .
let 's look at the last one .
i would say yes , extremely important , for the same reason .
i did that , but i went even further .
i used those five years for the next 20 years with the same speed , just as an experiment what might actually happen .
in 2025 , 63 percent .
2030 , 68. and in 2035 , the west is outnumbered in the rich consumer market .
we are here today because [ the ] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .
and the reason i really like these goals is that there are eight of them .
so there 's good news .
are they alive ?
but these surveys are costly , so they can only be done [ in ] three- to five-year intervals .
i was so happy .
there was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
and there was socio-economic problems , which are now being solved at a much better scale .
and [ the ] u.n. says it 's a reduction with 1.8 percent .
so we calculate the percent reduction per year , but it 's sort of the same percentage .
and i 'm now giving you a wider picture than the mdg .
i can tell you that the economy in greece and sweden are very different — everyone knows that .
my country , sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
these were bad years , and people got fed up with sweden .
and here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later .
and sweden never reached [ the ] millennium development goal rate , 3.1 percent when i calculated .
and down they went , you know .
the relationship between child mortality and family size .
this is , once again , 1960 — 50 years ago .
here we come down with the eradication of smallpox , better education , health service .
this is the vision we have , is n't it .
this page is very bad ; it 's a categorization of countries .
we have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
that 's why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
( applause )
but it started with some practical problems .
i would n't know a good novel from namibia .
then it was friends of friends .
she said she loved the sound of my project , could she go to her local english-language bookshop and choose my malaysian book and post it to me ?
i accepted enthusiastically , and a few weeks later , a package arrived containing not one , but two books — rafidah 's choice from malaysia , and a book from singapore that she had also picked out for me .
time and again , people went out of their way to help me .
morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way .
it was as though the world 's stories and the people who 'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me .
the career that i started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places , and at that time i was working in the antarctic and the arctic , and high deserts and low deserts .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they 're absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet .
particularly mars , but also europa , the small , icy moon around jupiter .
notably mars , as a first example .
and a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids .
and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
and when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
and that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective , to try to then think about the way our planet behaves , as a planet , and with the life that 's on it .
so why might it be hard to find ?
is it bigger than the biggest bacterium ? we do n't know .
so , perspective is everything and , because of the history that i 've just briefly talked to you about , i have learned to think about earth as an extraterrestrial planet .
well , this is what we apply to our work .
because contrary to what you might think , this is not devoid of life .
the extremes on earth are interesting in their own right , but one of the reasons that we 're interested in them is because they represent , really , the average conditions that we may expect on other planets .
there 's so much life in this cave , and i ca n't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you .
this stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old 's nose when he has a cold .
in fact , there 's so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there 's actually a huge number of cavefish .
and every time they do that , they get a tiny little packet of energy .
so , lava-tube caves— i 've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet .
these are hopping microbot swarms .
and so , one can send a thousand of them , as you can see in this upper left-hand picture , a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers .
and the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on mars .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
so , in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation , our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can , more than ever before , express our desires and our concerns .
there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly , truly dislike , and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic . that we shun commitment .
but , can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend , physically , a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever ?
but in order to be part of this conversation , we need to know what we want to do next , because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction .
my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests , protests that were able to successfully impose agendas , roll back extremely pernicious legislation , and even overthrow authoritarian governments .
and so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers , like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes .
so the question i 'd like to raise here , and i do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer , is this one : if internet is the new printing press , then what is democracy for the internet era ?
i do n't have the answer , just in case .
it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement .
and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue , you can always delegate your vote to someone else , allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership .
`` we said , `` '' look , here you have a platform that you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies . '' '' and yes , we failed . ''
we were sent to play outside like little kids .
amongst other things , we were called naive .
for the first time , we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions .
but a real challenge is to find , to design to create , to empower those connectors that are able to innovate , to transform noise and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies to the 21st century .
thank you .
( applause )
several years ago here at ted , peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jockey for power .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti , inc. right ?
because they have special skills of facilitation .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
what do you think happened then ?
there 's world records that are on this as well .
and that can make a big difference .
and then , when i returned to work full time , in this role , i joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions .
the answer to this question is on your calendar .
♫ young man , you were surfin ' along ♫ ♫ and then , young man , you downloaded a song ♫ ♫ and then , dumb man , copied it to your 'pod ♫ ♫ then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫ ♫ you 've just been sued by the r-i-a-a ♫ ♫ you 've just been screwed by the r-i-a-a ♫ ♫ their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫ ♫ and there 'd better not be a next time ♫ ♫ they 've lost their minds at the r-i-a-a ♫ ♫ justice is blind at the r-i-a-a ♫ ♫ you 're depriving the bands ♫ ♫ you are learning to steal ♫
♫ maybe whistling a tune ♫ ♫ maybe humming along ♫ ♫ maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫
and that 's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times .
i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that 's in this picture , but if you look very carefully , there is a jaw , a lower jaw , of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at lake turkana on the west side .
today , we 've got great technology : we have gps .
and we can bring all this information into big gis packages , today .
and here 's a very special moment , when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors .
and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother .
( laughter ) ok , so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors , because it 's incredibly difficult , a , for these things to become — to be — preserved , and secondly , for them to have been brought back up to the surface .
but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya , essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains .
well , shortly afterwards , members of his species started to move northwards out of africa , and you start to see fossils of homo erectus in georgia , china and also in parts of indonesia .
as al gore so clearly has reminded us , we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet .
i mean , these are extraordinary numbers .
we all have an african origin .
we could tell every single human being out there , if we really wanted to .
i 'm going to talk about save more tomorrow .
so let 's think about how we manage our money .
and then they foreclose .
no one .
two thirds are not saving now .
we think we have a problem of people saving too much .
what are we going to do about it ?
and then count down the days and see what people ended up eating .
the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later .
let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia .
but again , a little diversion to the topic of organ donation .
`` and in germany , if you would like to donate your organs — god forbid something really bad happens to you — when you get your driving license or an i.d. , you check the box saying , `` i would like to donate my organs . '' ''
doing nothing is very common .
twelve percent are organ donors .
they 're really mad .
and we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called save more , not today , tomorrow .
once you tell me you would like to save more in the future , let 's say every january you 're going to be saving more automatically and it 's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401 ( k ) plan before you see it , before you touch it , before you get the issue of immediate gratification .
message two is there 's still a lot to do .
if you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it , we need to think about that .
if you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets , we need to think about that .
we 've got a lot to do , a lot to solve , also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement .
how many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post-retirement decisions .
there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
now this region 's very diverse , and every country is unique .
but it 's the largest arab country and it 's also one with a great deal of influence .
in fact , it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
but it was n't just anger at economic injustice .
i have a vision for each one of you , and the vision i have for you is that when you wake up in the morning , your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do ; that as you go through the day , you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that 's been bestowed on you ; that as you go through the day , you become radiantly alive several times .
when i conduct this experiment , a bunch of stuff comes up : vast wealth , trophy spouse , good health , lots of travel , time , etc , etc , etc .
it is hardwired into you . it is part of your dna .
and the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model .
all of this is a variation of the if-then model .
and the if-then model is : if this happens , then we will be happy .
what we do n't realize is the model itself is flawed .
can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity ?
and if you remember that — raise your hands if you could .
in fact , you 're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different .
you know , we are here and we want to have something .
the outcome is completely out of your control .
`` and when he presented the gift to his wife , her immediate reaction was , `` after 20 years of marriage , you do n't know my size ? '' ''
you invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration , angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck .
`` but i would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of , you will find the score to your liking . '' '' that is investing in a process . ''
investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being .
how long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that , if every three times she fell down , you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on ?
`` but if , on the other hand , we said , `` '' here is the outcome , i am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit i could , '' '' every day is a blast , and you 're well on your way to achieving the vision that i outlined to you . ''
persons come up whom you 're delighted to meet .
`` there 's nothing wrong with that , but just ask yourself , `` '' is this a journey i want to take ? ''
`` does this take me to a place i want to spend time ? '' '' and if you start doing that , you will find that your life changes . ''
invest in the process , not in the outcome .
steve would later tell me that , for all the times he had seen me psychotic , nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day .
my face looked and felt like a mask .
i had closed all the curtains in the apartment , so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness .
time is . time has come . ' 'white is leaving , ' steve said somberly .
delusions are fixed and false beliefs that are n't responsive to evidence , and hallucinations are false sensory experiences .
pat used to say that . have you killed you anyone ? ' rebel and val looked at me as if they or i had been splashed in the face with cold water .
it 's a flat surface . it 's safe . ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me .
back inside , i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was .
`` i do n't believe in joints , but they do hold your body together . ' '' '' — it 's an example of loose associations . — `` '' eventually i made my way back to my dorm room , and once there , i could n't settle down . ''
`` continuing with the writings : `` '' the next morning i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment , and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before , and he eventually brought me to the emergency room . ''
they 're different from me and you .
hundreds of thousands with thoughts , interdiction . ' 'elyn , do you feel like you 're dangerous to yourself or others ?
`` one must stay away . i 'm god , or i used to be . ' '' '' at that point in the text , where i said `` '' i 'm god , or i used to be , '' '' my husband made a marginal note . ''
i could no longer deny the truth , and i could not change it .
`` the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . '' '' everything about this illness says i should n't be here , but i am . and i am , i think , for three reasons : first , i 've had excellent treatment . ''
even with all that — excellent treatment , wonderful family and friends , supportive work environment — i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life , and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i did n't feel safe with people knowing .
the better we understand these illnesses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
so would i take the pill ? in an instant .
good morning .
and the irony is that they do n't need to be .
and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well .
it is ourselves we are healing .
dr. v : see , mcdonald 's ' concept is simple .
and then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagnosis , and then prescribes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glasses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree .
so they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery , are counseled , and then there are buses waiting , which will transport them to the base hospital .
( applause ) and this happens several thousand times each year .
we designed a van with a vsat , which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed , and then as the patient is waiting , the report goes back to the patient , it gets printed out , the patient gets it , and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing — i mean , go see a doctor or come back after six months , and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence .
the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ?
so , as they finish the surgery , they just swing the microscope over , the tables are placed so that their distance is just right , and then we need to do this , because , by doing this kind of process , we 're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon .
today , we believe we have about seven percent of the global market , and they 're used in about 120-odd countries .
we looked at cost .
there are many where this paradigm can now play , but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side .
( video ) man : so you 're here for one reason , and that reason is because you need your business competitors , rivals , haters , or whatever the reason is , or who , they are to go down .
well you , my friend , you 've came to the right place .
things got a bit tricky when i tried to expense it at the company .
cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code .
what i 've got here is two systems , an attacker , which i 've made look all matrix-y and scary , and a victim , which you might recognize from home or work .
now normally , these would be on different sides of the planet or of the internet , but i 've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting .
you will have come in contact with some of them .
this would , of course , normally happen in a couple of seconds , really , really quickly , but i 've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring .
now if i place the mouse cursor over it , this is what we call a command prompt , and using this we can navigate around the computer .
it 's a terrible website . it 's got really awful graphics .
an interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo , it embeds gps data about where that photo was taken .
and it 's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really , really insecure .
so i ran a little scan .
tedattendees , hyattlb . where do you think i 'm staying ?
we called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out , which is quite fun .
forty-six percent of you i could link to a business , xyz employee network .
two hundred and thirty-four of you , well , i know where you live .
`` would someone be able to abuse it ? '' '' we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool . ''
in the u.k. , a 60 percent reduction since 2003 , and there are similar statistics all over the world .
get a secure password .
make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online .
but it 's not just what he stood for , it 's what his message was .
that 's walking abraham 's path .
but that did n't happen .
in some certain situations , i feel , as a woman , i have more power .
that problem started when the gaza tunnel was being built .
one of the times in gaza , during the kidnapping of the british journalist alan johnston , i was asked by an american magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in gaza , and i did .
they came , they picked us up in a black van with black windows , they were wearing masks on that day .
and they drove us away , far away in the middle of a field .
they took our cell phones and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field .
there are some more stories i could tell you about my country .
we have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes .
( applause ) during the time of war , the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning , leaving my children .
being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in gaza .
i still remember a little girl , her name is hala .
and the funny thing is they call me mr. rambo in gaza .
and first let me say , i recently joined google 's moonshot group , where i had a division , the display division in google x , and the brain science work i 'm speaking about today is work i did before i joined google and on the side outside of google .
are you still smart or not ?
and if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
so i could n't handle it .
philiosophers like hume and descartes and hobbes saw things similarly .
next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse .
i 'm not for that .
a lot of effort in mri over the years has gone into making really big , really huge magnets , right ?
and on top of that , we can then layer our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need .
and using fmri , we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow , but the hormones and neurotransmitters i 've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity , which is the dream .
could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought ?
what would we be capable of then ?
we have little option but to open this door .
we need to learn how to take this step together .
community tools , like text messaging , that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding , can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .
last year , hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world 's worst diseases : african sleeping sickness , leishmaniasis and chagas disease .
the political aspects of mobile phones ca n't be ignored either , from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government , to the blairwatch project in the uk , keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .
i 've long admired the witness project , and peter gabriel told us more details about it on wednesday , in his profoundly moving presentation .
not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses , it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation .
that 's understandable and important .
in the best worldchanging tradition , it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas , successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility .
you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones .
at the other end of the network , there 'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to , accessible over the web , combining a photo-sharing service , social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system .
you could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with larry brilliant 's instedd project .
we 'd have a far better — far better knowledge of what 's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone .
because this is what tomorrow could look like : bottom-up , technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced .
hp : ( in chinese ) yr : if i may , i would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork . hp : ( in chinese )
yr : needless to say , i would like to apologize to any mandarin speakers in the audience .
as a child , i would hate being made to wear the indian kurta pajama , because i did n't think it was very cool .
put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .
now , water can flow or it can crash .
it offends me .
who here has n't imitated their childhood hero in the playground , or mum or father ?
a few years ago i went to china for a few months , and i could n't speak chinese , and this frustrated me , so i wrote about this and had it translated into chinese , and then i learned this by heart , like music , i guess .
this is my art .
and with that question , i found myself plunged into the world of sanitation — there 's more coming — ( laughter ) — sanitation , toilets and poop , and i have yet to emerge .
and they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the mumbai airport expressway , which is called open defecation , or poo-pooing in the open .
how ? well , that little boy will not have washed his hands .
and that 's her dad .
it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases .
the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the british medical journal , and they were choosing over the pill , anesthesia , and surgery .
twenty-five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation .
and i understand that . who can blame them ?
poop can cook your dinner .
it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
after three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
she got her toilet , and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing .
so this woman , this boy 's mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation , even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation reinventing the toilet , which is great , we 've got matt damon going on bathroom strike , which is great for humanity , very bad for his colon .
they talk about it . they 've sanitized it .
and do n't think that it 's just in the poor world that things are wrong .
this is what he had to say .
`` `` '' these talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country . ''
as lord blackstone described it , land is protected by trespass law , for most of the history of trespass law , by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .
now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country ?
the supreme court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world , otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits .
common sense , a rare idea in the law , but here it was . common sense — ( laughter ) — revolts at the idea . common sense .
they had an exclusive license on the most popular content , and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge .
in my view , the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that sousa romanticized .
`` ( applause ) and it 's important to emphasize that what this is not is not what we call , quote , `` '' piracy . '' '' i 'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people 's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner . ''
it is a literacy for this generation . this is how our kids speak .
instead , the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies , as they interact , have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal .
because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies , then in the digital world the one fact we ca n't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy .
every single use therefore requires permission ; without permission , you are a trespasser .
so , we need something different , we need a different kind of solution .
because , as bmi demonstrated , competition here can achieve some form of balance . the same thing can happen now .
it 's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it 's always still plastic .
and the bigger picture is : we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .
i was n't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean — of which i have learned there are now 11 gyres , potentially , of plastic in five major oceans in the world .
all of my beverages are packaged in plastic , even at the health food market .
one is : if 80 to 90 percent of what we 're finding in the ocean — of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean — is plastic , then why do n't we call it what it is .
you put something in a bin and you do n't have to think about it again .
whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
now , the next thing we looked into was robots , automation , technology .
( laughter ) that was 1998 .
sixteen years later , you 'd probably say the opposite .
in 1980 , no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist .
for me , a surprisingly high number .
if you split this number up by country , yes , the world is mobile , but only partly .
now , you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what 's the right approach .
`` and i would try to reason with them and say , `` '' why do n't we try something else ? ''
they told me that they had the right model of the patient — that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain — and they also told me that the word patient does n't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
( laughter ) i kept on doing this for a while . ( laughter )
and then , like all good academic projects , i got more funding .
so , my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene , exploded all of a sudden , and i started thinking about what is happening here .
so , like we usually do , i decided to do a simple experiment .
if you were in the experiment , i would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve , but i would n't give you enough time .
you say , what 's the probability of being caught ?
and you weigh these options out — you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
initially we said , what can we do to shrink the fudge factor ?
how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
our subjects doubled their cheating .
i 'll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute .
we got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we prepaid them .
when we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
and at pittsburgh there are two big universities , carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh .
you call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
one was that my favorite nurse , ettie , told me that i did not take her pain into consideration .
zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use , by the hour and by the day , instead of owning their own cars .
now , a decade later , it 's really time to push the envelope a little bit , and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child , and we launched buzzcar a year ago .
some people call this peer-to-peer .
that 's peer-to-peer .
but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet , and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation , and the peers are now in partnership with the company , creating shared value on shared values , and each strengthening the other , and doing what the other ca n't do .
when i talked to their ceo , he had this great line .
so let me take you back how it 's so incredibly different building buzzcar than it was building zipcar , because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about : the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them .
every single decision , i have to think about what is right for both sides .
hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative , they 'd never thought of it before .
way too much money , i just ca n't even go there , with lawyers , trying to figure out how this is different , who 's responsible to whom , and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history .
`` you can earn 60 euros . is n't that great ? yes or no ? '' '' no reply . like , a huge proportion of them could n't be bothered after they had just started , they just signed up , to reply . ''
this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company .
what happens in peer , inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model , and so out of all that influence and that effort , you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out .
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
almost two years ago , i was driving in my car in germany , and i turned on the radio .
but guess what 's really crazy : the way these rating agencies are run .
well , then the country has less available for other services , like roads , schools , healthcare .
the second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day .
i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trimming at the margins .
and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector .
incra would also be based on a very , very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest , and it would include many stakeholders from society .
and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators .
well , our friends at moody 's , standard & poor 's , and fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well .
but guess what ? we do not know exactly how they will take this into account .
because for way too long , we have left the big financial players on their own .
over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
if we look at biology , and many of you probably do n't know , i was a biology major before i went into architecture , the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body , and it 's a fantastic thing .
so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system , and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated , and currently have this installation at the materials & applications gallery in silver lake , close by , and it 's there until august , if you want to see it .
keep in mind , with the digital technology that we have today , this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all . every single one is different .
so this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture , and in this case , here you see a house , that 's for a developer in china , and it 's actually a four-story glass box .
this last project is also of components .
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
and what will happen in the future ?
all the projections [ say that ] this one [ billion ] will [ only ] grow with one to two or three percent .
and these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
because we already have this [ growth ] in process .
here i have on the screen my country bubbles .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
and will it happen ?
but it 's a very important role .
( applause )
whether it 's training for a marathon , picking up an old hobby , or learning a new skill , for most people , self-transformation projects occupy a very positive emotional space .
first of all , let 's acknowledge that change is hard .
first of all , leaders often wait too long to act .
take lego .
rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .
because of these investments , rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation , chronos employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles .
my fourth imperative therefore is to instill a culture of continuous learning .
and right now , our basketball team is the best in the league .
they had n't won a national championship since 1975 .
kerr came in , and he had a clear vision , and he immediately got to work .
and it is widely viewed that that move was the pivotal move in their victory .
`` in the era of `` '' always-on '' '' transformation , organizations are always going to be transforming . ''
but doing so does not have to be exhausting .
( applause )
jh : now is this electromagnetic here , or are these static ?
i mean , you do n't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin , even though the forces can be calculated .
ts : yeah , well let 's put a couple of canvases .
ts : i 'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front .
( laughter ) jh : whoa . that is ...
ooh , nice .
you 've got gravity , you 've got the centrifugal force , you 've got the fluid dynamics .
each of these beautiful paintings , are they images in and of themselves , or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas ?
what it 's also about , just the little events , the events of the interpenetration of — jh : two stars , or — ts : two things that happened — there 's an interference pattern , and then a third thing happens .
there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening , and i 'm very interested in that .
if i throw a very concentric circle , or concentric ellipse , it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines , which get closer and closer together , which describes how gravity works .
and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
my focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology .
and then there are all these forms that we do n't know what they are , but they 're equally well-resolved and complex .
i mean , i 've got the symptoms .
all my creations really start on small drawings , which i have thousands of , and it 's my way of just thinking .
jh : so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces .
but before i do that , i want to tell you a bit about where it came from , what motivated it .
`` in fact , you can see that on the back of the pilot 's shirt , it says , `` no questions until landing '' in russian and in english , because people are curious , and they 'll go tap you , and then you lose your focus and things happen . ''
so in the protests , maybe you noticed , they flew over the river so it was quite safe .
so we already have cameras .
you hear about people with google glass being attacked .
i 've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism .
and i did n't know where he was going with it at first .
`` and he says , `` '' i want to spend the rest of my life with you . '' '' so i wear this whenever i have to do something that makes me a little nervous , like , i do n't know , a tedx talk . ''
and sometimes i just wear it just because .
it 's very , very frustrating , and i was feeling left out , like i was n't quite gay enough .
these gays , people like me , want to be treated like full citizens and it 's all written down in plain sight .
but there it is . the gay agenda .
nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
and we 're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated , that we 've already agreed upon .
and they should be treated with love and respect .
they 're essentially digital cameras .
this is a picture about a year ago .
so as of today , it 's finished . i 'd like to say that i planned that for ted , but i did n't . so it 's been completed as of today .
absolutely everything .
just 12 particles of matter , stuck together by four forces of nature .
( laughter ) but what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything — other than gravity — that happens in the universe .
can anyone see what it is ?
right , h .
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
they 're interacting with the higgs field .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
the story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
the universe was about 75 percent hydrogen , 25 percent helium . it still is today .
it continued to expand about 300 million years .
the second guy — we 'll call him bill — is transfixed by embarrassment , at staring at the thing there in the center .
and in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality .
( laughter ) this trait also tells us a lot about politics .
`` the main researcher of this trait , robert mccrae says that , `` '' open individuals have an affinity for liberal , progressive , left-wing political views '' '' — they like a society which is open and changing — `` whereas closed individuals prefer conservative , traditional , right-wing views . '' ''
this is from some guy named ted .
one , two , three , four , five — about eight or 10 .
because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking .
i was going to ask you which one you picked , but no need .
the best definition of innateness i 've ever seen — this just clarifies so many things for me — is from the brain scientist gary marcus .
the third foundation is in-group/loyalty .
you do find groups in the animal kingdom — you do find cooperative groups — but these groups are always either very small or they 're all siblings .
this probably comes from our long history of tribal living , of tribal psychology .
and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we do n't have tribes , we go ahead and make them , because it 's fun .
i believe these are the five best candidates for what 's written on the first draft of the moral mind .
and my colleagues , brian nosek and jesse graham , and i , made a questionnaire , which we put up on the web at www.yourmorals.org .
but to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination .
in the first panel , we see the moment of creation .
we get every person doing whatever he wants , with every aperture of every other person and every other animal .
but lest you think this is just some part of the christian imagination where christians have this weird problem with pleasure , here 's the same story , the same progression , told in a paper that was published in nature a few years ago , in which ernst fehr and simon gachter had people play a commons dilemma .
a game in which you give people money , and then , on each round of the game , they can put money into a common pot , and then the experimenter doubles what 's in there , and then it 's all divided among the players .
there 's even some recent research suggesting that religion — priming god , making people think about god — often , in some situations , leads to more cooperative , more pro-social behavior .
this is what 's really complicated , that there were people living in places like the grand canyon , cooperating with each other , or on the savannahs of africa , or on the frozen shores of alaska , and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of babylon , and rome , and tenochtitlan .
the answer , i think , is that they used every tool in the toolbox .
and now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives .
they want change and justice , even at the risk of chaos .
`` this guy 's shirt says , `` '' stop bitching , start a revolution . '' '' if you 're high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it 's change , it 's fun . ''
you have the markings of vishnu on the left , so we could think of vishnu as the conservative god .
am i telling you to embrace seng-ts'an and stop , stop with this struggle of for and against ?
and if you want to change other people , a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are — understand our moral psychology , understand that we all think we 're right — and then step out , even if it 's just for a moment , step out — check in with seng-ts'an .
step out .
but there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
but after clay , we shifted that focus , and suddenly , now moving forward , we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response .
now i want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home .
you give him a chainsaw . you send him to joplin , missouri after a tornado , he regains that .
now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , i think , been forgotten or lost or something , and that is , namely , that the os is the interface .
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
so it was a necessity .
one thing you might get is something like the luminous room .
the contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
it projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? and so forth .
and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r & d effort .
and you can come back out through the scary orangutan .
we can fly around them .
now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
maybe select a little bit of that .
and bring out this graph .
so collaborative work , whether it 's immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important .
we can zip through them as a possibility .
( laughter ) yeah , let 's take that one . ( laughter )
the gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
at the moment , our early-adopter customers — and these systems are deployed out in the real world — do all the big data intensive , data heavy problems with it .
ju : it 's been a great pleasure .
after 10 years of experiments , i found it .
would you like to see it ? i brought some with me .
( laughter ) it 's called oxytocin .
i did what most of us do — i tried it on some colleagues .
but i 'm also a skeptic .
make a decision and give me some blood .
but why ?
well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned .
so to make the experiment , i knew i 'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly .
and i found i could do it with a nasal inhaler .
so oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
so to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 .
opens it up and there 's a pearl necklace inside .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and i was the pigeon .
the victim 's brain releases oxytocin , and you 're opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money .
we call them bastards .
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
so you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?
weddings cause a release of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
then the groom 's father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends — arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun .
why ? because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
i mean , astounding ; no one has this .
there you go . that 's connection .
at the age of 41 , i was hit on by a 27-year-old guy .
i know , right ?
you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
instead , this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution .
what that meant for me personally was that overnight i went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide .
now , i admit i made mistakes , especially wearing that beret .
i was branded as a tramp , tart , slut , whore , bimbo , and , of course , that woman .
and let me tell you , corn is in everything .
they do this because they 've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again .
now a while back , i wanted to be an nfl football player .
and that way i can have a greater impact on the world .
i want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices , by buying our food directly from local farmers , or our neighbors who we know in real life .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
not too long ago , my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .
why ? why have we made so little progress ?
we have misinterpreted our perceptions before .
when you simply open your eyes and look about this room , billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged .
what are these neurons up to ?
there are many more examples , but these are just two that you construct what you see .
we are the offspring of those who saw more accurately , and so we can be confident that , in the normal case , our perceptions are accurate .
`` one textbook says , for example , `` '' evolutionarily speaking , vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate . '' '' so the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions . ''
well , let 's first look at a couple of examples in nature .
the australian jewel beetle is dimpled , glossy and brown .
the male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer .
evolution had given them a hack .
a female is anything dimpled , glossy and brown , the bigger the better .
mammals do n't rely on tricks .
well , i wo n't dwell on this , but you get the idea . ( laughter ) so this raises an important technical question : does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is ?
we can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive , which sensory systems are more fit .
so the bottom line is , evolution does not favor veridical , or accurate perceptions .
that is a bit counterintuitive .
in fact , it 's there to hide that reality .
that 's a logical error .
finally , you might object , look , we all see the train , therefore none of us constructs the train .
but remember this example .
we all see a train because we each see the train that we construct , and the same is true of all physical objects .
space as you perceive it is your desktop .
why ? because we 're blind to our own blindnesses .
dh : yes . now that 's a very , very good point .
that is a light curve .
i completely lost my sight because of extended illness , and with it , i lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics .
now i 'm going to play the burst for you .
you may remember that i said that the matter around the star is dragged around ?
and this is happening right now .
hello , doha . hello !
hello , habibi . just do n't move . just stay there , please .
there 's so much , we laugh , right ?
it is a single-celled organism , a cell , that joins together with other cells to form a mass super-cell to maximize its resources .
so i took it home and i watched .
i was quite impressed by this feat , at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory , know itself , and move with seeming intention .
as it goes , each food node it finds , it forms a network , a connection to , and keeps foraging .
so where does that intelligence lie ?
so this is a microscopy , a video i shot , and it 's about 100 times magnification , sped up about 20 times , and inside the slime mold , there is a rhythmic pulsing flow , a vein-like structure carrying cellular material , nutrients and chemical information through the cell , streaming first in one direction and then back in another .
and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
but what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence , agency , autonomy , and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that ensued .
people talked about the human psychology , of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos .
we did n't just give them oats .
it 's biologically fascinating , it 's computationally interesting , but it 's also a symbol , a way of engaging with ideas of community , collective behavior , cooperation .
their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism .
they not only recorded history — they helped change the course of history .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice .
with it , we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun does n't shine .
we 're going to do it the old-fashioned american way , we 're going to invent our way out , working together .
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that do n't cost us a fortune .
in fact , i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity , but instead consumes electricity , huge amounts of it .
i recall the very moment one day when i was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance , different , opposite density and high mutual reactivity .
the electrons go to work in the real world out here , powering our devices .
and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature .
that 's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 american households .
maybe elizabeth , this great icon , dancing ?
and how many of you did not get that ?
`` so i come up , and i say , `` '' what am i going to do today ? '' '' i 'm not going to do what i planned to do , and i put myself into absolute panic . ''
i 'm doing it right now ; you can watch me . i 'm getting nervous , i do n't know what to say , i do n't know what i 'm doing , i do n't want to go there .
`` and the studio executives , they would say , `` hey , look at shekhar . he 's so prepared . '' ''
and you put yourself into a state of panic where you do n't know , and so you do n't know .
[ unclear ] , you said that yesterday . i 'm just repeating it because that 's what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere , the emptiness .
so that 's what i do .
in delhi , we used to live — we used to call it a chhat or the khota .
and i would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity .
and then when i would run out of that story , i would imagine that woodcutter 's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter .
`` of course , when i asked cate blanchett , i said , `` '' what 's the film about ? '' '' she said , `` '' the film 's about a woman coming to terms with growing older . '' '' psychological . ''
bess throckmorton ? bess : here , my lady . elizabeth : tell me , is it true ? are you with child ?
bess : yes , my lady . elizabeth : traitorous . you dare to keep secrets from me ? you ask my permission before you rut ,
do you hear me ? do you hear me ?
elizabeth : this is no time for mercy , walsingham .
is it his ?
go .
that 's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality , come in , release her spirit .
`` that struck a chord , and i said , `` '' that 's true . '' '' i went to see a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor , which is a really , really upmarket area in mumbai . ''
you understand flyovers ? yeah ?
and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities , about 10 to 12 percent of the people have moved to the upper city .
so the design has a story .
so , okay my time is up .
everything 's a contradiction .
in a storyteller 's mind , it 's a contradiction of moralities .
harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment .
thank you very much .
( applause )
they 're absolutely everywhere .
the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california .
so as you 'll guess , this is a hospital .
i 've marked for you on the left the oncology department .
the patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right .
`` the patients even called it `` '' the chemo trail . '' '' now , when the hospital saw this originally , they tried to lay turf back over it , ignore it . ''
( applause )
however , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
so i combined these two ideas and i formulated a hypothesis , saying that , could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in ph ?
the first stage was completed at home , which consisted of marinating the chicken , grilling the chicken , amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab .
the saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well , decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent .
would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life ?
( applause ) shree bose : hi everyone . i 'm shree bose .
and that was my first science fair project .
my older brother panaki bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when i barely understood basic algebra .
got rejected by all except one .
but yet , it 's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states .
and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase , an energy protein .
so we ran all of these tests blocking the protein , and we saw this huge shift .
it was about finding my passion .
that 's why being the grand prize winner of the google global science fair — cute picture , right — it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor .
thank you .
people spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors .
and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined .
at first , i just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients .
and it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health , because that relationship seems so important .
because i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation , we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively .
so that peak expiratory flow rate , i 've entered it up into the interactive software model .
`` so any user can come in here and click on `` '' lung function report '' '' and it 'll take them to this report that i created . ''
this is the measurement that she took in her doctor 's office .
because what i feel , is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level , that we ca n't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything .
and air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients , anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general .
`` but for me , what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something i call the `` '' i can '' '' bug . ''
`` so , when ragav experienced that he went from `` '' teacher told me , '' '' to `` '' i am doing it . '' '' and that 's the `` '' i can '' '' mindshift . ''
`` here was a city telling its child , `` '' you can . '' '' a glimpse of infection in ahmedabad . ''
we have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .
so , you 're getting the pattern . first 200 children at riverside .
then 30,000 children in ahmedabad , and growing .
`` so , on august 15th , again , independence day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , `` '' i can . '' '' how ? we designed a simple toolkit , converted it into eight languages , and reached 32,000 schools . ''
and they did . stories of change poured in from all over india , from nagaland in the east , to jhunjhunu in the west , from sikkim in the north , to krishnagiri in the south .
woman : i am so happy that my students did this campaign .
kbs : an inner city school in hyderabad .
are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? audience : yes !
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes ! girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
`` last i heard , the preamble still said , `` '' we , the people of india , '' '' right ? ''
me was a floating head .
if i was afraid , i went to more dangerous places .
i was a vegetarian , i was sober , i did n't smoke .
i heard thousands of stories , and i have to tell you , there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body — when she left home .
i went to the democratic republic of congo .
it arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane .
and gratefully , it did n't .
`` and my friend was preparing this big bowl , and i said , `` '' what is it ? '' '' and she said , `` '' it 's for you . ''
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was the sorrow that 's taken so long .
it was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands .
it was magic healers and aromatic oils .
it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for , because i know this struggle is n't my own .
today i 'm going to talk about work .
for folks in this room , the work we do is challenging , it 's engaging , it 's stimulating , it 's meaningful .
i 'm not talking about the technology of things , profound though that is .
( laughter ) in addition to creating things , science creates ideas .
whether he intended it or not , what adam smith was telling us there , is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted .
thank you .
after world war ii , europe was devastated , but still held large overseas colonies : french west africa , british east africa , south asia , and so forth .
over 50 new countries were born .
we can start with mongolia , or as some call it , mine-golia .
that 's larger than the entire population of russia .
this is the map of the yuan dynasty , led by kublai khan , the grandson of genghis khan .
so history does n't necessarily repeat itself , but it does rhyme .
it starts with the global hubs .
tokyo , seoul , beijing , shanghai , hong kong , singapore and sidney .
australia , for example , is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to china .
chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result .
what lines on the map should we focus on ?
what i want to present to you is what i call state building , day by day .
is it really a border on the map ?
now remember kurdistan is landlocked .
and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .
30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict .
the last time that was the case was actually a century ago , during the ottoman empire .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists .
but now it 's contributing gas across the caspian sea to provide for europe , and even a potentially turkmen- afghan-pakistan-india pipeline as well .
then there is kazakhstan , which did n't even have a name before .
it was more considered south siberia during the soviet union .
what does that tell us ? trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is .
i do n't think it does . i think it 's already part of a euro-turkish superpower .
let 's not neglect the insurgency just to the south , balochistan . two weeks ago , balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison , and this was the flag that they raised over it .
53 countries , and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map .
and like our relationship with the ecosystem we 're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet .
now we fear changes on the map .
then we 'll wind up with the world we want , a borderless one .
these images show the onset of the rains this season in kenya .
after that , you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves , whereas at flowering , you need it to rain more frequently , about once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob .
at the end of the season , you actually do n't want it to rain , because rains then can damage the crop .
they could n't take on this kind of risk .
these organizations became our customers , and when combining credit and insurance , interesting things can happen .
we 've got you .
`` we 'll give you 200,000 euros at the end of the season . '' '' they said , `` '' wow , that 's great , but that 'll be late . ''
`` then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season . '' '' so we convinced our insurance partners , and later that april , these farmers replanted . ''
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison .
or — think about it — that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
it 's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
now judy bonds is a coal miner 's daughter .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it 's a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
now judy and i — i have to say — totally related to each other .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
they 're not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive — and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
fortunately — because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs — but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
`` and so we know `` '' urban ag '' '' is a big buzz topic this time of the year , but it 's mostly gardening , which has some value in community building — lots of it — but it 's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production . ''
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
so i 'm hoping you can see a little theme here .
i have n't created it , and it 's not happening by accident .
it is an essential pillar to this country 's recovery .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
and i 'm a grown woman now , and i have learned a few things along the way .
( laughter ) but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain .
i 'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being , its way of working , its way of feeling .
the white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being , brought to the same intensity .
it seems to be magic .
a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .
`` and turning around you is `` '' shhhhhhh , '' '' like that . ''
and the irony for me was of course , i did n't do that for the sake of science progress .
so even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry , target of stability , the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable .
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
and here you can get the white core .
this is , the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him .
and he does not feel anymore it 's relies on asthma treatment , as the asthma treatment needs him .
because it is a kind of object with a conscience , able to be modified by its surroundings , and able to modify it as well .
in coal mines , this canary was supposed to be close to the miners .
`` a very natural technology , in order to say to the miners , `` the air is too bad . you have to go . it 's an emergency . '' ''
and this is exactly the same at home .
so this is the final object .
indeed , this object is a domestic farm , for fishes and green .
because you can grow some potatoes .
now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight .
so i designed , for an american scientist based in paris , a very stimulative , brain-stimulative office .
it really helped me to design it .
the children managed to run back onto the tracks .
no one was lost there . but the water continued to climb .
a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog , who was apparently afraid .
voice 1 : yeah . it 's coming again .
and so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment , a moment in which the blogosphere came , to a certain degree , of age .
because when we think about blogs , i think for most of us who are concerned about them , we 're primarily concerned with things like politics , technology , etc .
and i want to ask three questions in this talk , in the 10 minutes that remain , about the blogosphere .
ok , the first question : what do they tell us about why people do things ?
they are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and , to some extent , the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job .
and they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them .
in a sense , the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future , in probabilistic terms .
but there 's also a downside to this — a kind of dark side , in fact — and that is that the more tightly linked we 've become to each other , the harder it is for each of us to remain independent .
that 's one of the things that defines what a network is .
when we talk about bottom-up , decentralized phenomena , the ant colony is the classic metaphor , because , no individual ant knows what it 's doing , but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .
you saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they had n't before .
okay , i 've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
it has to be brought down because we 're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day .
i won the world yoyo contest again in the artistic performance division .
today , they number in the hundreds , and they 're endangered .
whales in our waters are still low in numbers , however , because they do face a range of other human-induced threats .
but what 's really cool is that they 're also really important after they 're dead .
let 's also do it for ours .
so let 's pull up , now , something else .
it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
i brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather 's favorite authors .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
just stop it .
and since then i 've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights .
in the last six months , more than 300 skyscrapers in the uae have been put on hold or canceled .
they pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
one of the big things about countering terrorism is , how do you perceive it ?
we 've got to attack that brand in front of them .
we 've got to show we 're a better product .
you know , there 's nothing heroic about killing a young kid .
our target audience , it 's not just the producers of terrorism , as i 've said , the terrorists .
it 's not just the marketeers of terrorism , which is those who finance , those who facilitate it , but it 's the consumers of terrorism .
we 've got to get in to those homelands .
that 's where they recruit from . that 's where they get their power and strength .
now , staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds , think about delivery mechanisms .
we 've got to practice what we preach .
and that is a hard thing for the head to take .
she had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities . she 's going to give up university to look after mum .
but of course , it 's ideas — is not something that governments do very well .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities , the greatest spaces that we have had .
but i think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings , to live in cities , to connect ourselves in a social space .
think of the empire state building , the rockefeller center .
even the mind is emotional .
it 's not only the forms of cities , but the fact that they incarnate emotions , not just of those who build them , but of those who live there as well .
i think that 's part of what the complexity of architecture is .
and i think we should n't shy away in architecture , you know , brain surgery , atomic theory , genetics , economics are complex complex fields .
and yet , our lives are complex .
our emotions are complex .
but the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart , the human soul .
it 's a self-induced poison .
a space that does n't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us , but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities , other experiences , that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture .
and of course buildings have their shapes .
we would not know which way we were going , and why we are going where we 're going .
without the memory there would be no story to tell .
and that indeed is the architectural mission that i believe is important , is to create spaces that are vibrant , that are pluralistic , that can transform the most prosaic activities , and raise them to a completely different expectation .
and of course risk . i think architecture should be risky .
you know it costs a lot of money and so on , but yes , it should not play it safe .
risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws , into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready-made thing .
it 's about carving out a space for trees .
and that is where i end .
i came from the bronx . i was taught not to be a loser , not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight .
well i , like a lot of us , spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change , and i do n't think we should fuss about it .
if you want to sell more products , if you want to get more investment , if you want to become more competitive , then you need to start behaving , because that 's why people will respect you and do business with you , and therefore , the more you collaborate , the more competitive you become .
bizarrely , nobody had ever thought of measuring this before .
i do not mean morally good .
best is something different .
there 's germany at 13th , the u.s. comes 21st , mexico comes 66th , and then we have some of the big developing countries , like russia at 95th , china at 107th .
chris anderson : this is such a strange thing .
( laughter ) ( applause ) linus torvalds : it really does n't look like much .
you can kind of see , on the walls are this light green .
when a photographer shows up , i dress up , so i have clothes on .
so it was about the end of the journey , which , 25 years later , we still have not reached .
i made it publicly available , and it was n't even open source at that point .
the big point for me was not being alone and having 10 , maybe 100 people being involved — that was a big point .
lt : so one of the issues we had , and this took a while to start to appear , is when you ...
there 's a lot of people who make small , small changes .
and there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance .
and this is literally how i work .
i do n't code for — well , i do code for fun — but i want to code for something meaningful so every single project i 've ever done has been something i needed and — ca : so really , both linux and git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people .
you 've given us some clues , but ...
that 's my younger brother .
i was clearly more interested in the rubik 's cube than my younger brother .
i lived in silicon valley for seven years .
that 's not how silicon valley works .
ca : but during the actual development of linux itself , that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people .
lt : i do n't know if it 's essential .
and i 'm not proud of that .
good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what 's the right way to do things .
because if you actually compare the two , tesla has kind of this mind grab these days , but who actually changed the world ?
so there 's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man and thinking i did the right choices .
and we have arguments despite this , right ?
ca : but you 're not a visionary , and so it 's not up to you to name them .
( laughter ) it 's up to you guys to make them , right ?
( applause )
and other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells .
your heart gets more blood flow .
now we 're also about to publish a study — the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
this is what 's called a heat map — and the different colors — and along the side , on the right , are different genes .
we are on an amazing journey the next four days .
and this is not a rhetorical question .
i actually want answers from you .
a part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent , to separate the rhetoric from the reality , the fact from the fiction .
so let 's get going because africa , to some degree , is on a turnaround .
and there we worked with leading ceos on african issues , and african companies on turnarounds , making the companies not just the best in africa but the best globally .
but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle .
and legend has it that alexander trekked through this desert .
half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm .
and it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because i 'll never forget it . i remember the very moment .
and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point .
and let 's start at the high level , on the macro-factors .
inflation , in general , is coming down across africa — that 's the first sign — in many countries reaching double-digit figures .
it 's meaningless .
other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr , the big boys of private equity .
it 's an investment opportunity . think about that .
i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
bellwether signs again .
but with africa , let 's start being careful about this .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation , from over 80 banks to 25 banks . strengthening of the system .
it 's more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inflation is affected .
`` if i had to ask you , `` '' in 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ? '' '' would egypt come to mind ? ''
these are the trends that are taking place .
because in africa today , we are competing globally for capital .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
if one looks carefully , on the congo river is one of those bright lights . and that 's the very congo river generating light — the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power .
( applause )
why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
so why are we having so many problems with these social problems , and really is there any role for business , and if so , what is that role ?
business is not seen as the solution .
so this perspective is perhaps justified .
well , we 've tended to see the solutions in terms of ngos , in terms of government , in terms of philanthropy .
but i think at this moment , we 've been at this for quite a while .
what 's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems ?
we ca n't make a large-scale impact on these problems .
there 's not enough tax revenue , there 's not enough philanthropic donations , to deal with these problems the way we 're dealing with them now .
and the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
other institutions can utilize them to do important work , but only business can create them .
how do we tap into this ?
now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
but again , this path that we 've been on is not getting us where we need to go .
now , i started out as a strategy professor , and i 'm still a strategy professor .
the deeper we get into these issues , the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems .
in the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there 's fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we 're learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
this is an example of jain irrigation .
there 's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .
and the question is , how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value ?
if we can break down this sort of divide , this unease , this tension , this sense that we 're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
thank you .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
and this is my postcard collection today .
`` `` '' everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes i 'm dead . '' '' `` `` i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i did n't wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . '' '' ( laughter ) this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you . ''
and it had n't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending .
matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they 've found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
and i 'd commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came .
on the weekend , your choice .
it 's structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it 's okay to break it here and there .
after all , cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake .
the program has been great , weekday veg .
thank you .
and a lot of people ask me , you know , what kind of people do you get for a project like this ?
( laughter ) along that same line , i have to tell you that with the spate of hollywood movies that came out last year , we have never seen monsters underground — at least the kind that eat you .
this is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet .
`` for those who have never seen this story , jim cameron produced a really wonderful imax movie couple of years ago , called `` '' aliens of the deep . '' '' there was a brief clip — ( video ) narrator : a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge . ''
europa is so far away that even at the speed of light , it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle .
it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice .
you need a melt probe .
if we see something that looks interesting , we pull it into a microscope .
something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime .
what i 'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
it 's not going to look like that .
now , to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement , i 've got to give you the basics of space 101 .
in fact , you can get it better — you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon .
if we 're going to get that , and make that gas station possible , we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .
we ca n't do that right now .
we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .
you got two choices .
you can burn rocket fuel to get there , or you can do something really incredible .
the orbital refueling stations i 've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration .
100 years after sir ernest shackleton wrote these words , i intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier , in our time , for all of us .
frank gehry : i listened to this scientist this morning .
fg : people on the street came and knocked on the door to see if i was okay .
rsw : ... huh . ( laughter ) i 'd like to start this session again .
fg : well , i 've always just ...
i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .
i think it was circumstantial .
until i got to my house , where the client was my wife .
but i just found out the world ai n't going to last that long , this guy was telling us the other day .
fg : i do n't really know .
so , i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy .
fg : i knew you 'd ask that question .
i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work , and his early work had a resemblance to my early work .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it was n't ...
`` fg : he calls architecture `` '' plumbing . '' '' ( laughter ) fg : anyway , the siza thing . ''
it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians — it 's similar to that i would imagine — where you ... huh ?
( laughter ) rsw : what 's his schedule on that ?
no , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos , right ?
and i think everybody — i mean that should be a matter of fact , like gravity .
you 're not going to defy gravity .
and then what ?
and i think that 's what i 've always been interested in , is that — which is a personal kind of expression .
( laughter ) rsw : ... people wanted a michael graves building .
and then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga .
it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here , and i was here , and my guys .
( laughter ) rsw : oh , my god .
but let me just say a couple words .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
now i think it 's too easy . i think it 's too easy
now what is atheism 2.0 ?
`` i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , `` '' i ca n't believe in any of this stuff . ''
it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
that 's a lovely idea .
`` they 'd go , `` '' no , no . i do n't need one of those . ''
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they 'll remember it .
we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
now i think that the potential is there , but we 've completely let ourselves down .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
and corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they 're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it .
i want to conclude .
ca : incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment .
ca : but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense — that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious — of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are .
ab : i would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
it 's seen as hypocrisy .
( applause )
and in the absence of that deadline , we would still be dreaming about it .
`` and we had this mantra : `` human . kind . be both . '' ''
`` and instead of going up to someone and asking them , `` '' what do you do ? '' '' ask them , `` '' so what are your dreams ? '' '' or `` '' what are your broken dreams ? '' '' you know , `` '' ted . '' '' tend to each other 's dreams . ''
it 's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously , and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be .
as a particle physicist , i study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level .
it does n't interact at all . so how do we know it 's there ?
if it 's constant , that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see .
they 're the white , fuzzy , elliptical things here .
but these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds .
and the answer is yes .
many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the hubble space telescope .
and it 's an enormous amount of mass .
they are centered on some more spread out structure , and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded , ok .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger , ok .
so the expansion slows down with time .
by how much less is it expanding today , compared to , say , a couple of billion years ago ?
no one was predicting ahead of time this is what 's going to be found .
so we need something to be able to explain that .
do we have anything for dark matter ? and the answer is yes .
kb : i love that shot .
for a filmmaker , new technology is an amazing tool , but the other thing that really , really excites me is when new species are discovered .
but how to reach it ?
( music ) this two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue , the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world .
there are so many wonderful places .
but some locations draw you back time and time again .
but at 15,000 feet , it 's tough .
where deserts freeze and waters boil .
and we learned a few things about how to have a good end .
in their final years , jim and shirley faced cancers , fractures , infections , neurological illness .
`` but one day , you 're going to say , `` '' this thing is going to get me . '' '' jim and shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that . ''
`` a lot of people say , `` '' if i get like that , just shoot me . '' '' this is not a plan either ; this is illegal . ''
( laughter ) a plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want .
you will need advocates .
do n't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child .
in my experience , you 'll want to hear that whatever you 're worried about is going to be fine .
what i 've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life , we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life .
( tapping ) so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens .
and once again , two scientists have got a problem with noise .
arno penzias and robert wilson were using the horn antenna at bell 's holmdel laboratory to study the milky way with extraordinary precision .
so how can we save what we do n't understand ?
although we flew straight over this bridge , we imaged it in 3d , captured its color in just a few seconds .
this is how we see a rainforest , in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another .
the first questions is , how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests ?
basically , we need a high-tech accounting system .
and let me tell you , peru alone is an amazing place , totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today .
and we can go to the biggest swamp in the western amazon .
temperatures are increasing , and what 's really happening is we 're getting a lot of droughts , recurring droughts .
we flew over this same river , imaged the system in 3d .
and third and final question is , how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems ?
ben roche : so i 'm ben , by the way .
br : and we 're chefs . so when moto opened in 2004 , people did n't really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call
so yeah , we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
instead of making foods that look like things that you would n't eat , we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know .
there 's a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and error — i guess , more error — that goes into each and every dish , so we do n't always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
( applause ) br : and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger , which is a cool side effect .
let 's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that .
br : so you see us here cutting up some watermelon . the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate tons of food miles , wasted energy , and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna , or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place , with local , organic produce ; so we have a watermelon from wisconsin .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology ?
i take a piece of paper , i visualize my story , sometimes i sketch , sometimes i do n't .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , such as the 2010 haitian earthquake .
i can not speak for all my images , so i 'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title .
`` `` mad growth on columbus circle . '' ''
`` and at one point , i had to do `` '' the whole nine yards . '' '' so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long . ''
larger images , i started to run marathons .
with public art , i could also make cut glass .
so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose .
i also planted the bibliotree .
so it 's a tree , and in its trunk you have the roots of languages .
and along the way , i 'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques .
people say things about religion all the time .
so there have been these long debates over the centuries , in that case , actually , we can say over the millennia , about religion .
the rabbi says he does n't believe in god .
but this changes in the late 19th century , and for the first time , it 's possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like darwin .
my father did this . every time he opened a bottle of whiskey , which i 'm glad to say was very often , he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground , and he would talk to , he would say to akroma-ampim , the founder of our line , or yao antony , my great uncle , he would talk to them , offer them a little bit of this .
i 'm guessing you 're thinking of a collection of trees , what we foresters call a stand , with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns .
how do i know this ?
i grew up in the forests of british columbia .
so i studied forestry .
so i went back to school , and i studied my other world .
i thought yes .
but this was really controversial , and some people thought i was crazy , and i had a really hard time getting research funding .
( laughter ) so i came back the next day , and mama grizzly and her cub were gone .
i got my giant syringes , and i injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases , first the birch .
i got to the final bag , the 80th replicate , and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again .
then the moment of truth .
i was so excited , i ran from plot to plot and i checked all 80 replicates .
the evidence was clear .
in a single forest , a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees .
so we set about an experiment , and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger 's seedlings .
they even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids .
these are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks .
and third , when we do cut , we need to save the legacies , the mother trees and networks , and the wood , the genes , so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road .
jigs 's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world , and it changed my view of forests .
and i 'm gon na try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the ted commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity .
and i had a miniature poodle .
and then , i also was n't really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it was n't bad , but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words .
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
but , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
but when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you 're finding is what matters . the meaning .
there is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as i understand it . ( laughter ) and this happens constantly in the writing .
there is also a big question of ambiguity .
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
ok. i think if somebody really was drowning , she 'd save them .
maybe things go wrong . and so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
i was thinking that i should n't go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i approved of the military regime there .
in writing a story , it is the place where i begin .
sometimes i get help from the universe , it seems .
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know .
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
and i took down this book , and i — first page that i flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period , and the kind of character i needed — was the taiping rebellion , happening in the area near guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of god .
especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
`` and i asked him , `` '' how is it possible to do this ? '' '' and he said , `` '' well , i guess with everything in life , there 's a place of balance . '' '' and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point . ''
a big thing that i also think about is accidents .
it takes a while , but i have to let go of them and just go there , and be there .
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons .
years go by , of course , and the writing , it does n't happen instantly , as i 'm trying to convey it to you here at ted .
1996 , when i gave my first tedtalk , rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row .
my daughter 's 20. she 's a college student .
but then these same children deny each other their full attention .
when he goes to work , he does n't stop by to talk to anybody , he does n't call .
`` people say , `` '' i 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation . ''
`` over and over i hear , `` i would rather text than talk . '' ''
but that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life .
`` so during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy , i was thinking , `` '' that robot ca n't empathize . ''
it does n't face death .
and that third idea , that we will never have to be alone , is central to changing our psyches .
and so people try to solve it by connecting .
`` the problem with this new regime of `` '' i share therefore i am '' '' is that , if we do n't have connection , we do n't feel like ourselves . ''
we almost do n't feel ourselves .
when we do n't have the capacity for solitude , we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive .
when this happens , we 're not able to appreciate who they are .
but it 's time to talk .
we grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up .
start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
we have each other .
so in my work , i hear that life is hard , relationships are filled with risk .
and i was reminded by karen armstrong 's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
and we have one .
`` this was from nature magazine . these are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called `` '' supergrid '' '' to supply all of the electrical power to europe , largely from developing countries — high-voltage dc currents . ''
and it is based on an old model .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice — just as jill [ bolte ] taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
i wish i could find the words to convey this .
we have the capacity to do it .
`` what a burden we have . '' '' i would like to ask you to reframe that . how many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ? ''
that hurts .
co2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
so that 's why i began by saying , be optimistic in what you do , but be an active citizen .
and that 's hard to — that 's hard to create — but it is coming .
( cheering ) ep : okay , that 's very touching , very emotional , but it was not easy to get there .
so it was not easy at all .
we 've got lots of people , pollution , cars , concrete , lots of concrete .
if you do n't have open spaces , you 've got to go there and open spaces .
it 's going to be a place where people can meet , where you can put nature .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
and it 's something that we 're doing , again , lots in rio .
it 's the brt , the bus rapid transit .
you can build nice stations .
let me just show a map of rio again .
you see the contrast between the rich and poor .
i 'm going to give a fast example here .
this is osorio , he 's our secretary of urban affairs .
so how 's the weather in rio now ?
absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather , today and in the next few days .
let me get you one of our 8,000 buses .
now it 's 11:00 pm in rio .
( applause ) okay , so no files , this place , no paperwork , no distance , 24/7 working .
that is great , that means we 're going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together .
( applause )
i have one more reason for optimism : climate change .
for many different reasons , but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global north and the global south .
i was actually horrified at the consequences of what i had just said , at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live .
well , now we have a shift in the economic equation , and with that , with broader support from everyone , it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest .
but i do believe that we have come over the past six years from the impossible to the now unstoppable .
yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment , graffiti-style — or , more specifically , without permission and unsanctioned .
but when i started this over 10 years ago , i did n't have a word for it , i did n't have any ambitious notions about it , i had no visions of grandeur .
we all live in this fast-paced , digital world , but we still crave and desire something that 's relatable .
it had reached global status .
people from all over the world were doing this .
but if you think about it , what would happen if you put those things down ?
what would you make ? what would you create with your own hands ?
a lot of people think that i am a master knitter but i actually could n't knit a sweater to save my life .
that 's almost 27 feet .
the scale is comparable in height ; in fact , it 's smaller than this telescope will be .
it 's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe — literally , the dawn of the cosmos .
five hundred years ago , copernicus displaced the earth , and put the sun at the heart of the cosmos .
and they 're like light buckets — literally , they collect light .
we 've even found planets that are orbiting two stars .
the mirrors are cast and they 're cooled very slowly , and then they 're polished to an exquisite precision .
that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope .
this is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
extraordinary precision .
stay with me , because i have a question for you .
you mentioned different facilities .
now , i am not one of those people .
well , why is that ?
we do n't even know how many species of insects there are , because new ones are being discovered all the time .
there are at least a million , maybe as many as 10 million .
insects seem like they do everything that people do .
female aphids can make little , tiny clones of themselves without ever mating .
but they also compete after mating with their sperm .
the ancient greeks knew that there was a class of bees , the drones , that are larger than the workers , although they disapproved of the drones ' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight — they 're the males .
and when i tell them that the ferocious army-ant soldiers with their giant jaws , used to defend the colony , are all always female , they seem to not quite believe me .
( laughter ) and certainly all of the movies — antz , bee movie — portray the main character in the social insects as being male .
well , what difference does this make ?
what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld ?
i think it does matter , and it 's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives .
they have complicated behavior , but they lack complicated brains .
i really love that it 's difficult to anthropomorphize insects , to look at them and just think of them like they 're little people in exoskeletons , with six legs .
now , you know , people write fiction and talk about parallel universes .
because this is wrong .
well , if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value , you go to a doctor , they stick a needle in .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
but , if we start to understand that cancer is n't just a molecular defect , it 's something more , then we 'll get to new ways of treating it , as i 'll show you .
that has n't changed in over 150 years .
so , the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
this is n't a genetic disease .
the good news is you can manipulate them .
it 's used to treat osteoporosis , and they got that twice a year .
they looked and , in these 1,800 women , given twice a year a drug that builds bone , you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent .
there 's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes , that if you give this cancer drug , you can do this effect to the cell , but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body .
so , the problem is , yours and mine , all of our systems are changing .
but , if you start to look at it , that red , that dark color there , more than 75 percent of the population of those countries are obese .
look a decade ago , look two decades ago : markedly different .
it was in her brain , in her lungs , in her liver .
so , the problem is that the clinical trial was done , and we were a part of it , and in the fundamental clinical trial — the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three , we refused to use a placebo .
we can start to look at different components along this spectrum .
danny and i got 16 million dollars , they announced yesterday , to try to attach this problem .
and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward , instead of just having encounter and encounter , without fundamental learning .
so , to conclude , we need to get away from reductionist thinking .
you live on a small farm in the philippines .
every one of us can actually test dna ourselves .
that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover , pausing at every line , just to find the nearest pizza joint .
( laughter ) luckily , three decades ago , humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information .
but once they find it , that dna is still tiny , and surrounded by so much other dna , that what these machines then do is copy the target gene , and one copy piles on top of another , millions and millions and millions of copies , until that gene stands out against the rest ; until we can visualize it , interpret it , read it , understand it , until we can answer : does my pig have the flu ?
scientists use it every day to detect and address disease , to create innovative medicines , to modify foods , to assess whether our food is safe to eat or whether it 's contaminated with deadly bacteria .
for example , i could never have imagined that a truffle farmer , of all people , would use personal dna machines .
we see him pictured here , holding the first uk-cultivated truffle in his hands , on one of his farms .
this may seem like an extreme place for dna analysis , but let 's move on to an even more extreme environment : outer space .
the daniels family , for example , set up a dna lab in the basement of their suburban chicago home .
they were testing tomatoes that they had picked , taking the flesh of their skin , putting it in a test tube , mixing it with chemicals to extract dna and then using their home dna copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits .
it is in our dna to be curious .
so this is where people went astray again .
you can tell it 's mature bone .
`` when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about `` '' we '' '' and `` '' them . '' '' and when they come back into the lecture room i ask them , `` '' what do you mean with `` '' we '' '' and `` '' them '' '' ? ''
`` and what is the definition then ? `` `` the definition ? ''
and really this is about the bedroom .
so the problem i had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born .
look here when i move them forward .
it 's on par with united states in these two social dimensions .
but if i would change this axis here , i would instead put income per person .
you can watch me for one minute now and you 'll see the whole thing .
mexico is not at all on par with the united states , but they are quite close .
and my youngest son , who studied chinese in beijing .
but in china they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period , for 100 years , when they went backwards .
mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china , and then he died , and then deng xiaoping started this amazing move forward .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
well , one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution .
and on this axis , gdp .
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
it 's lincoln here , advancing them .
and that does n't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor .
and the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .
it 's the most tropical country in the world , a marshland on the equator .
they got a magnificent health system that beat both the u.s. and sweden .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
there is no such thing as an hiv epidemic in africa .
they have a very high level . it 's coming down .
because here , in congo , there is war .
and here , in zambia , there is peace .
make it a local issue . and do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
that has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
do n't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .
and we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world .
it is a struggle within , a struggle against vice , sin , temptation , lust , greed .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the koran .
but there have always been , in islam , a small group , a minority , who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith , or the faithul .
and some of these people believe that in that struggle , it is sometimes okay to take up arms .
and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country , in their minds they were fighting a jihad , they were doing jihad , and they named themselves the mujahideen , which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad .
`` they had never paid him any attention before — old man , small mosque — but now they began to pay visits , and sometimes they would drag him in for questions , and always the same question : `` '' why did you name your granddaughter jihad ? ''
he told me that , of bin laden 's many crimes , this was , in his mind , one that did n't get enough attention , that he took this word , this beautiful idea .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
does it mean we can break out the champagne , wash our hands of it , disengage , sleep easy at night ?
do we know , do we understand , who killed bin ladenism ?
who killed bin ladenism ? the arab spring did , because it showed a way for young muslims to bring about change in a manner that osama bin laden , with his limited imagination , could never have conceived .
so all these factors , and many more besides , we do n't even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin ladenism , the global jihad , you needed this group effort .
we 're talking about a pick , pack and ship setting here .
i worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called webvan .
imagine , we had an 89¢ can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote .
of course webvan went out of business , and about a year and a half later , i was still noodling on this problem . it was still nagging at me .
and i said , let me just focus briefly on what i wanted as a pick worker , or my vision for how it should work .
this is what i need . what technology is available to solve this problem ?
take a blank sheet , of course , but then test your ideas at the limits — infinity , zero .
but when i need diet coke and i call it , you guys talk amongst yourselves .
we 'll use mobile robots and we 'll move the inventory around .
and so we got underway on that and then i 'm sitting on my couch in 2008 .
did any of you see the beijing olympics , the opening ceremonies ?
you stand up , i 'll squat down .
we send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods .
they actually complete the whole order .
we are but the base of chaos .
nonetheless , in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago , i decided i would try and do that .
and i sort of get it .
so there you are .
and what do you know , nobody else does talk to the hackers .
and he did a great job in it .
then we have renukanth subramaniam , aka jilsi — founder of darkmarket , born in colombo , sri lanka .
at 11 , he was interrogated by the sri lankan military , accused of being a terrorist , and his parents sent him on his own to britain as a refugee seeking political asylum .
he was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud , and he will be released from wormwood scrubs jail in london in 2012 .
and he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed , also for the authorities here , that gary mckinnon — who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon — suffers from asperger 's and a secondary condition of depression .
i landed for the first time in rome , italy .
i was n't there to sightsee .
i was crushed .
when i look back now on that first summer in rome and i see how much has changed over the past six years , it is an absolute transformation .
you have 30 possible foods , and you have to pick five of them .
and there 's one group that 's not being leveraged in the way that it should be .
companies today , they collect mountains of data , so the first thing they can do is start donating that data .
they opened up their data in senegal and the ivory coast and researchers discovered that if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers , you can see where people are traveling .
in addition to donating their data , they need to donate their decision scientists .
in rome , at the world food programme , this took us five years to do , five years .
that first three years , ok , that was just what we could n't solve for .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
there 's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for .
they 've been doing it for years , and it 's led to major operational efficiency improvements .
just try to imagine your favorite beverage company trying to plan their inventory and not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves .
but on the other side , if you look at the natural systems , we have proteins that have two million types , can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds , or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
i mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot .
can we really scale this up ? can we really embed robotics into every part ?
on the right-hand side , [ 0,0 ] input is a 1 output , which goes up .
so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system .
so basically you have a chain of elements .
imagine if our buildings , our bridges , machines , all of our bricks could actually compute .
thank you .
`` would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? '' '' and the people thought for themselves , `` '' maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in , instead of having the second scenario . '' '' that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen . ''
and then people started to feel that there 's something new happening .
and then zine al-abidine ben ali decided to leave .
and now libya as you see it .
for 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in tahrir square .
`` you are protecting us by showing what is happening at tahrir square . '' '' i felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them , `` '' make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story — and they feel protected as well . '' '' so we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world . ''
we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world .
let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future .
is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?
it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident .
and then you put on your reserve , and then you put on your heavy rucksack .
he checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
then you load the aircraft , and then you stand up and you get on , and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this , in a line of people , and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft .
and it 's painful enough now — and i think it 's designed this way — it 's painful enough so you want to jump .
so you get in the aircraft , you 're flying along , and at 20 minutes out , these jumpmasters start giving you commands .
then they give you 10 minutes .
and that 's to boost everybody 's confidence , to show that you 're not scared .
i have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and i was n't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong .
`` so then you look around , you 're under a canopy and you say , `` '' this is good . '' '' now you prepare for the inevitable . ''
now the army teaches you to do five points of performance — the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles .
so now i do that tuesday morning jump , but it 's not any jump — that was september 11th , 2001 .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e. lee , john buford at gettysburg .
one of my first battalion commanders , i worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with lt. mcchrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds .
when 9/11 came , 46-year-old brig . gen. mcchrystal sees a whole new world .
entirely new requirement .
and so instead of giving orders , you 're now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose .
`` i asked , `` '' where were you on 9/11 ? '' '' and one young ranger in the back — his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind — he said , `` '' sir , i was in the sixth grade . '' '' and it reminded me that we 're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness , and yet he has different experiences , in many cases a different vocabulary , a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than i do and many of the other senior leaders . ''
it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise , because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot , that suddenly the things that we grew up doing was n't what the force was doing anymore .
i probably learned the most about relationships .
i learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
`` every ranger promises every other ranger , `` '' no matter what happens , no matter what it costs me , if you need me , i 'm coming . '' '' and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . ''
and indeed , for quite a few people , taking this nand2tetris pilgrimage , if you will , has turned into a life-changing experience .
so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4 , which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are .
we do n't replace teachers , by the way .
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
and this picture is taken in vietnam .
the communist khmer rouge enters phnom penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in vietnam , and american bombing campaigns .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it did n't actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
if she fails , we 're all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .
thank you mother .
it 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity .
what we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day .
what 's the problem ?
one satellite , one rocket .
it cost 855 million dollars .
`` we use `` '' release early , release often '' '' on our software . ''
in fact , the founders of our company , chris , robbie and i , we met over 15 years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference about exactly that question : how do you use satellites to help humanity ?
and this is what it 's going to do : acting in a single-orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun , the earth rotates underneath .
it 's a line scanner for the planet .
thank you .
we can track all of these things , every tree on the planet every day .
we want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data .
which brings me back to this .
and what i would like to leave you with is the following question : if you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day , what would you do with that data ?
well , i invite you to come and explore with us .
but you can understand the jokes that we get . sex begets babies .
that 's a subject that we want to dive into .
the sun was always streaming in , and our children would never be crying .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
rg : uh oh .
av : nothing more to be said .
i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
we thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against .
this is actually the last little image we have of him .
as i was working through that mourning process , i was amazed that i did n't want to see anybody .
and i think , miscarriage is an invisible loss .
so we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining .
we raised the money , and we 're thrilled that we did , because in this phase of one 's life , the incredibly scarce resource is time .
it 's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy , but they 're sometimes pretty quick .
rg : and so this is what — and we think that a lot of parents , when you get in there — in our case anyway — you pack your bags for a trip to europe , and you 're really excited to go .
now , if you do n't trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?
instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published , or saying wait until you 're older , my parents were really supportive .
and counting off by four ?
one-two-three-four , one-two-three , come on , y'all !
one-two-three-four , one-two-three . yeah . now , that 's what i call a-rhythm-etic . can you say it ? a-rhythm-etic . audience : a-rhythm-etic . cc : a-rhythm-etic . audience : a-rhythm-etic . cc : a-rhythm a-rhythm . audience : a-rhythm a-rhythm .
now it 's using a faster group of three we call a triplet .
all : triplet-triplet .
i specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places .
it 's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability .
i skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back . 800 miles in 10 weeks .
third one : how do you top that ? what 's next ?
this is about as good as maps get , and to reach it you 've got to ski literally over the frozen crust , the floating skin of ice on the artic ocean .
we had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months .
ultimately , we ran out of time .
`` we 've got to pick you up . '' '' and i felt that i had failed , wholeheartedly . ''
and of course , neither of these things happened .
we did n't get to the pole , and we did n't have any money to pay anyone to do the pr , so no one had heard of this expedition .
`` the lesson is : do n't even try . '' '' ( laughter ) fast forward three years . i did eventually get off the sofa , and start planning another expedition . this time , i wanted to go right across , on my own this time , from russia , at the top of the map , to the north pole , where the sort of kink in the middle is , and then on to canada . ''
`` our cameraman , who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times , actually asked the pilot , before we got on the plane , how long this flight would take , and the pilot — russian pilot — completely deadpan , replied , `` six hours — if we live . '' ''
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear , loaded up the helicopters — two helicopters flying in tandem — dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
we had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming , photography ; while the helicopter was still there , i did an interview on the satellite phone ; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter , wham , the door closed , and i was alone .
i 'm lying in the tent , getting ready to go .
later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice .
and this meant i could ski over very thin ice , and if i fell through , it was n't the end of the world .
it also meant , if the worst came to the worst , i could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me .
when you get lots of mist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up .
ninety degrees north — that is slap bang in the north pole .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sledge . did a sort of video diary piece .
i warmed the battery up in my armpit .
`` one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway , banking . i could see into the cockpit , troy battling the controls , and he just took one hand off , reached back , flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit , and it was the `` '' fasten seat belt '' '' sign you can see on the wall . ''
this is probably why i did n't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
why ? i 'm not an explorer in the traditional sense .
every south pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing — no one has ever made a return journey . so that 's the plan .
number 28 : when did you last cry in front of another person ?
and when people called or emailed , which they did every day for weeks , they always asked the same question first : are you guys still together ?
but i just was n't prepared for the scope of the response .
in fact , i do n't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love .
thank you .
you make me go to this . you make me listen .
and they came into my room the next morning .
and the real question is , what lessons did we learn ?
and it has been for 50 years an experiment .
well a part of it , of course , is k-12 .
we need to strengthen k-12 .
we need to find ways of making it happen .
smart simply means you 're ready to learn .
nice story . give him a hand for that too .
( applause ) secondly , it 's not about test scores only .
test scores are important , but they 're not the most important thing .
one young woman had great grades , but test scores were not as high .
you all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat .
they knew they were working on aids research .
give him a big hand for that .
do you know that ?
they need to be engaged .
and it 's working so well that throughout our university system in maryland , more and more courses are being redesigned .
if you do n't know it , there 's been a 79-percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000 .
most important , if a student has a sense of self , it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world .
`` it represents the wisest option among many alternatives . '' '' and then he said something that gives me goosebumps . ''
( applause )
it 's a talking horse .
so how does this work ?
when the rescue workers came , they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .
at the end of that you 're completely fried , your brain .
i started learning about the world-record holder .
and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .
my first attempt on pure o2 , i was able to go up to 15 minutes .
i wanted to get the science times to document this .
i wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
so , i had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose , which was a real problem for me .
it would start . it would stop . and i felt all this .
i started a group called open source ecology .
i 've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
from what i 've seen , this is only the beginning .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
it carries male sex cells from one flower to another .
and remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well .
but not all pollen is quite so simple looking .
now , pollen from plants , which are wind-dispersed — like trees and grasses and so on — tend to cause the most hay fever .
that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized , this pollen .
and i 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near london , and that 55 million years ago london was full of mangroves .
is n't that cool ?
all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope , actually in the lab at kew laboratories .
so , if you have a pollen sample , then in principle , you should be able to tell where that sample came from .
and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing , certainly in the u.k. , to within an area that 's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim .
and finally , in a rather grizzly way , the bosnia war crimes ; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen , which showed that bodies had been buried , exhumed and then reburied somewhere else .
they ask if it should have reproduction in it , or metabolism , or evolution .
so this is a computer program .
so now , if you take this metaphor [ of ] genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact , as is jim watson , craig venter , as are all of us .
and in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true , there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you .
if your bank account 's one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
there 's the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately , is it will do a developmental computation , a molecular computation , and it 'll build an electronic computer .
and if you buy all of this , and you think life is about computation , as i do , then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .
almost — many of them are impossible .
but for some tasks , we can start to answer them .
it 's double-stranded , it 's a double helix , has the as , ts , cs and gs that pair to hold the strands together .
we want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix .
now , we ca n't actually take a movie of this process , but shawn douglas at harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure .
so , you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface , and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful rendition of china , which even has taiwan , and you can see it 's sort of on the world 's shortest leash , right ?
now , i want to get back to that compiler .
and if you look at their sticky ends , these little dna bits , you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern .
so , these tiles would make a complicated , self-assembling checkerboard .
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
so , that answers that sort of first question i was talking about .
now , this — using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on craig venter 's question .
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it , the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory .
it 's a molecular computer building an electronic computer .
( laughter ) so , it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago , and that 's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things , so i think we made a lot of progress .
and the computations that it uses , they 're molecular computations , and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it , as feynman said , you know , we need to build something to understand it .
one was a passion for rodents .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you ca n't really enter into the land .
because , are n't they vermin ?
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people .
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
especially in africa where t.b . and hiv are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
it means that , if you have t.b. , you have more chance that you wo n't be detected , but will just die from t.b . secondary infections and so on .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in hiv-positives .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
a cage like this — ( applause ) a cage like this — provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats — a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day , the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?
you can get a mercedes for a very high price , very high performance .
that 's how i 'm standing before you .
`` and then he said , `` '' well , i must give them a car that they can afford , one lakh car , $ 2,000 car . '' '' of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that 's what was said by suzuki . ''
and mind you , i 'm six feet half an inch , ratan is taller than me , and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car .
`` and of course , nothing succeeds like success ; the cynics then turned around , and one after the other they also started saying , `` '' yes , we also want to make a car in the nano segment . ''
and the seat riser , for example , serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity .
but the current entry-level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less , but 21 percent more inside space .
the driver 's name is naran .
he has bought his own nano .
and of course , these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads .
four billion people , their incomes are less then two dollars a day .
( music ) see , he jumps . you can see what stress it must have .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
so actually we are getting less from more for less and less people .
can we do it [ for ] 100 dollars ?
the indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge , however , scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men , not molecule to mice to men , you know .
this is really getting more from less for more and more people , because these are all affordable treatments now .
it 's not about low cost .
because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day .
you 're talking about inclusive innovation .
what was that ?
so ladies and gentlemen , i 'm very happy to announce , this gift of the 21st century to the world from india , gandhian engineering .
was there a vision you had ? what is it that drove you ?
one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
`` i said , `` '' whoa , science is so wonderful , i have to become a scientist . '' '' but more importantly , focus and you can achieve . ''
and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
this is convex lens leadership .
and currently i 'm president of global research alliance , 60,000 scientists in nine counties , right from india to the u.s .
i 'm trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike .
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location .
place cells are also being recorded in humans .
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one .
so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains .
is n't that cool ?
my father was a san franciscan .
i still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me .
but to five-year-old me , i thought it was kind of nice that they 'd lit the way for me to pee .
we were denied service , and categorized as enemy non-alien .
the germans were embedded in this mountain hillside , rocky hillside , in impregnable caves , and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months , and they were stalemated .
they climbed all night long on that sheer cliff .
not a single one cried out , so as not to give their position away .
the men climbed for eight hours straight , and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light , and as soon as light broke , they attacked .
they are my heroes and my father is my hero , who understood democracy and guided me through it .
thank you very much .
what is love ?
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
the individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules .
we can basically summarize it through a triple process .
in other words , my value was once ensured by submitting myself to the traditional authorities .
but we can , for instance , imagine a dating website which , a bit like those loyalty points programs , uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age , my height/weight ratio , my degree , my salary , or the number of clicks on my profile .
everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction .
i 'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo-fascist or religious communes .
i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem .
we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done .
we 're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later ?
what they look at is the most important thing .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four-year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . and that 's why they 're so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what 's good .
you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid — and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people were n't having the courage to try .
well , what did i do when i was a kid ?
and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
and some 3,000 of those are flying . of course , one of them is around the world voyager . i founded another company in '82 , which is my company now .
and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly , taken out of service .
this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in 1961 .
three years , and we ca n't do that now . crazy .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 .
our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that .
there 's another one announced just last week .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you 'll see those resort hotels in orbit .
and the inventor is in this audience .
paul allen , elan musk , richard branson , jeff bezos , the ansari family , which is now funding the russians ' sub-orbital thing , bob bigelow , a private space station , and carmack .
you remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
i think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we 're first or not really does n't matter .
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply .
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
why ? well , the short story is , our sponsors split on us .
and then in the 20th century a lot of things changed .
the result was that lifespans extended from about 45 at the start of the century to almost double that today .
you know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs .
another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them .
( applause ) it 's really quite an honor to be here tonight , and i 'm really glad that i stayed here and listened because i 've really been inspired .
♫ and i got all the answers ♫ ♫ and i do n't have to understand ♫ ♫ 'cause i got all the answers . ♫ ♫ think i 'll rummage through the century ♫ ♫ while i listen to the sea . ♫ ♫ oh , it 's good to be so free , ♫ ♫ so free . ♫ ♫ who was mayor of chicago ♫ ♫ back in 1964 ? ♫ ♫ and why did shakespeare create iago ♫ ♫ to tear apart a love so pure ? ♫ ♫ how can my dreams be so vivid ♫ ♫ in a psychosonic way ? ♫ ♫ why must i become so livid ♫

and that 's what i want to talk about today . ( laughter ) ah , you laugh , you fools . ( laughter ) ( voice : can we finish up a little early ? ) ( laughter ) yeah , we need the time !
so , i do n't know how much civilization really has progressed since ad 79 , but there 's a great likelihood . i really believe this , and i do n't believe in aliens , and i do n't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that . but there 's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own .
so , what are the solutions to this ? ( laughter ) thank god you can all read !
it may seem ridiculous , but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them .
and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point .
we 're going to have to say , no more logging in the amazon for 20 years .
they are expecting to create little , tiny black holes .
but the thing that 's alarming is a couple of months ago , in mexico , where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal , they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants .
but what happens , as this occurs , is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth over the period of about 100 years , and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun , that this field protects us from , are — well , basically , we 're gon na fry . ( laughter ) ( voice : steve , i have some additional hats downstairs . ) sp : so , what can we do about this ? oh , by the way , we 're overdue .
you do n't need that much up there .
in 1918 , we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed 20 million people .
aids is coming back . ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency , and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics .
a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come , and change and mutate .
the danger is that some germ like staph will be — will mutate into something that 's really virulent , very contagious , and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it .
we think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the milky way alone , our galaxy .
and finally , number one : biggest danger to life as we know it , i think , a really big asteroid heads for earth .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
andrew , can you put that chart up ?
we do n't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories , or when one with our name on it might arrive .
but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it , which would gently , slowly , after a period of time , push it into a different trajectory , which , if we 've done our math right , would keep it from hitting earth .
thank you .
and the greater london authority has been aware of this for a while , and the main causes are population growth , the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full .
( laughter ) so what if you wanted to try this yourself at home ?
but that 's pretty much it for formal requirements .
so what i find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death .
they 're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us .
obviously , it 's difficult to calculate .
and that 's just the first few days , and just britain .
and of course that crowd is growing all the time , because every week , every month , more people will keep downloading and keep watching .
`` the berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week , and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of may , runner-up only to `` '' american idol . '' '' the al-qaeda-linked website that first showed nick berg 's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site . ''
one dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from 300,000 to 750,000 every time a beheading in iraq was shown .
social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before , but if we take another step back in history , we 'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle .
there could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed .
the streets were packed .
today , we are all offered front row seats .
it 's already happened .
all these things make it easier as an internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death , to push our personal boundaries , to test our sense of shock , to explore our sense of shock .
we should stop watching , but we know we wo n't .
`` people used to say , `` '' oh , the shrunken head museum , the shrunken head museum ! '' '' and at the time , i was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls . ''
i believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops , which should go some way to providing food security in the world , lies in resurrection plants , pictured here , in an extremely droughted state .
that percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change .
and the reason for this is water .
plants ca n't .
most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss .
it 's also called the upside-down tree , simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down .
annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies .
the next time the rainy season comes , they germinate and grow , and the whole cycle just starts again .
but back to annuals as our major form of food supplies .
( applause ) pretty amazing , huh ?
how do these plants dry without dying ?
and i work on a variety of different resurrection plants , shown here in the hydrated and dry states , for a number of reasons .
most genes will code for proteins , so we look at the proteome .
lipids also act as signals to turn on genes .
some of you might have them at home .
each eye is controlling a different device .
`` i said , `` '' you could 've gotten me fired . '' '' and he said , `` '' let 's get married . '' '' ( laughter ) `` travel the world and have lots of kids . '' ''
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we could n't do .
more specialists .
he started it just two weeks ago .
`` i say , `` '' keep him alive if you can . '' '' and terence died six days later . ''
we fought together , we lived together .
i had them right at hand .
i saw it firsthand .
maybe i wanted to believe it .
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .
people did mention hospice , but i would n't listen .
so maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end , and for saying goodbye , and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight , and a hero 's goodbye .
and he 's been a pretty good general .
and he suddenly knows he 's been deserted by the gods , and it 's time to let go .
but that 's easily said .
but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in .
who would have imagined that germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of oxford of 1943 ?
our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century .
they need different ways of being approached , different ways of being enfranchised , different ways of being skilled .
second is , you 're problem solvers , but you 're not engaging your global responsibility .
but , particularly , what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work .
and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor , through this means .
is the country gon na make it ?
no . but seriously , the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as , at least , a 10- to 20-year perspective .
time has been compressed .
but in my world — you know , when i went back to afghanistan after 23 years , space had expanded .
second is , when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense , brutal forms of exercise of power — we had the red army for 10 continuous years , 110,000 strong , literally terrorizing .
and the russians , equally .
you know , when i went back in december of 2001 , i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i 'd lived as a nationalist .
you know , they engage .
and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is — clare lockhart is here , so i 'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan .
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
you play baseball when it 's baseball season and when there 's a game on the schedule .
it 's not exactly your choice .
( laughter ) and because it 's an internal desire , we actually have some sense of control over that .
you talk about what you like .
you ca n't hit the ball and run to right field .
there were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms , and there were thousands of unused materials and resources .
and then , there were the teachers , who were incredibly afraid for their own safety , so they had low expectations for the students and themselves , and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture .
but this can change .
anybody who 's ever worked with me will tell you i am known for my slogans .
we used two dumpsters per day .
but because of my amazing mother , i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me .
and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language — the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary , it will already be well out of date .
the problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
`` you can say , `` '' give a muffin to a mouse , '' '' the prepositional dative . ''
you 've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences .
only humans can possess things .
so why should anyone care ?
`` and he says , `` '' i was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in fargo , '' '' which everyone , including the audience , interprets as a veiled bribe . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` would you like to come up and see my etchings ? '' ''
i think most people understand the intent behind that .
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , solicitations and threats so often veiled ?
both parties know exactly what the speaker means , and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows , etc. , etc .
for example , communality applies most naturally within family or friends , but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it .
or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal , that would be rather awkward as well .
you have to convey the actual content — here we get back to the container metaphor .
the simplest example of this is in the polite request .
by expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
so you get the best of both worlds .
some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .
here it is .
he was 15 , a freshman in high school .
the first week i spent in this neighborhood , i saw two boys , five and seven years old , play this game of chase , where the older boy ran after the other boy .
he played the cop .
in the first 18 months that i lived in this neighborhood , i wrote down every time i saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors .
so in the first 18 months , i watched the police stop pedestrians or people in cars , search people , run people 's names , chase people through the streets , pull people in for questioning , or make an arrest every single day , with five exceptions .
the family was really struggling .
well , my answer would be no .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery , prevention , civic inclusion , rather than punishment ?
i know that we 're near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion .
richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by , and everybody was upset with him .
`` and finally , john belk said , `` do you know who 's sitting here ? '' ''
i know that as you have been peering into the future , and as we 've heard some of it here tonight , i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be .
but about two centuries before david , the hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron , and , slowly , that skill spread .
the first one that david saw was human evil .
`` and yet he says , `` he restores my soul . '' ''
racism and injustice and violence sweep our world , bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death .
the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology , horribly used .
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
i have n't given a talk in nearly four months .
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere , i 'm ad-libbing .
i 'm not reading . i never read an address .
why do we suffer ? it 's an age-old question that we have n't answered .
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
and they 're — they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person .
as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote , he said , there 's every activity under heaven .
i 've stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
and of course , you are all familiar with the computer language named for him .
`` he wrote in his journal these words : `` '' i submit myself , absolutely , to jesus christ , my redeemer . '' '' a french historian said , two centuries later , `` '' seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of jesus christ . '' '' pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony , but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven , and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven . ''
`` essentially , he said this : `` '' if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you 're wrong . ''
i milked cows every morning , and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school .
i did n't make them in college , until something happened in my heart .
which was he ?
but by faith i said , i believe him , and he came into my heart and changed my life .
now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize , because when you remove the fear of failure , impossible things suddenly become possible .
if you really ask yourself this question , you ca n't help but feel uncomfortable .
sure , good things happen , but amazing things stop happening .
the flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet .
one year later , the next declarations of impossibilities began .
`` ferdinand foch , a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army , said , `` '' airplanes are interesting toys , but of no military value . '' '' 40 years later , aero experts coined the term transonic . ''
and on that first flight we got more data than in all u-2 missions combined .
at mach 20 , we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
at that speed , the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel — 3,500 degrees fahrenheit — like a blast furnace .
if a mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from new york to long beach , a hummingbird would take , well , days .
and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans ca n't go , we 'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so .
tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
now they were able to do so by working together .
they are nerds , and they are heroes among us .
they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure . they remind us
it mattered to me .
we 've got to fly it first .
and you have to revisit these questions over time .
it took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly .
that 's what we do .
they downloaded it from disney.com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
so at the end of it , we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own , irrespective of who or where they were .
after that , i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own .
this is what these children are doing .
( laughter ) and indeed they had .
at that time , a large amount of money had come into newcastle university to improve schooling in india .
i came back after two months , and the 26 children marched in looking very , very quiet .
`` one of the referees who refereed the paper said , `` it 's too good to be true , '' which was not very nice . ''
so i came back to newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
`` `` '' you can exchange groups . ''
`` you can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they 're doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . '' '' and i explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method . ''
i gave them six gcse questions .
`` the teachers said , `` '' is this deep learning ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , let 's try it . ''
there was photographic recall inside the children , i suspect because they 're discussing with each other .
well , you know , they 're very vigorous people , british grandmothers .
they wanted to be footballers before .
i went to turin in may .
`` there was silence for a while , then they said , `` '' you 've spelled it wrong . ''
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
yeah . i thought so . i 'm also not surprised .
but that ca n't be the answer , because these drugs actually do n't work all that well .
and my eponymous colleague , seymour benzer , believed it as well .
so that means that these flies have two abnormalities , or phenotypes , as we geneticists call them , that one finds in adhd : hyperactivity and learning disability .
now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this .
but in each fly , we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity .
but i actually walked away with a great job offer .
so you 're ( laughter ) you 're really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
he did n't want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
you 're just in there , watching the incredible , subtle changes of color in the sky .
and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far .
( applause )
it 's a fantastic achievement , and yet , it hides a paradox , which is that nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil .
if you know one thing about our country , it 's that we do n't have an army .
so we abolished it .
by abolishing the army , we were able to turn military spending into social spending , and that was a driver of stability .
the news went viral around the world .
it 's about the country that we want and the cities that we have and the cities that we want and who makes that choice .
i 've spent my life working on sustainability .
the first number is three : three billion people .
we 're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees , we 're heading toward six degrees .
the third number is 12 : that 's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born .
and if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050 , that 's the century when we build all the world 's cities , the century that we 're in the middle of right now .
it 's about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business ?
i 'm going to refer to some of those as well , and i 'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we 've got .
we know from asking people from china to the u.s .
can i pay the bills at the end of the month ?
so we 've worked with others , with other businesses and ngos , on the better cotton initiative , working right back down to the farm , and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs , the yields increase , and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports .
again , we 're going all-in .
by 2015 , we 'll be 100 percent better cotton .
now together , through our supply chain , with partners , we 've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry .
so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind ?
so we 're going 100 percent renewable .
but then we 've got to look beyond our operations , and i think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain .
many businesses now , fortunately , have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains , but not every business . far from it .
and this came in ikea actually in the '90s .
so a code of conduct was developed , and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor .
if you 're not measuring things , you do n't care and you do n't know .
is n't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women ?
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
so we 've launched a women 's open network this week in ikea , and we 'll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
but i do n't think any of those businesses would say they 're perfect . we certainly would n't .
and together , we can help create a sustainable world , and , if we get it right , we can make sustainability affordable for the many people , not a luxury for the few .
i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now , who have lost her children .
`` also one thing that kept me pushing this story , this painful stories out , the dreams i have , sometimes , is like the voices of the dead , that i have seen would tell me , `` '' do n't give up . keep on going . '' '' because sometime i feel like stopping and not doing it , because i did n't know what i was putting myself into . ''
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .
but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head .
luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .
so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose : should i continue to hate , or let it go ?
but still as i wonder , i wo n't go under .
i saw sergeant command raising his hand , no retreat , no surrender .
it 's like i 'm living a dream .
my country is war-torn .
i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy .
one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when i was still a soldier back then .
so we party and dance to their music .
and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers .
and i 'm doing this because also it 's a normal thing in my home , people eat one meal a day .
( laughter ) but that moved me .
i 'm willing to die for this , because i know what it can do to my people .
so these people , you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid .
it 's rain . africa is fertile . they can grow the crops .
but if you invest in education then we 'll be able to change africa .
that 's what i want to do to change , to make a difference in the world .
so she even ended up marrying a commander from the spla .
one of them happened to be me now .

ca : so what is your foundation doing to promote this issue ?
whether this is a personal decision — whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home — or a national decision — where you 're going to invade some foreign country — you 're going to trade off something , either money or time , convenience , capabilities , maybe fundamental liberties .
you 've heard in the past several years , the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power .
that might be true , but it 's not terribly relevant .
and you can make your own decision , and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us do n't .
we often wo n't even notice them .
imagine a rabbit in a field , eating grass , and the rabbit 's going to see a fox .
and if you think about it , the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce , and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve .
a lot of good experiments in this .
so once you take up skydiving or smoking , you downplay the risks .
if a risk is thrust upon you — terrorism was a good example — you 'll overplay it because you do n't feel like it 's in your control .
this works until you invent newspapers .
and there 's some basic innumeracy going on .
we 're really good at small numbers .
so we have trouble with the risks that are n't very common .
now you either have a feeling — you feel more secure than you are .
maybe it 's what the cia 's supposed to do for us .
if economics , if the market , drives security , and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security , then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure .
so let me complicate things .
there 's no feeling about germs .
you need a model to understand them .
but it has the ability to override our feelings .
he had some very complex models of how to survive .
models are not static .
so an example might be , if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common , there were a lot of fears about it .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
or think of the risks on the internet across generations — how your parents approach internet security , versus how you do , versus how our kids will .
when swine flu first appeared , the initial news caused a lot of overreaction .
and those two things made the risk more than it was .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
and most security decisions have a variety of people involved .
and you see agenda — this is marketing , this is politics — trying to convince you to have one model versus another , trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings , marginalizing people with models you do n't like .
all examples of models changing .
models are hard to dislodge .
so evidence against our model , we 're likely to ignore , even if it 's compelling .
i flew here yesterday .
i did n't check the airplane .
one , you can fix people 's feelings , directly appeal to feelings .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
thank you .
i 'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures .
i want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after i 'll speak .
very few things went to the market .
brazil was starting to urbanize , industrialize , and i knew the politics . i became a little bit radical , i was a member of leftist parties , and i became an activist .
but i did much more than that .
i put photography as my life .
i lived totally inside photography doing long term projects , and i want to show you just a few pictures of — again , you 'll see inside the social projects , that i went to , i published many books on these photographs , but i 'll just show you a few ones now .
this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds , and we did n't know how to deal with these .
we transformed . we gave this land back to nature .
gone very fast , disappeared .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
land completely destroyed , the erosion there , the land had dried .
by an accident that happened to me , we went back , we built an ecosystem .
that 's the way loudspeakers pretty much are .
a little bit of differential , but not much .
and hopefully they 'll be sensitive that they do n't want to offend you with just one more outlet .
so , we create silence as much as we create sound .
we 're also working on noise canceling things like snoring , noise from automobiles .
it 's not any more pricey than regular electronics .
instead of being made on the face of the cone , it 's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air , and so when i aim it towards you , what you hear is made right next to your ears .
i said we can shorten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch .
so , the stage is more restricted — the sound stage that 's supposed to spread out in front of you .
( laughter ) i was seeing if you were listening .
actually , i have n't had breakfast yet .
i 'm serious . and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance , and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
i invented a plasma antenna , to shift gears .
i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified , when the patent issued , and told the people back there about it , and they laughed , and then i took them back a demo and they bought .
if you have n't heard it , raise your hand .
so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college .
narrator : we are all aware of the risk of cancer , but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us : arthritis .
`` first thing for my wife , and the most common thing i hear from my patients , particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group , 70-year-old age group , is they come in and say , `` '' hey , doc , is n't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee ? ''
and it works , not just for my wife , but certainly for other patients .
the girl on the video , jen hudak , just won the superpipe in aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee , as you see in the other image — and having a paste graft to that knee .
we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about , which is called simplicity .
i 'm trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period .
but i kept writing bad poetry , and he did n't blow up the math building , but he went to cuba .
so , in writing for children , it seems simple , and it is .
and david remnick , who was really wonderful about it , had one problem . he did n't like al zheimers , because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer 's .
and i did n't — and i 'd never used it in school , because i was too busy writing poems , and flunking out , and i do n't know what , sitting in cafes .
but i picked it up and i started reading it and i thought , this book is amazing .
and i took the examples that they gave , and just did 56 paintings , basically .
and then , we do n't have a stuffed spinoza , but we do have a stuffed pavlov 's dog , and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st. petersburg , in russia .
oh my god , you know what ?
could we have — no , we do n't have time .
( music ) ok. i taped my — my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
`` ( laughter ) i went to visit kitty carlisle hart , and she is 96 , and when i brought her a copy of `` '' the elements of style , '' '' she said she would treasure it . ''
`` and then i said — oh , and she was talking about moss hart , and i said , `` when you met him , you knew it was him . '' ''
and then i go and have some tea .
this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in 2002 to watch the minerals management service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .
and what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil , you see some ice cubes , and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm .
we 're four percent of the world 's population ; we use 25 percent of the world 's oil production .
oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen — that 's methane — it just floats off .
those are called the asphaltenes ; they 're an ingredient in asphalt .
they 're very important in oil spills .
the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
i 'm so angry about it . the oil companies are ripping me off .
they set the prices , and i do n't even know .
and the thing is , too , is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume , which is somewhat reasonable , because in fact , we have designed this system where , if you want to get a job , it 's much more important to have a car that runs , to have a job and keep a job , than to have a ged .
and so , cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil , and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill .
they were n't farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .
but in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
`` and here 's one of the things that ida tarbell said — she said , `` '' he has a thin nose like a thorn . ''
and so i 'm not saying these guys are n't liable to answer questions — i 'm just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you do n't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you 're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil .
they really influence people .
it started earth day .
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .
we need to focus really back again on the molecules .
for example , we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000 .
we need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil .
you may have heard of some of them .
there has been terrorism . there have been random bombs .
and if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years , we have had more than 5.7 million displaced population .
demobilize .
but we did n't know very much about it .
i know you 're wondering if they did meet .
i do n't know if they 're together now , but i can find out . ( laughter ) but what i can tell you is that our radio strategy was working .
we 'll have commanders talking to commanders .
`` we asked them , `` '' can you send guerrillas a message ? '' '' we collected over 6,000 messages . ''
`` so this was television , this was all different types of media saying , `` we are saving a place for you . '' ''
if that is true , advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available .
other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
what they 're very good at doing is hitchhiking , particularly the eggs .
so we must be good at killing mosquitos .
you use chemicals . you put them into water where they breed .
so it 's not very effective , but it 's probably the best thing we 've got at the moment .
we want something that gets that population right the way down so it ca n't get the disease transmission .
clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans .
we do n't want to do anything that you ca n't undo .
we want something that 's relatively cheap , or cost-effective , because there 's an awful lot of countries involved , and some of them are emerging markets , some of them emerging countries , low-income .
you want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue , but you do n't really want to get all the other insects .
if there 's a male mosquito that you release , and if there 's a female around , that male will find the female .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
and in fact , the numbers after that get , those get very difficult to count , because there just are n't any left .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
so that 's where we stand at the moment , and i 've just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we 've now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
we have g.m . crops , we have pharmaceuticals , we have new vaccines , all using roughly the same technology , but with very different outcomes .
the youth can beat you .
if you do n't work together with [ the party ] , you will lead a very bad life .
they understood somebody is following them .
they got scared . impunity was broken .
it took me a while , but eventually i refused to serve in the west bank and had to spend time in jail .
and i have to warn you , some of you might find them quite explicit .
let 's see what happened .
the guy in green is palestinian .
he 's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet .
he is okay .
he 's a filmmaker and an activist .
we tried to understand how we can help .
where i used to work before , in the west bank , one can take a camera out , most likely not going to get shot , but in places we wanted to work , just try to pull a phone out , and you 're dead — literally dead .
you can buy them off the shelf .
to have an effect , the key thing is how you use the material .
i used to carry a big gun .
by putting the right images in the right hands at the right time , we can truly create an impact .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
after their deaths , a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute .
someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers , inventing the first musical keyboard .
there 's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies that came out of play : public museums , rubber , probability theory , the insurance business and many more .
you 'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun .
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it does n't show the thickness of the ice .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue — that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours — 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americas , extending westward , and on either side of the indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
so do n't worry about climate change .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
`` al gore : there is an old african proverb that says , `` '' if you want to go quickly , go alone . ''
now , that 's equivalent to about 18 olympic-sized swimming pools .
`` it 's called `` '' different kinds of air : a plant 's diary , '' '' where i was recreating the air from different eras in earth 's evolution , and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me . ''
now , i 'm not a scientist , but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology , a bit like how rocks can oxidize , and they 'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it , such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times .
to breathe , this air is really clean and really fresh .
so with all this thinking about air of the past , it 's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future .
it 's so heavy , in fact , that when you breathe it in , whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well , so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor and soak into the cracks .
so this ethical confrontation is really central to my work .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs .
`` and that problem is , `` '' how is it so easy to know other minds ? '' '' so to start with an illustration , you need almost no information , one snapshot of a stranger , to guess what this woman is thinking , or what this man is . ''
and to try to understand how you can put together simple units , simple messages over space and time , in a network , and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds .
it 's called the right temporo-parietal junction .
rs : that one is joshua 's . that 's right .
oh yeah , you were right . he took that one .
uh-oh . why did he take that one ?
and second , when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his , where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his , the three-year-old comes up with another explanation : he 's not taking his own sandwich because he does n't want it , because now it 's dirty , on the ground .
so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich .
child : um , yeah .
and actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds , getting into early adolescence , they still do n't have quite an adult-like brain region .
but of course , as you 're probably aware , even in adulthood , people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it and how accurately .
okay . good . ( laughter ) so we ask people , how much should grace be blamed in this case , which we call a failed attempt to harm ?
now she thinks the powder is sugar .
and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment .
so what i 'm showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region , and from top to bottom , how much blame people said that grace deserved .
i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .
so then seriously , you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads .
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
( applause )
and i have an academy , a part of the university of fine arts in berlin .
do you mind looking , with me , at that little cross in the center there ?
so just keep looking . do n't mind me .
so you will have a yellow circle , and we will do an after-image experiment .
`` `` '' and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility ? '' '' is art about that ? ''
and it 's on the other side also , i think , quite beautiful , as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas , in these different places of the world .
and if i vote it makes a difference .
this summer , in new york : there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall .
it 's about being together .
silence is rwandan genocide . silence is katrina .
( applause )
in other words , they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity .
because primarily of the power of the internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
30 percent of our households gave .
when i became president in 1993 , there were none of these organizations in russia .
then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines , one of whom was cited in the film , and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy , because even at 500 dollars , these drugs were being sold on a high-margin , low-volume , uncertain-payment basis .
i joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against aids was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy .
children 's medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it .
we just reorganized the markets .
we need a movie on those six categories .
i 'll tell you a little bit about our team because it 's indicative of what we do .
and then we have others working in these other related programs .
when we came to this rural area , 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition .
mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .
that 's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
i am grateful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
thank you and god bless you .
the feeling of adventure as i climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time .
nine times , i climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast .
the bar was now much , much higher .
and these boats were exciting to sail .
this was a training sail off the french coast .
the nearest land was antarctica , and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me .
we were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge .
that 's what it 's like in the southern ocean .
eight sail changes in 12 hours .
and never in my life had i ever translated that definition of finite that i 'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until i stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record .
and it made me make a decision i never thought i would make : to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge i 'd ever come across : the future of our global economy .
it would n't fix the system .
is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital ?
`` could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use ? '' '' yes was the answer to the decoupling , but also yes , we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering 2.7 times . ''
when you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather , anything 's possible .
and below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until february , and then they 're shipped out to the almonds .
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
in some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called israeli acute paralysis virus .
we think perhaps it 's a combination of factors .
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out .
and haiti , if you 've ever been there , is just a tragedy .
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . and so that ingenuity is inspiring .
but if you 're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you ca n't survive three years in a row . and we 're really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
and if you look at florida , in dade city , florida , that 's where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go .
and if you 're ever in central valley in february , you go to this café at 10 o'clock in the morning , kathy and kate 's .
now , i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning — a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , i should have had whole wheat bread , i realized , but you know , jam on my wonderbread , and some coffee — and had we taken out all those ingredients , — except for the almonds i was n't going to pick out from the granola — if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we would n't have much on our plate .
it 's said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom .
however , honeybees are a minority .
in pennsylvania alone , we have been surveying bees for 150 years , and very intensely in the last three years .
we have bumblebees on the top .
( laughter ) what these bees do is , they sit there . these solitary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect pollen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they 're top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
it 's a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
and i want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ?
how clever would we have to be ?
we love new stuff — new material stuff for sure — but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic — the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth .
a life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the hdtv , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and ipad , the list goes on — an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety .
is this really how people are ?
the first one is in the crisis itself .
they want to spend less and save more .
`` keynes called this the `` '' paradox of thrift '' '' — saving slows down recovery . ''
these things save carbon , they save energy , they save us money .
`` ( laughter ) `` here they are , the giraffes . '' ''
these ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here outside barrow-in-furness in cumbria .
and these tensions have deep evolutionary roots , so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances — fight or flight .
and perhaps even more interesting from our point of view , another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation .
it 's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy .
only now , investment is n't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth .
investment has to be a different beast .
but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
so this is not just a western post-materialist fantasy .
`` ubuntu says , `` '' i am because we are . '' '' prosperity is a shared endeavor . ''
what we 're doing here is we 're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose .
and actually in the period through which we 've been working over the last 18 years — partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics — actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world .
if you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , i would take the two percent .
it 's a rare condition .
i can see it in their eyes .
or look at the foreign word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it 's pointing you towards ?
the sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
64 multiplied by 75 .
what about 75 ?
for this climate crisis , we assembled a network , really , of superstars , from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders . fifty or so of them .
the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning , then lighting , and then refrigeration .
it is stupid that we use two tons of steel , glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall .
it 's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here .
i 'm really afraid , because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough .
so , eight of us went to sacramento in august and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for ab32 .
( applause ) please . thank you .
well , we went to brazil to meet dr. jose goldemberg .
it 's created a million jobs inside that country , and it 's saved 32 million tons of co2 . it 's really substantial .
in fact , i 'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough .
the fourth and final lesson we 've learned is about the potential of radical innovation .
so , a team of berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering , designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient , called artemisinin , and they 're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .
this leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products .
so , if all goes well , they 're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels .
well , i 'll tell you what . green technologies — going green — is bigger than the internet .
go to climatecrisis.org or carboncalculator.com and buy carbon credits . you could join other leaders in mandating , lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u.s. greenhouse gas reductions .
and the most important thing you can do , i think , is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business , your institution , in going green .
really think outside the box .
i ca n't wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis .
( applause )
`` i said , `` '' no , it 's — it 's penguin shit . '' '' ( laughter ) and , you know , `` '' excuse me ! '' '' and i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically . ( laughter ) ''
`` so , i said , `` '' no , no , really — it 's penguin shit . '' '' ( laughter ) because i had just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins . ''
actually , technically , it 's not a rectum . it 's called a cloaca .
`` why on earth ? and if you have n't read jared diamond 's book , `` '' collapse , '' '' i totally recommend that you do . ''
basically , these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these .
one interesting problem is the stone is n't very hard .
i also have an archaeological project going on in egypt .
so , i 'll talk about it at a future ted .
it 's the kind of very high-risk , but potentially very high-return thing that we do .
it may not seem that , but if you were a microwave , this is how you would view it .
metamaterials , unfortunately — a , it only works on microwave , and b , it does n't work all that well yet .
it 's — you know , today i 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business , but , in fact , it 's negative .
and these happen to be my eyes , by the way .
and i 'm trying to use a very scientific approach .
she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years — may not ever .
so , i like to support people that are risking their lives .
`` is that you ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , you know , it 's just a movie ! come on . '' '' ( laughter ) so , the seti institute , with a little bit of help from me , and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people , is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek , california , so they can do this seti work . ''
it 's horrible conditions , because wherever you have nice weather , plants grow , and you do n't get any erosion , and you do n't see any dinosaurs .
you know , skiers pray for snow ?
so , you hike around and — this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
you hike around , you see something like this .
i 'd gone up to photograph orcas , and we had looked for a week , and we had n't seen a damn orca .
and i get lots of pictures like this .
`` and say , `` '' yeah , you know , i — this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep , but that 's really what works for me . '' '' and regardless of whether it 's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex , the common — or lowest common denominator — is me . ''
`` in africa we say , `` '' god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time . '' '' ( laughter ) i think , how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in 18 minutes ? ''
this is where i 'm coming from .
i 'm a himba and namibian .
i was born in 1971 .
and as a result , we were fined and locked up in jail .
between 1966 and 1990 , the u.s. and soviet interests fought for control over my country .
death and despair surrounded joshua and our entire communities .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
and that was my father . my father has been a poacher for quite a long time . instead of shooting poachers dead
three things that actually help to build on this foundation : the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas .
we have already reshaped conservation in the entire country .
( applause )
it does n't matter whether you 're a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
unfortunately , there 's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world .
our teachers deserve better .
the u.s. is tied for 15th in reading , but we 're 23rd in science and 31st in math .
now , they rank number one across the board , in reading , math and science , and one of the keys to shanghai 's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
in fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains .
you do n't need anybody 's permission to create something great .
well , there 's also another interesting thing .
so the five of us , two americans , two italians and a spaniard , we — ( laughter ) you know , it 's a worldwide project . ( laughter ) so we came together in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea , which was teaching interaction design , this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things .
and actually , with arduino , we have kids like sylvia that you see here , that actually make projects with arduino .
you know , when i was learning about programming , i learned by looking at other people 's code , or looking at other people 's circuits in magazines .
the documentation and the hands-on teaching methodology is also open-source and released as the creative commons .
so this one is a quadcopter .
mr : our producers caught up with kim kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her — mb : eh ? ( laughter ) mr : it should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian 's wedding .
so you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall , and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans , so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages .
or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts . ( laughter ) it 's interesting how , in 2009 , gizmodo basically defined , said that this project actually gives a meaning to twitter , so it was — a lot changed in between . ( laughter ) so very serious project .
or you get kids , like these kids , they 're from spain .
so we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices , to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real .
it 's a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . so if you know how to use arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
it does n't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger , but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people , changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes .
so what do i mean by color changes ?
that change is incredibly subtle , which is why , when you look at other people , when you look at the person sitting next to you , you do n't see their skin or their face changing color .
it 's a video i recorded about three years ago .
so i too got one of those baby monitors so that i could see my daughter when she was asleep .
you can see the baby 's sleeping , but there 's not too much information there .
and it turns out , there 's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope .
and you know it 's not real science unless you use guinea pigs , and apparently this guinea pig is called tiffany , and this youtube user claims it is the first rodent on earth that was motion-magnified .
but it turns out that sound also produces visual motions .
it 's not something you 're used to seeing every day .
so that 's exactly what we did .
( applause ) i call it the visual microphone .
voice : mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , that lamb was sure to go .
( video ) voice : testing , testing , one two three .
testing , testing , one two three .
voice : mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
and if i want to control him , i can just drive .
so i 'll snap a picture .
thank you , scott .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see romo doing on the left .
and then if you have something you like , you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life , run the program in real life .
the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal .
so i wish that i could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like .
and in fact , my friend and ideo founder , david kelley , who’s out there somewhere , studied under him at stanford .
yup , yup , i think i probably am .
it takes more than decor , but i think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful , and that it’s a permissive environment .
don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos , but anyway , they’re there in the garden .
so all of these places have these symbols .
that’s great . if you could pass it up . thanks , david , i appreciate it .
but before we start , i need just to put these on .
i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage .
( laughter ) well , they’re still coming in from the back there ; they’re still coming in .
and there’s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
well , at least , we did once .
this is some aluminum foil , right ? you use it in the kitchen .
i wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different .
so that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things , even if they don’t seem that different from each other , is actually something that kids do well , and it is a form of play .
i mean , can you have rules about creativity ?
through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
and of course , they used experimentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics .
they were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device .
at ideo there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
instead of building play , this can be approached with role-play .
and i think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any flaws in your design , is to act it out .
so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this .
they can be a little skeptical ; i’ll come back to that .
`` if one kid plays `` '' store , '' '' and another one’s playing `` '' house , '' '' then the whole kind of play falls down . ''
so we’re very good , when acting out a solution , at spotting whether something lacks authenticity .
and so they grabbed some very simple materials , you can see , and did this role-play , this kind of very crude role-play , just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes .
well , imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub .
and so being able to move between those modes is really quite important . so , it’s where there’s a more nuanced version view of play , i think , is required .
thank you very much . ( applause )
this is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-trillion-a-year discontinuity in the global economy .
we worry about cocaine coming from the andean ridge north .
what should we do ?
we will need the application of military force .
this is afghanistan . these are afghan soldiers .
we 've taught well over 200,000 afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level .
when you can read and write in afghanistan , you will typically put a pen in your pocket .
this is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
in each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004 , 250,000 dead , the kashmiri earthquake in pakistan , 2005 , 85,000 dead , the haitian earthquake , about 300,000 dead , more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination which struck japan and its nuclear industry — in all of these instances , we see partnerships between international actors , interagency , private-public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster .
we tie it together , increasingly , by doing things like this .
white is the synthesis .
there was an article which was run by ap , on the wire .
the headline was : nato admiral needs friends .
wikipedia , every day , is tens of thousands of people inputting information , and every day millions of people withdrawing that information .
it 's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together .
my thesis for you is that by combining international , interagency , private-public , strategic communication , together , in this 21st century , we can create the sum of all security .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much . thank you . thank you . ( applause )
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
but when i went up on top , it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of manhattan with views of the empire state building and the statue of liberty and the hudson river .
last year we had about two million people , which is about 10 times what we ever estimated .
this is one of my favorite features in section one .
the bus was on fire , and many people were hurt and killed .
when i was 15 , i took an emt course , and i went to volunteer on an ambulance .
for two years , i volunteered on an ambulance in jerusalem .
he was on coumadin .
and this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time .
a few years after i started this organization , in a jewish community , two muslims from east jerusalem called me up .
it 's not about saving christians . it 's about saving people .
i never imagined that one day i 'd be speaking at tedmed .
forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
we just need a good idea , motivation and lots of chutzpah , and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved .
thank you very much .
you can — i can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there .
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we 'd like to do , but are so often unable , in the real world , to actually do those things — to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .
and so for me that was the thing that was so enticing .
i also think that more generally , the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend .
i think there 's a couple of things . it 's what we see in the movies — you know , it 's this dream that we all share .
in fact , second life virtual worlds are a lot like the internet in the early '90s today : everybody 's very excited , there 's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment , and then there 's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing 's not going to work .
the space itself is about 10 times the size of san francisco , and it 's about as densely built out .
it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility .
you know , mapping in india — that 's such a great example .
like for example , in the 19th century , any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian .
philip rosedale : i think that 's great . that 's such a deep question . yeah .
the answer is no , and i think the reason why is because the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up .
those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody , even if you mean well when you build them .
one of my favorites . i had this feature that i built into second life — i was really passionate about it .
i just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design .
and what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept , basically , was instantly and thoroughly ignored , and like , two months into the whole thing , — which is really a small amount of time , even in second life time — i remember the users , the people who were then using second life , the residents came to me and said , we want to buy the disco — because i had built it — we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it . and i sold it to them —
it does n't seem to have its own culture , and the sort of differences that exist in the real world are n't translated into the second life map .
i 'm still trying to find every noise that i can possibly make .
so there 's things you ca n't do , and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me , because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world , but they 're sketches at best , which is what 's annoyed me .
so i 've been working with these guys , and we 've made a machine .
we 've made a system which is basically a live production machine , a real-time music production machine , and it enables me to , using nothing but my voice , create music in real time as i hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me .
( organ sound ) and now i have that , i have that recorded .
there 's no samples . there 's no synthesizers .
but the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary .
i worked slowly , using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
there had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point .
it is clear to me that these two sets of pictures do n't make much sense without the other .
`` a huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shell of the trade union 's building and proclaims , `` '' glory to ukraine . ''
from the age of six on , i kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet .
and so , many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders , forage for berries , and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road .
in most of our minds , the vagabond is a creature from the past .
others come from the underbelly of society , never given a chance to mobilize upwards : foster care dropouts , teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes .
but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
addiction is real , the elements are real , freight trains maim and kill , and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence .
let 's just get started here .
( applause )
i think it 's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives .
what would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you ?
in tana toraja , the most important social moments in people 's lives , the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners , but funerals .
`` until the funeral ceremony , which can be held years after a person 's physical death , the deceased is referred to as `` '' to makala , '' '' a sick person , or `` '' to mama , '' '' a person who is asleep , and they continue to be a member of the household . ''
they are symbolically fed and cared for , and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions , which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as puya .
i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , does n't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there 's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased , and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who 's living to relating to the deceased as a person who 's an ancestor .
it 's a moment when people think about who they are , their place in society , and their role in the life cycle in accordance with torajan cosmology .
so at funerals , relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place : its impact on life and the relationships of the living .
so all of this focus on death does n't mean that torajans do n't aspire to the ideal of a long life .
and like a thread , it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end .
but i know that my husband 's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can ritually recount his life 's narrative , weaving his story into the history of their community .
his story is their story .
people ask me if i 'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn .
so i 'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans .
it could change the way that we die , but more importantly , it could transform the way that we live .
you 're at the threshold of the sistine chapel .
the human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story , a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the sistine chapel .
so , you may ask , how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year , from all different backgrounds ?
because in that compressed space , there was a creative explosion , ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers , which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history .
it reflected the rather parochial perspective .
with the addition of images of the pope 's friends and family , this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the european continent .
no more familiar artistic references to the world around you .
michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark , a churning figure blurry in the distance , compressed into a tight space .
so what 's he doing ?
but looking closer , that leg is pretty languid on the ground , the arm is heavy on the knee .
it puts us at the edge of our seats , because we 're one moment from that contact , through which that man will discover his purpose , leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation .
you have noah and his ark and the flood .
told in terms of the christian vision of the last judgment , the end of the world , michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies .
now , this does lead us to one odd thing .
but michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language , the most universal artistic language he could think of : that of the human body .
and so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery , he borrowed from julius ii 's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power .
am i one of the crowd ?
elizabeth lev : the effect of the last judgment was enormous .
el : grazie a te .
some other heroes can become invisible .
and it 's not science fiction . we have actually built it .
there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we 're going to bounce light off the door .
`` here are a few quotes indicating that : `` '' man has no nature , '' '' from the historian jose ortega y gasset ; `` '' man has no instincts , '' '' from the anthropologist ashley montagu ; `` '' the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none , '' '' from the late scientist stephen jay gould . ''
the anthropologist donald brown has tried to list them all , and they range from aesthetics , affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning , weapons , weather , attempts to control , the color white and a worldview .
by definition , two people picked at random ca n't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex .
now — the story might seem to good to be true , but when you administer batteries of psychological tests , you get the same results — namely , identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities .
for example , there 's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense , and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .
so even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed , that 's not the only thing in the skull , and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them .
`` `` '' do n't expect to get any more awards , job offers or positions in scholarly societies . '' '' `` `` tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio . '' '' `` do you have tenure ? '' ''
( laughter ) well , the book came out in october , and nothing terrible has happened .
my favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left-handers , and published some data showing that left-handers are , on average , more susceptible to disease , more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan .
none of the dire professional consequences has taken place — i have n't been exiled from the city of cambridge .
( laughter ) so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i 'll let you decide if whether they — the claims are really that outrageous .
well , in fact , the arts are not in decline .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
indeed , in movements of modernism and post-modernism , there was visual art without beauty , literature without narrative and plot , poetry without meter and rhyme , architecture and planning without ornament , human scale , green space and natural light , music without melody and rhythm , and criticism without clarity , attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition .
what a puzzle — i wonder why .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
and i 'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they 'll grow up smart .
`` and there are all kinds of play — clay for finger dexterity , word games for reading success , large motor play , small motor play . i feel like i could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids . '' '' i think anyone who 's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother . ''
until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid .
`` i have my own answer to that question , which comes from a great artist of the 19th century , anton chekhov , who said , `` '' man will become better when you show him what he is like . '' '' and i think that the argument ca n't be put any more eloquently than that . ''
