( arabic ) i seek refuge in allah from cursed satan . in the name of allah , the most gracious , the most merciful .
( english ) i was born in a middle class family .
my father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time i was born , he was already a businessman .
so i guess i was the lucky one .
my mother had 16 pregnancies .
from 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
you can imagine as a child what i went through .
day to day , i watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
at that time , when i finished my high school , i really wanted to be a doctor .
i wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
so i completed my education , but i wanted to go to university .
unfortunately , in my country , there was n't a dormitory for girls , so i was accepted in medical school , but i could not go there .
so as a result , my father sent me to america .
i came to america .
i completed my education .
while i was completing my education , my country was invaded by russia .
and do you know that at the time i was completing my education , i did n't know what was going on with my family or with my country .
there were months , years , i did n't know about it .
my family was in a refugee camp .
so as soon as i completed my education , i brought my family to america .
i wanted them to be safe .
but where was my heart ?
my heart was in afghanistan .
day after day , when i listened to the news , when i followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
i really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time i knew i could not go there , because there was no place for me .
i had a good job .
i was a professor at a university .
i earned good money .
i had a good life .
my family was here .
i could live with them .
but i was n't happy .
i wanted to go back home .
so i went to the refugee camp .
and when i went to the refugee camp in pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
about 90 percent of them were women and children . most of the men have been killed or they were in war . and you know , in the refugee camp ,
when i went day-to-day to do a survey , i found things you never could imagine .
i saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do .
i saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
i saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
so it was a very devastating situation .
my heart was beating for my people , and i did n't know what to do .
at that moment , we talk about momentum .
at that moment , i felt , what can i do for these people ?
how could i help these people ?
i am one individual . what can i do for them ?
but at that moment , i knew that education changed my life .
it transformed me . it gave me status .
it gave me confidence . it gave me a career .
it helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
and i knew that at that moment that what i should give to my people is education and health , and that 's what i went after .
but do you think it was easy ?
no , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
and also , by russia invading afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
`` it was very hard to come and say , `` '' i want to do this . '' '' who am i ? ''
somebody who comes from the united states .
somebody who got educated here .
did they trust me ? of course not .
so i really needed to build the trust in this community .
how am i going to do that ?
i went and surveyed and looked and looked .
i asked .
finally , i found one man .
he was 80 years old .
he was a mullah .
`` i went to his tent in the camp , and i asked him , `` i want to make you a teacher . '' ''
`` and he looked at me , and he said , `` '' crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think i can be a teacher ? '' '' and i told him , `` '' i will make you a teacher . '' '' finally , he accepted my offer , and once i started a class in his compound , the word spread all over . ''
in a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
( applause ) thank you . thank you .
but of course , we 're doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . we were training women 's rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . we were giving all kinds of training . and one day , i tell you ,
one day i was in the office in peshawar , pakistan .
`` all of a sudden , i saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , `` '' run away , hide ! '' '' and you know , as a leader , what do you do ? ''
you 're scared . you know it 's dangerous .
you know your life is on the line .
but as a leader , you have to hold it together .
you have to hold it together and show strength .
`` so i said , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' and these people were pouring into my office . ''
so i invited them to the office .
they came , and there were nine of them — nine taliban .
they were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
( laughter ) very mean-looking people , black clothes , black turban , and they pour into my office .
and i invited them to have a seat and have tea .
they said no . they are not going to drink tea .
and of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but i was really shaking up .
but also i was strong , holding myself up .
and , of course , by that time , you know how i dress — i dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
the only thing you could see , my eyes .
`` they asked me , `` '' what are you doing ? ''
do n't you know that school is banned for girls ?
`` what are you doing here ? '' '' and you know , i just looked at them , and i said , `` '' what school ? where is the school ? '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and they look at my face , and they said , `` '' you are teaching girls here . '' '' i said , `` '' this is a house of somebody . ''
we have some students coming , and they are all learning koran , holy book .
`` and you know , koran says that if you learn the holy book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . '' '' ( laughter ) and i tell you one thing : that 's the way you work with those people , and you know — ( laughter ) so by that time , they started speaking pashto . ''
`` they talked to each other , and they said , `` '' let 's go , leave her alone , she 's ok. '' '' and you know , this time , i offered them tea again , and they took a sip and they left . ''
by that time , my staff poured into my office .
they were scared to death .
they did n't know why they did n't kill me .
they did n't know why they did n't take me away .
but everybody was happy to see me .
very happy , and i was happy to be alive , of course .
( laughter ) of course , i was happy to be alive .
but also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the taliban — of course during the taliban there is another story .
we went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
with the fall of the taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
we opened women 's learning center .
we continuously opened clinics .
we worked with mothers and children .
we had reproductive health training .
we had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
i was very happy . i was delighted with the outcome of my work .
and one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , i was going up north of kabul , and all of a sudden , again , i was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
rifles on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
`` and i told my driver , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' and the driver said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' he asked them . they said , `` '' we have nothing to do with you . '' '' they called my name . they said , `` '' we want her . '' '' my bodyguard got out , said , `` '' i can answer you . ''
`` what do you want ? '' '' they said , `` '' nothing . '' '' they called my name . ''
and by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
i am very shaken up , and i told myself , this is it .
this time , we all are going to be killed .
there is no doubt in my mind .
but still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
it 's in your heart .
you believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
so i just hold myself on the side of the car .
my leg was shaking , and i got outside .
`` and i asked them , `` '' what can i do for you ? '' '' you know what they said to me ? ''
`` they said , `` '' we know who you are . ''
we know where you are going .
every day you go up north here and there .
you train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
`` you build their skills . how about us ? '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) `` '' and you know , how about us ? ''
`` what are we going to do ? '' '' i looked at them , and i said , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' ( laughter ) they said , `` '' it 's ok . ''
the only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we 're born , we just hold the gun and kill .
`` that 's all we know . '' '' and you know what that means . ''
it 's a trap to me , of course .
`` so i walk out of there . they said , `` '' we 'll let you go , go . '' '' and so i walked into the car , i sit in the car , and i told the driver , `` '' turn around and go back to the office . '' '' at that time , we only were supporting girls . ''
we only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
by the time i came to the office , of course my trainers were gone .
they ran away home . nobody stayed there .
my bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
`` i was shaken up , and i sat on my table , and i said , `` '' what am i going to do ? '' '' how am i going to solve this problem ? ''
because we had training going on up north already .
hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
so i was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
`` and she asked me , `` '' sakena ? '' '' and i answered her . ''
`` she said , `` '' it 's not you . what 's wrong with you ? '' '' i said , `` '' nothing . '' '' i tried to cover . ''
no matter what i tried to do , she did n't believe me , and she asked me again .
`` `` ok , tell me what 's going on ? '' ''
i told her the whole story .
`` at that time , she said , `` '' ok , you go next time , and you will help them . ''
`` you will help them . '' '' and when , two days later , i went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car . ''
so we stopped the car .
`` i got out . i said , `` '' ok , let 's go with me . '' '' and they said , `` '' yes . '' '' i said , `` '' on one condition , that whatever i say , you accept it . '' '' and they said , yes , they do . ''
so i took them to the mosque , and to make a long story short , i told them i 'd give them teachers .
today , they are the best trainers .
they learn english , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . they are ahead , and we go .
and they protect us .
and — ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
that tells you that education transforms people .
when you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
we can not only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
( laughter ) so we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
so we are continuously giving training to men , and i really believe strongly .
i live in a country that was a beautiful country .
i just want to share this with you .
it was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
we were going everywhere .
women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
we never locked our doors .
but you know what happened to my country .
today , people can not walk out of their door without security issues .
but we want the same afghanistan we had before .
and i want to tell you the other side .
today , the women of afghanistan are working very , very hard .
they are earning degrees . they are training to be lawyers .
they are training to be doctors , back again .
they are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
so it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
i want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
if you have these few things with you , you will accomplish .
we have one poet , mawlānā rūmī .
he said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
and i tell you , we could .
and if we could do it in afghanistan , i am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
thank you very , very much .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause )
ten years ago , i got a phone call that changed my life .
at the time , i was cardiologist at ucla , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo .
an elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she 'd had a stroke .
now , to be clear , north american zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
and this procedure , which i have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
and occasionally , on the very same day , i went on rounds at ucla medical center and at the los angeles zoo .
and here 's what started coming into very clear focus for me .
physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : congestive heart failure , brain tumors , leukemia , diabetes , arthritis , als , breast cancer , even psychiatric syndromes like depression , anxiety , compulsions , eating disorders and self-injury .
now , i 've got a confession to make .
even though i studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad — i had even written my senior thesis on darwinian theory — learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wake-up call for me .
so i started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that i had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
for that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
i mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
every medication that we prescribe or that we 've taken ourselves or we 've given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
but there 's something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
you know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
well , today 's human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
and this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
but i think there 's an even deeper reason .
physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
but in our hearts , we do n't completely believe that .
i feel it myself when i 'm listening to mozart or looking at pictures of the mars rover on my macbook .
i feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as i recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
well , i 'm trying these days .
when i see a human patient now , i always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that i do n't know ?
and , might i be taking better care of my human patient if i saw them as a human animal patient ?
here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
fear-induced heart failure .
it was described in a gambling father who had lost his life 's savings with a roll of the dice , in a bride who 'd been left at the alter .
`` but it turns out , this `` '' new '' '' human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human . ''
veterinarians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos , from to deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
how many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of e.r . docs and cardiologists ?
self-injury .
some human patients harm themselves .
some animal patients also harm themselves .
there are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
but veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals .
should n't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury ?
postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
they may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
equine veterinarians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the foal , refusing to nurse , and in some instances , kick the foal , even to death .
but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
oxytocin is the bonding hormone , and this leads to renewed interest , on the part of the mare , in her foal .
should n't this information be put into the hands of ob/gyn 's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis ?
well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
to explain it , i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to air some dirty laundry .
some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not m.d . 's .
i 'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
of course , most physicians do n't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , homo sapiens , but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amphibians , reptiles , fish and birds .
so i do n't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession 's condescension and ignorance .
but here 's one from the vets : what do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
a physician . ( laughter ) closing the gap has become a passion for me , and i 'm doing this through programs like darwin on rounds at ucla , where we 're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents .
and through zoobiquity conferences , where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
at zoobiquity conferences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher ; how understanding polycystic overies in a holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-strung sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school .
in the united states and now internationally , at zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
because it turns out , some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients are n't human .
and one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
thank you .
( applause ) .
is n't it nice ?
`` ( laughter ) the key phrase is `` '' was , '' '' phew . ''
i knew nothing about cancer .
your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
you suddenly become a disease on legs .
doctors start speaking a language which you do n't understand .
they start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
people start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
`` they say , `` '' what did the doctor say ? '' '' before even saying , `` '' hello . '' '' and in the meanwhile , you 're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer . ''
`` these are the `` '' can i ? '' '' questions : can i work while i have cancer ? ''
can i study ? can i make love ? can i be creative ?
`` and you wonder , `` '' what have i done to deserve this ? '' '' you wonder , `` '' can i change something about my lifestyle ? '' '' you wonder , `` '' can i do something ? ''
`` are there any other options ? '' '' and , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you . ''
`` but they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so i 'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — `` patient '' means `` the one who waits . '' ''
( laughter ) things are changing , but classically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you 're going through .
but instead , you 're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
it was really hard to obtain , because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
`` i talked to it and i said , `` '' okay , cancer , you 're not all there is to me . ''
there 's more to me .
`` a cure , whichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . '' '' and so , the next day , i left the hospital against medical advice . ''
i was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and i was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery .
i 'm an artist , i use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
so my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone .
i actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
`` ( laughter ) i chose this word , la cura — la cura in italian means `` '' the cure '' '' — because in many different cultures , the word `` '' cure '' '' can mean many different things . ''
in our western cultures , it means eradicating or reversing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from asia , from the mediterranean , from latin countries , from africa , it can mean many more things .
of course , i was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but i was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
i was interested in the social cure , i was interested in the psychological cure , i was interested in the spiritual cure , i was interested in the emotional cure , i was interested in any form of cure .
and , it worked .
the la cura website went viral .
i received lots of media attention from italy and from abroad and i quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails , social networking — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
for example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for la cura .
for example , here we see francesca fini in her performance .
or , as artist patrick lichty has done : he produced a 3d sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on thingiverse .
now you can have my cancer , too !
( laughter ) which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
and this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
with all this information and support , i was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , oncologists , and several hundred volunteers with whom i was able to discuss the information i was receiving , which is very important .
and together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
so i was able to take my time and choose .
i chose the doctor i wanted to work with , i chose the hospital i wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , i was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of la cura .
what are the outcomes ?
i 'm fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
`` ( applause ) i had excellent news after the surgery — i have — i had a very low-grade glioma , which is a `` '' good '' '' kind of cancer which does n't grow a lot . ''
i have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
and right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks i was running into and if there were any i wanted to avoid .
obviously , there were .
thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
doctors got to talk with people they do n't usually consult when they think about cancer .
i 'm a self-founding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
[ society ] the most important thing of la cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components .
this global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
( applause ) .
okay , i have no idea what we 're going to play .
i wo n't be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
i did n't realize there was going to be a little music before .
so i think i 'm going to start with what i just heard .
( music ) ( applause ) okay , so first of all , let 's welcome mr. jamire williams on the drums , ( applause ) burniss travis on the bass , ( applause ) and mr. christian sands on the piano . ( applause )
so the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
it is really a sacred space .
and one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
you really are alive right here in this moment .
there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
we had no idea what key we were going to play in .
`` in the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called `` '' titi boom . '' '' but that could have happened — maybe , maybe not . ''
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
you have no time for projected ideas .
so the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it 's easier to talk about someone else 's mistake .
so the way i perceive a mistake when i 'm on the bandstand — first of all , we do n't really see it as a mistake .
the only mistake lies in that i 'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
`` every `` '' mistake '' '' is an opportunity in jazz . ''
so it 's hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
so for example , if i played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
( music ) so if christian played a note — like play an f. ( music )
see , these are all right inside of the color palette .
if you played an e .
see , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
if you played an f # though , ( dissonance ) to most people 's ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
so i 'm going to show you , we 're going to play just for a second .
and we 're going to play on this palette .
and at some point , christian will introduce this note .
and we wo n't react to it .
he 'll introduce it for a second and then i 'll stop , i 'll talk for a second .
we 'll see what happens when we play with this palette .
( music ) so someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we did n't react to it .
it was an opportunity that was missed .
so it 's unpredictable . we 'll paint this palette again .
he 'll play it . i do n't know how we 'll react to it , but something will change .
we 'll all accept his ideas , or not .
( music ) so you see , he played this note .
i ended up creating a melody out of it .
the texture changed in the drums this time .
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it .
so there is no mistake .
the only mistake is if i 'm not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we do n't allow for creativity .
so jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
it 's a very purifying experience .
and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we do n't take it for granted .
we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
so how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
well we 're jazz musicians , so stereotypically we do n't have a great relationship to finance .
( laughter ) anyway , i just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
and the other dynamic of it is that we do n't micromanage in jazz .
you have some people who do .
but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
if i come up and i dictate to the band that i want to play like this and i want the music to go this way , and i just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
one , two , one , two , three , four .
( music ) it 's kind of chaotic because i 'm bullying my ideas .
`` i 'm telling them , `` '' you come with me over this way . '' '' if i really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen . ''
this is a science of listening .
it has far more to do with what i can perceive than what it is that i can do .
so if i want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what 's going on and pull from something that 's going on around me .
when you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
watch . one , two , a one , two , three , four .
( music ) totally different experience when i 'm pulling ideas .
it 's much more organic . it 's much more nuanced .
it 's not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
it 's about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
thank you .
( applause )
( applause ) one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
but , you see , there are things we 're enthralled to in education .
this one teacher did n't take it seriously .
i want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
so most everyone watches tv .
we like it . we like some parts of it .
here in america , people actually love tv .
the average american watches tv for almost 5 hours a day .
okay ?
now i happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that 's a good thing .
but a lot of people do n't love it so much .
they , in fact , berate it .
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
`` my mother , growing up , she called it the `` '' idiot box . '' '' but my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good tv or bad tv ; my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a conscience . ''
so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
so all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
now today , we 're not talking about good and bad tv .
we 're talking about popular tv .
we 're talking about top-10 nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
how does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
you have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
as humans , what 's important to remember is that we 've developed , we 've evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
we have the capacity to laugh and cry .
we feel awe , we feel pity .
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
we love to watch tv .
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
animals might love to play , but they do n't love to watch .
so i had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
so to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
we went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season .
we surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
we talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
how did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
did you feel outrage ? did you laugh ?
what did this mean for you ?
so to our global ted audiences , i want to say that this was a u.s. sample .
but as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
and on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the u.s. 's most popular shows are exported around the world .
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .
two acknowledgments before our first data slide : for inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , i thank legendary rabbi , jack stern .
and for the way in which i 'm going to present the data , i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling , who you may have just seen .
okay , here we go .
so here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
two things we 're going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which i do n't understand the difference between right and wrong .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
that 's what we 're watching tv for .
moral ambiguity starts to climb .
right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
why ?
the cuban missile crisis , jfk is shot , the civil rights movement , race riots , the vietnam war , mlk is shot , bobby kennedy is shot , watergate .
look what happens .
in 1970 , inspiration plummets .
moral ambiguity takes off .
they cross , but ronald reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
it 's trying to recover .
but look , it ca n't : aids , iran-contra , the challenger disaster , chernobyl .
moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
take a look at this .
this chart is going to document a very similar trend .
but in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
`` now this time on tv you have `` '' bonanza , '' '' do n't forget , you have `` '' gunsmoke , '' '' you have `` '' andy griffith , '' '' you have domestic shows all about comfort . ''
this is rising . comfort stays whole .
irreverence starts to rise .
social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
you get to 1969 , and look what happens .
`` you have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — `` '' gunsmoke '' '' and `` '' gomer pyle '' '' — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows . ''
what 's number one ?
`` the socially irreverent hippie show , `` rowan and martin 's laugh-in . '' ''
they 're all living together , right .
viewers had responded dramatically .
look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
when you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
`` it means in the 1966 television season , the `` '' smothers brothers '' '' came out of nowhere . ''
`` this was the first show that allowed viewers to say , `` '' my god , i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war , about the presidency , through television ? '' '' that 's what we mean by a breakout show . ''
so then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
in 1970 , the dam bursts . the dam bursts .
comfort is no longer why we watch television .
social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
now look at this .
the 70s means who ? norman lear .
`` you have `` '' all in the family , '' '' `` '' sanford and son , '' '' and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — `` mas*h . '' ''
in the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the vietnam war , five of the top-10 during the nixon administration .
only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , wow ! tv can do that ?
it can make me feel this ?
it can change us ?
so to this very , very savvy crowd , i also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
`` this is a quick chart . here 's another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , `` takes me out of my everyday realm '' and `` '' makes me feel better . '' '' that 's mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic . ''
you 'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
`` no . in the 70s you have the bellwether show `` '' the bionic woman '' '' that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the `` '' six million-dollar man '' '' and `` '' charlie 's angels . '' '' another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power . ''
what were those shows ?
glamorous and rich .
`` `` dallas , '' `` fantasy island . '' ''
incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
so here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
whether or not you 're in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality tv .
well , as we say in the business , x marks the spot .
`` the 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we 're watching `` '' friends , '' '' `` '' frasier , '' '' `` '' cheers '' '' and `` '' seinfeld . '' '' everything 's good , low unemployment . ''
but look : x marks the spot .
in 2001 , the september 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
why not ?
we had a 2000 presidential election decided by the supreme court .
we had the bursting of the tech bubble .
we had 9/11 .
anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
look what happens when we keep going .
at the turn of the century , the internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
what do people want in their tv then ?
i would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
no , they want judgment .
i can vote you off the island .
i can keep sarah palin 's daughter dancing .
i can choose the next american idol . you 're fired .
that 's all great , right ?
so as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did i start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
we 're animals , we need our moms .
there has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant tv mom .
`` the 1950s : june cleever in the original comfort show , `` '' leave it to beaver . '' '' lucille ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s . ''
maude findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on tv .
the 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington .
murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
this era 's mom , bree van de kamp .
now i do n't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television 's shoulders , but i do know that i absolutely love this image .
so to you all , the women of tedwomen , the men of tedwomen , the global audiences of tedwomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
but let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
they give it life on television , for sure , but it 's you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
so thanks very much .

in 1994 , i walked into a prison in cambodia , and i met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
and as i looked into his eyes , i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political prisoners , that i would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
he was not a political prisoner .
he was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
it is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it 's cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
first is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
the second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
and the third is commitment .
so in the year 2000 , i began to wonder , what if we came together ?
could we do something for these 93 countries ?
and i founded international bridges to justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
my first experiences , though , did come from cambodia , and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the khmer rouge had killed them all .
`` and even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you 'd meet women and you 'd say , `` '' why are you here ? '' '' women would say , `` '' well i 've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they ca n't find him . '' '' so it 's just a place where there was no rule of law . ''
`` the first group of defenders came together and i still remember , as i was training , i said , `` okay , what do you do for an investigation ? '' ''
`` and there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , [ inaudible name ] , and she said `` '' khrew , '' '' which means `` '' teacher . '' '' she said , `` '' i have defended more than a hundred people , and i 've never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . '' '' and we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law . ''
and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
`` and i still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , `` '' no , no , no , no , we 're going to do things the exact same way we 've been doing them . '' '' but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house . ''
she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
she was pregnant at the time . she had cigarette burns on her . she 'd miscarried .
`` and when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , `` '' yes , there 's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . '' '' and the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia . ''
but cambodia is not alone .
i used to think , well is it cambodia ?
or is it other countries ?
but it is in so many countries .
in burundi i walked into a prison and it was n't a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
`` or a woman , i picked up her baby , really cute baby , i said `` '' your baby is so cute . '' '' it was n't a baby , she was three . ''
`` and she said `` '' yeah , but she 's why i 'm here , '' '' because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison . ''
`` and when i walked up to the prison director , i said , `` '' you 've got to let her out . ''
`` a judge would let her out . '' '' and he said , `` '' okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . what can we do ? '' '' so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases . ''
but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
`` for example , in cambodia , it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . and in the same way , in china , they always tell me , `` '' it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . '' '' or in zimbabwe , where i remember innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , `` '' i 've been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , '' '' he came and we had a training together and he said , `` '' i have heard it said '' '' — because he had heard people mumbling ''
`` and grumbling — `` '' i have heard it said that we can not help to create justice because we do not have the resources . '' '' and then he said , `` '' but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . '' '' and with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases . ''
the key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
`` i was recently in egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , `` '' hey , look , we do n't have police on the streets now . the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . they were torturing everybody all the time . '' '' and i said , `` '' but there 's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here . ''
`` what 's going on ? '' '' i met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders . ''
and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
`` i said , `` '' i 'm gon na copy this . '' '' it had everything in it . lawyers can come at the police station . it was perfect . ''
prosecutors were perfectly trained .
`` but i said to them , `` '' i just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office , what had happened to them ? '' '' and after a pause , they said , `` they had been tortured . '' ''
so the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
`` and as i tell you this , i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like , `` '' oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? '' '' because it sounds big . ''
and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible .
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
it 's not only innocent , who i told you about in zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
we have a program called justicemakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
and there are 30 justicemakers throughout the world , from sri lanka to swaziland to the drc , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through sms programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
and it 's not only these justicemakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
so in china , for instance , great laws came out where it says police can not torture people or they will be punished .
`` and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , `` '' how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is implemented ? ''
`` this is fantastic . '' '' and he said to me , `` '' well , do you have money ? '' '' and i said , `` '' no . '' '' and he said , `` '' that 's okay , we can still figure it out . '' '' and on december 4 , he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights . ''
so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
we need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
`` and people often say to me , `` '' you know , this is great , but it 's wildly idealistic . ''
`` never going to happen . '' '' and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid . ''
it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
`` now , there 's one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : `` '' take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . '' '' and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool . ''
`` i end always , because i 'm sure the questions are — and i 'd be happy to talk to you at any point — `` '' but what can i really do ? '' '' well , i would say this . first of all , you know what you can do . but second of all , i would leave you with the story of vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting international bridges to justice . ''
vishna was a 4-year-old boy when i met him who was born in a cambodian prison in kandal province . but because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
so , you know , there 's bars . and by the time that vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? your head gets bigger .
so he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . and he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
you know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . and i would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . and i was like , here 's vishna . he 's a 4-year-old boy .
`` he was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which i believe we are all born into . he said , `` '' probably i ca n't do everything . ''
but i 'm one . i can do something .
`` and i will do the one thing that i can do . '' '' so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us . ''
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
`` some people think that there 's a ted talk formula : `` give a talk on a round , red rug . '' ''
`` `` share a childhood story . '' ''
`` `` divulge a personal secret . '' ''
`` `` end with an inspiring call to action . '' ''
no .
that 's not how to think of a ted talk .
in fact , if you overuse those devices , you 're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
i 've helped them prepare their talks for prime time , and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk .
and even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different , they actually do have one key common ingredient .
and it 's this : your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners ' minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
let me show you what i mean .
here 's haley .
she is about to give a ted talk and frankly , she 's terrified .
( video ) presenter : haley van dyck !
they 're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns .
and i do n't just mean they 're feeling the same emotions .
let 's take a look inside haley 's brain for a moment .
there are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
but look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
that 's right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
but wait — what is an idea anyway ?
well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
here are just a few examples shared from the ted stage .
sir ken robinson — creativity is key to our kids ' future .
chris anderson : elora hardy — building from bamboo is beautiful .
( video ) elora hardy : it is growing all around us , it 's strong , it 's elegant , it 's earthquake-resistant .
ca : chimamanda adichie — people are more than a single identity .
( video ) chimamanda adichie : the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
ca : your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
they 're carefully linked together .
collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
it 's your brain 's operating system .
it 's how you navigate the world .
and it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
so , for example , if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable , then when you see this , you 'll react like this .
but if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous , then when you see this , you 'll react a little bit differently .
so , it 's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
you need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
now , different people 's worldviews can be dramatically different .
for example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( video ) dalia mogahed : what do you think when you look at me ?
`` `` '' a woman of faith , '' '' `` '' an expert , '' '' maybe even `` '' a sister '' '' ? ''
`` or `` '' oppressed , '' '' `` '' brainwashed , '' '' `` '' a terrorist '' '' ? ''
ca : whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
if communicated properly , they 're capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shaping their actions both now and well into the future .
ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
so if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience , here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task : one , limit your talk to just one major idea .
ideas are complex things ; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you 're most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
you have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
so pick one idea , and make it the through-line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
two , give your listeners a reason to care .
before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
and the main tool to achieve that ?
curiosity .
stir your audience 's curiosity .
use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something does n't make sense and needs explaining .
if you can reveal a disconnection in someone 's worldview , they 'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
and once you 've sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
you use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners ' minds — but not your language , their language .
you start where they are .
the speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences .
now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
`` for example , when jennifer kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called crispr , she said , `` '' it 's as if , for the first time , you had a word processor to edit dna . ''
`` crispr allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . '' '' now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds . ''
it 's important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
four , here 's the final tip : make your idea worth sharing .
`` by that i mean , ask yourself the question : `` who does this idea benefit ? '' ''
and i need you to be honest with the answer .
if the idea only serves you or your organization , then , i 'm sorry to say , it 's probably not worth sharing .
the audience will see right through you .
but if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else 's day or change someone else 's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
we retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
it 's about enjoying mundane sounds .
this , for example , is my tumble dryer .
now sound is my passion , it 's my life .
`` so , imagine you 're standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , `` excuse me , what is the name of this block ? '' ''
`` and you say , `` '' i 'm sorry , well , this is oak street , that 's elm street . ''
`` this is 26th , that 's 27th . '' '' he says , `` '' ok , but what is the name of that block ? '' '' you say , `` '' well , blocks do n't have names . ''
`` streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . '' '' he leaves , a little confused and disappointed . ''
`` so , now imagine you 're standing on a street , anywhere in japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , `` excuse me , what is the name of this street ? '' ''
`` they say , `` '' oh , well that 's block 17 and this is block 16 . '' '' and you say , `` '' ok , but what is the name of this street ? '' '' and they say , `` '' well , streets do n't have names . ''
blocks have names .
just look at google maps here . there 's block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
all of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
`` and you say then , `` '' ok , then how do you know your home address ? '' '' he said , `` '' well , easy , this is district eight . ''
`` there 's block 17 , house number one . '' '' you say , `` '' ok , but walking around the neighborhood , i noticed that the house numbers do n't go in order . '' '' he says , `` '' of course they do . they go in the order in which they were built . ''
the first house ever built on a block is house number one .
the second house ever built is house number two .
