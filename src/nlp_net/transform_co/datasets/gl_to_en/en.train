just to put everything in context , and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from , so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say , and the things i 'm going to do — or things i 'm going to tell you i 've done — you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to be where i am .
and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad , we went back home .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's 13-year-old car — and i was a paid doctor .
this brings us to why a lot of us , who are professionals , are now , as they say , in diaspora .
now , are we going to make that a permanent thing , where we all get trained , and we leave , and we do n't go back ?
perhaps not , i should certainly hope not — because that is not my vision .
all right , for good measure , that 's where nigeria is on the african map , and just there is the delta region that i 'm sure everybody 's heard of .
people getting kidnapped , where the oil comes from , the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria .
very interesting .
how many people do you think are on that taxi ?
and believe it or not , that is a taxi in nigeria .
and the capital — well , what used to be the capital of nigeria — lagos , that 's a taxi , and you have police on them .
so , tell me , how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ? and now ? three .
so , when these kind of people — and , believe me , it 's not just the police that use these taxis in lagos . we all do . i 've been on one of these , and i did n't have a helmet , either .
and it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off , has an accident and needs a hospital .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive aids .
and she 's right . every time you go there , you know that if you actually need critical care — critical care of any sort — if you have an accident — of which there are many , there are accidents everywhere — where do they go ?
where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ?
i 'm not saying instead of , i 'm saying as well as , aids , tb , malaria , typhoid — the list goes on .
i 'm saying , where do they go when they 're like me ?
when i go back home — and i do all kinds of things , i teach , i train — but i catch one of these things , or i 'm chronically ill with one of those , where do they go ?
what 's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled ?
i think it 's quite significant . this is where they go .
these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden — this is a major hospital . in fact , it 's from a major teaching hospital in nigeria .
now that is less than a year old , in an operating room .
that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria .
you remember all that oil ?
yes , i 'm sorry if it upsets some of you , but i think you need to see this . that 's the floor , ok ?
you can say some of this is education .
i 'm saying we need more than just , you know , vaccination , malaria , aids , because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there .
and that 's my specialty , right ?
anesthesiology and critical care — look at that bag .
it 's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.k .
and believe me , these are current pictures .
now , if something like this , which has happened in the u.k. , that 's where they go . this is the intensive care unit in which i work .
`` all right , this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria , and jokingly we refer to it as `` '' expensive scare . '' '' because it 's scary and it 's expensive , but we need to have it , ok ? ''
so , these are the problems .
there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are , are there ?
i think we all know . and several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems .
these are a few of them . so , what did i do ?
there we go — we 're going on a mission .
just so you know , i do believe in missions , i do believe in aid and i do believe in charity . they have their place , but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier ?
because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission .
health is wealth , in the words of hans rosling .
you get wealthier faster if you are healthy first .
so , here we are , mission . big trouble .
open-heart surgery in nigeria — big trouble .
that 's mike , mike comes out from mississippi .
does he look like he 's happy ?
it took us two days just to organize the place , but hey , you know , we worked on it . does he look happy ?
yes , let 's just go work this thing out .
see , that 's one of the problems we have in nigeria and in africa generally .
we get a lot of donated equipment .
equipment that 's obsolete , equipment that does n't quite work , or it works and you ca n't fix it . and there 's nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
but we had problems with it . we had severe problems there .
he had to get on the phone . this guy was always on the phone .
so what we going to do now ?
the reason i have this picture here , this x-ray , it 's just to tell you where and how we were viewing x-rays .
do you figure where that is ? it was on a window .
i mean , what 's an x-ray viewing box ? please .
well , nowadays everything 's on pax anyway .
you look at your x-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them , you email them . but we were still using x-rays , but we did n't even have a viewing box !
people still believe in voodoo . heart disease , vsd , hole in the heart , tetralogies .
you still get people who believe in it and they came .
at 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 .
her condition , open-heart surgery that as she required , would have been treated when she was a child .
we had to do these for adults . so , we did succeed and we still do .
we 've done three . we 're planning another one in july in the north of the country . so , we certainly still do open-heart , but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in — we ship everything , instruments . we had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who were n't used to it .
the oxygen tanks did n't quite work right .
but how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
this is what i mean about appropriate technology .
that 's what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply did n't work .
have you seen one of those before ?
no ? yes ? does n't matter , it worked .
this one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing .
`` so , we put my hand in my pocket and say , `` '' guys , let 's just buy stuff . ''
`` let 's go set up a company that teaches people , educates them , gives them the tools they need to keep going . '' '' and that 's a perfect example of one . ''
if you 're in america and you do n't know about this one , we do , because we make it our duty to find out what 's appropriate technology for africa — what 's appropriately priced , does the job , and we move on . anesthesia machine : multi-parameter monitor , operating lights , suction .
this little unit here — remember your little 12-volt plug in the car , that charges your , whatever , game boy , telephone ?
that 's exactly how the outlets are designed .
yes , it will take a solar panel . yes a solar panel will charge it .
but if you 've got mains as well , it will charge the batteries in there .
and guess what ? we have a little pedal charger too , just in case .
and guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . then you can customize it .
is it dental surgery you want ? general surgery you want ?
decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
and currently we 're working on oxygen — oxygen delivery on-site .
if you take nitrogen out , what 's left ? oxygen , pretty much .
so that 's not new . what we 're doing is applying this technology to it .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
this is what makes it so special .
apart from the awards it 's won , it 's portable and it 's certified . it 's registered , the mhra — and the ce mark , for those who do n't know , for europe , is the equivalent of the fda in the u.s .
if you compare it with what 's on the market , price-wise , size-wise , ease of use , complexity ...
this picture was taken last year .
these are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
it was in this gentleman 's house in the potomac , for those of you who are familiar with maryland .
there are too many of us outside and everybody , just to borrow a bit from hans — hans rosling , he 's my guy — if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention , it 's the problems . but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa — looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they 've got .
african people , because they will do it with a passion , i hope .
and lots and lots of that little bit down there , sacrifice .
you have to do it . africans have to do it , in conjunction with everyone else .
thank you .
you might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
and it does , does n't it ?
i was clapping . they were clapping .
thank you , thank you .
we see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . we 've lived with them all our lives .
but there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
they do n't seem to be of our creation .
they do n't seem to be under our control .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations , and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer 's .
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie , the old lady .
i went in to see her .
it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence , but she 'd been very startled and very bewildered , because she 'd been seeing things .
and she told me — the nurses had n't mentioned this — that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
but now , for the last few days , she 'd been seeing things .
`` so i said , `` '' what sort of things ? '' '' and she said , `` '' people in eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs . ''
a man who turns towards me and smiles .
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
animals too .
i see a white building . it 's snowing , a soft snow .
i see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
then , one night , the scene changes .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .
they come to a certain point and then stop .
then it changes again .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
`` they wear bright colors , rose and blue , like eastern dress . '' '' sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling . ''
`` i said , `` '' is this like a dream ? '' '' and she said , `` '' no , it 's not like a dream . it 's like a movie . '' '' she said , `` '' it 's got color . it 's got motion . ''
`` she said , `` '' all these people with eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . '' '' ( laughter ) and she has a sense of humor . ''
she knew it was a hallucination .
but she was frightened . she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before .
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
she had no control over them .
she said she did n't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
and she did n't know what was going on .
she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
well , i examined her carefully .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
she was n't on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
but she was blind .
`` and i then said to her , `` i think i know what you have . '' ''
`` i said , `` '' there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness . ''
`` this was originally described , '' '' i said , `` '' right back in the 18th century , by a man called charles bonnet . ''
and you have charles bonnet syndrome .
`` she said , `` '' who is this charles bonnet ? '' '' she said , `` '' did he have them himself ? '' '' and she said , `` '' tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . '' '' ( laughter ) `` i 'm not crazy . i 'm not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . '' ''
well , so i did tell the nurses .
now this , for me , is a common situation .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
you do n't have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
now with the original description in the 18th century , charles bonnet did not have them .
his grandfather had these hallucinations .
his grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
he 'd had cataract surgery .
his vision was pretty poor .
and in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
and he knew it was a hallucination .
you do n't have handkerchiefs in midair .
and then he saw a big wheel in midair .
but sometimes he was n't sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
`` so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , `` '' and who are these handsome young men with you ? '' '' and they said , `` '' alas , grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . '' '' and then the handsome young men disappeared . ''
it 's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
they do n't usually fade in and out .
they are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
charles lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
on one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
that was the only figure he recognized .
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris , he saw — this was real — a scaffolding .
but when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
`` with him and with rosalie , what seems to be going on — and rosalie said , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' — and i said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously . ''
and you start to see things .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
with another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
on one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
she had very mobile hallucinations as well .
a lot of them had to do with a car .
sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
this was a woman who did n't have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and , above all , she would see cartoons .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog .
`` ( laughter ) now , i do n't watch sesame street , but she made a point of saying , `` '' why kermit ? '' '' she said , `` '' kermit the frog means nothing to me . ''
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
why kermit ?
and these frightened her .
well , what is going on with these people ?
as a physician , i have to try and define what 's going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these .
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
in particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you 're going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . they accuse you .
they seduce you . they humiliate you .
they jeer at you .
you interact with them .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is a film . you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that 's how people think about it .
there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
you smell chestnuts roasting .
you hear the traffic . all the senses are involved .
and you 're waiting for your girl .
and it 's that tuesday evening back in 1982 .
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations — the pink and blue squares the woman had — up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
and one of the second commonest is cartoons .
so , what is going on ?
fascinatingly , in the last few years , it 's been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating .
and in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
you do n't form images with your primary visual cortex .
when images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
and in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
it 's very interesting that that should be specific .
around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
`` `` '' face cells '' '' were discovered around 1970 . ''
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
`` so you may not only have `` '' car '' '' cells , you may have `` '' aston martin '' '' cells . ''
( laughter ) i saw an aston martin this morning .
i had to bring it in .
and now it 's in there somewhere .
( laughter ) now , at this level , in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
it 's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
and in the charles bonnet syndrome , you do n't go to those higher levels .
you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
and instead of getting normal perception , you 're getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
so , suddenly you see a face . suddenly you see a car .
suddenly this , and suddenly that .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
`` but in fact people say , `` i do n't recognize the people . i ca n't form any associations . '' ''
`` `` kermit means nothing to me . '' ''
you do n't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
well , i 've more or less said what i wanted .
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
think of the number of blind people .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
charles bonnet said , 250 years ago — he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
now , 250 years later , i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done .
thanks very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : that was superb . thank you so much .
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
oliver sacks : i was afraid you 'd ask that .
( laughter ) well , yeah , a lot of them .
and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself .
i 'm blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
and i see the geometrical hallucinations .
but they stop there .
ca : and they do n't disturb you ?
os : well they do n't disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which i ignore .
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
i 've gone and had an fmri myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migraine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
thank you so much for sharing .
os : thank you . thank you .

showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies , but was paired with this righteous , deeply inspired attorney named jeff purcell , who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day .
and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low-income families in boston who would come in presenting with housing issues , but always had an underlying health issue .
so i had a client who came in , about to be evicted because he has n't paid his rent .
but he has n't paid his rent , of course , because he 's paying for his hiv medication and just ca n't afford both .
we had moms who would come in , daughter has asthma , wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning .
and i would collect the cockroaches , hot glue-gun them to this poster board that we 'd bring to court for our cases .
and we always won because the judges were just so grossed out .
far more effective , i have to say , than anything i later learned in law school .
and at the end of my freshman year of college , i read an article about the work that dr. barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center .
and his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients .
so i called barry , and with his blessing , in october 1995 walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center .
i 'll never forget , the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons .
and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two , three , sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable .
`` they said , `` '' every day we have patients that come into the clinic — child has an ear infection , i prescribe antibiotics . ''
but the real issue is there 's no food at home .
the real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment .
and i do n't even ask about those issues because there 's nothing i can do .
i have 13 minutes with each patient .
patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room .
i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is .
`` and i do n't even have any help . '' '' in that clinic , even today , there are two social workers for 24,000 pediatric patients , which is better than a lot of the clinics out there . ''
so health leads was born of these conversations — a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food , heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication .
patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources .
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy .
so 18 months ago i got this email that changed my life .
in 1965 dr. geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country , in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta .
and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them .
and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket , which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic .
`` and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care — to which geiger famously and logically responded , `` '' the last time i checked my textbooks , the specific therapy for malnutrition was food . '' '' ( laughter ) so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history . ''
but the truth is i was devastated .
`` here we are , 45 years after geiger has prescribed food for his patients , and i have doctors telling me , `` on those issues , we practice a 'do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy . '' ''
forty-five years after geiger , health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources .
so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day .
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients , and especially low-income patients , healthy , that we did n't use it ?
if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system , why do n't we just do it ?
these questions , in my mind , are not hard because the answers are complicated , they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves .
my belief is that it 's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system , or even admit that we have any at all .
because if we did , they would be so removed from our current reality .
but that does n't change my belief that all of us , deep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of desires .
that if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly , that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare : that it keep us healthy .
this aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one .
and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system .
it 's just a set of choices that people make .
what if we decided to make a different set of choices ?
these things are ours .
they will be used for our purposes .
`` they will be used to realize our aspiration '' '' ? ''
so that 's where health leads began .
we started with the prescription pad — a very ordinary piece of paper — and we asked , not what do patients need to get healthy — antibiotics , an inhaler , medication — but what do patients need to be healthy , to not get sick in the first place ?
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose .
`` they 're asked , `` '' are you running out of food at the end of the month ? ''
`` do you have safe housing ? '' '' and when the doctor begins the visit , she knows height , weight , is there food at home , is the family living in a shelter . ''
and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices , but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient , using health leads like any other sub-specialty referral .
and we gave it a shot .
you need more .
and on the other hand , it 's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool .
in the private sector , when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed-cost investment , it 's called a billion-dollar company .
but in my world , it 's called reduced obesity and diabetes .
it 's called healthcare — a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health , not just manage disease .
so every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country .
and what do they do when they 're there ?
they sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine .
but mostly we all just sit there forever , waiting .
how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting ?
but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously , the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on ?
and of course all of this requires a broader workforce .
but if we 're creative , we already have that too .
health just takes more time .
it requires a non-clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
now we may think that 's good or bad , but in either case it 's real .
and health leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities .
new york alone has half a million college students .
and they leave with the conviction , the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care .
and the thing is , there 's thousands of these folks already out there .
`` mia says , `` '' when my classmates write a prescription , they think their work is done . ''
when i write a prescription , i think , can the family read the prescription ?
do they have transportation to the pharmacy ?
do they have food to take with the prescription ?
do they have insurance to fill the prescription ?
but the truth is i 've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
it will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists , but by how rarely we needed them .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
growing up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of chinese characters .
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china .
over the past few years , i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
i started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning chinese might be useful .
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
since we only have five minutes , it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way .
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
you only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
today i 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
you are ready ?
open your mouth as wide as possible until it 's square .
you get a mouth .
this is a person going for a walk .
person .
`` if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , `` '' help ! i 'm on fire ! '' '' — this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but i like to think that way . whichever works for you . ''
this is a tree .
tree .
this is a mountain .
the sun .
the moon .
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
i call these eight characters radicals .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
a person .
`` if someone walks behind , that is `` '' to follow . '' '' as the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd . ''
`` if a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , `` '' it was this big . '' '' the person inside the mouth , the person is trapped . ''
he 's a prisoner , just like jonah inside the whale .
one tree is a tree . two trees together , we have the woods .
three trees together , we create the forest .
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
`` put a mouth on the top of the tree , that 's `` '' idiot . '' '' ( laughter ) easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic . ''
remember fire ?
two fires together , i get really hot .
three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
set the fire underneath the two trees , it 's burning .
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
two suns together , prosperous .
three together , that 's sparkles .
put the sun and the moon shining together , it 's brightness .
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
the sun is coming up above the horizon . sunrise .
a door . put a plank inside the door , it 's a door bolt .
put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
knock knock . is anyone home ?
this person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
on the left , we have a woman .
two women together , they have an argument .
( laughter ) three women together , be careful , it 's adultery .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
the next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . it 's a volcano .
we know japan is the land of the rising sun .
this is a sun placed with the origin , because japan lies to the east of china .
so a sun , origin together , we build japan .
a person behind japan , what do we get ?
a japanese person .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
in ancient china , that means in exile , because chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage . thank you .

i 'd like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the university of california .
just think about this problem for a second .
here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
it can contemplate the meaning of infinity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of god .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings : how does this all come about ?
well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
we 're looking at neurons here .
there are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
and each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain .
and based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .
so , how do you go about studying the brain ?
one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
this is what i spoke about in the last ted .
today i 'll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy , in parma , by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .
now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years .
these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
for example , if i do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
if i reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object .
these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action .
so , here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something , but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something .
and this is truly astonishing .
because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view .
it 's almost as though it 's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person 's action .
now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person 's point of view .
so , this is important for imitation and emulation .
well , why is that important ?
well , let 's take a look at the next slide .
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
now , let 's look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
if you go back in time about [ 75,000 ] to 100,000 years ago , let 's look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
and that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior .
all of that happened relatively quickly .
even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly .
and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people 's actions .
so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
so , this made evolution suddenly lamarckian , instead of darwinian .
darwinian evolution is slow ; it takes hundreds of thousands of years .
a polar bear , to evolve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100,000 years .
a human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . what the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes .
and then once it 's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population .
this is the basis . the imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different .
and that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch .
in other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires .
but the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being touched .
so , it 's empathizing the other person being touched .
so , most of them will fire when i 'm touched in different locations . different neurons for different locations .
but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
so , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy .
now , the question then arises : if i simply watch another person being touched , why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
i mean , i empathize with that person but i do n't literally feel the touch .
`` well , that 's because you 've got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying `` '' do n't worry , you 're not being touched . ''
`` so , empathize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you 'll get confused and muddled . '' '' okay , so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch . ''
but if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if i now watch you being touched , i literally feel it in my hand .
in other words , you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
so , i call them gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons .
( laughter ) and this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
all that 's separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
remove the skin , you experience that person 's touch in your mind .
you 've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
and this , of course , is the basis of much of eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people .
you are , in fact , connected not just via facebook and internet , you 're actually quite literally connected by your neurons .
and there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
and there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else 's consciousness .
and this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
it emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
so , you have a patient with a phantom limb . if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom .
now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person 's hand , massage the other person 's hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged .
so , here you have my last slide .
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
c.p . snow spoke of the two cultures : science on the one hand , humanities on the other ; never the twain shall meet .
so , i 'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness , representation of self , what separates you from other human beings , what allows you to empathize with other human beings , and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization , which is unique to human beings . thank you .

one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and i 'm telling a story that many of you know , because steve 's columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
nathaniel dropped out of juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
i encourage all of you to read steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental — if you 'll pardon the pun — in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven 's first and fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven 's fourth symphony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall — he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
( laughter ) so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and nathaniel 's manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete — mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven and brahms , bruckner , all the b 's , from bartók , all the way up to esa-pekka salonen .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we 're at walt disney concert hall or on skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
( applause ) robert gupta : i 'm going to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists .
so , please forgive me .
( laughter ) ( music ) ( applause )
well , there 's lots to talk about , but i think i 'm just going to play to start off .
( music ) ♫ when i wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ i pour the coffee ♫ ♫ i read the paper ♫ ♫ and then i slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ so feed the fishes ♫ ♫ you sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ like it 's gon na be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on earth ♫ ( applause ) all right .
so , i wanted to do something special today .
i want to debut a new song that i 've been working on in the last five or six months .
and there 's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience , especially when it 's half-finished .
( laughter ) i 'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it .
because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .
and so this is basically a song about loops , but not the kind of loops that i make up here .
they 're feedback loops .
and in the audio world that 's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source , and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound .
and i 'm going to demonstrate for you .
( laughter ) i 'm not going to hurt you . do n't worry .
♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop , feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a — ( feedback ) all right . i do n't know if that was necessary to demonstrate — ( laughter ) — but my point is it 's the sound of self-destruction .
and i 've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms , from , say , the ecological , okay .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly .
so like , you ca n't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease , and inbreeding and incest and , let 's see , what 's the other one ?
biological — there 's autoimmune diseases , where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host , or the person .
and then — okay , this is where we get to the song — kind of bridges the gap to the emotional .
because although i 've used scientific terms in songs , it 's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical .
and there 's some things you just do n't need to have in songs .
so i 'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody .
and so , i do n't know if you 've ever had this , but when i close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep , i ca n't stop thinking about my own eyes .
and it 's like your eyes start straining to see themselves .
that 's what it feels like to me .
it 's not pleasant .
i 'm sorry if i put that idea in your head .
( laughter ) it 's impossible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they seem to be trying .
so that 's getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
or ears being able to hear themselves — it 's just impossible .
that 's the thing .
so , i 've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who 's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they 're left to do the deed themselves , if that 's possible .
and that 's what the song is asking .
all right .
it does n't have a name yet .
( music ) ♫ go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ give yourself a hand , the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ and the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ and the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'cause it 's your ear , oh oh ♫ ♫ you 've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ took yourself apart ♫ ♫ you made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ no one can break your heart ♫ ♫ so you wear it out ♫ ♫ and you wring it out ♫ ♫ and you wear it out ♫ ♫ and you break it yourself ♫
♫ breaking your own , break it yourself ♫ ♫ breaking your own , break it yourself ♫ ♫ breaking your own ♫ ( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
all right .
it 's kind of cool . songwriters can sort of get away with murder .
you can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research .
but , you know , i think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now , just a little bit .
`` ( applause ) i 'm going to finish up with a song of mine called `` '' weather systems .

what do you do when you have a headache ?
you swallow an aspirin .
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestines and various other organs first .
and this is a big problem , particularly in hiv patients .
when they take their anti-hiv drugs , these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood , and increasing the cd4 cell counts .
but they are also notorious for their adverse side effects , but mostly bad , because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood , and worse , by the time they get to the sites where it matters most : within the hiv viral reservoirs .
these areas in the body — such as the lymph nodes , the nervous system , as well as the lungs — where the virus is sleeping , and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-hiv drugs therapy .
however , upon discontinuation of therapy , the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood .
now , all this is a big problem in treating hiv with the current drug treatment , which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients .
`` one day , i sat and thought , `` '' can we deliver anti-hiv directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? '' '' as a laser scientist , the answer was just before my eyes : lasers , of course . ''
if they can be used for dentistry , for diabetic wound-healing and surgery , they can be used for anything imaginable , including transporting drugs into cells .
as a matter of fact , we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes , which open and close almost immediately in hiv-infected cells , in order to deliver drugs within them .
`` `` '' how is that possible ? '' '' you may ask . ''
well , we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of hiv-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug .
the laser pierces the cell , while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds .
before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .
now , we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in petri dishes , but the goal is to get this technology in the human body , apply it in the human body .
`` `` '' how is that possible ? '' '' you may ask . ''
well , the answer is : through a three-headed device .
using the first head , which is our laser , we will make an incision in the site of infection .
using the second head , which is a camera , we meander to the site of infection .
finally , using a third head , which is a drug-spreading sprinkler , we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection , while the laser is again used to poke those cells open .
well , this might not seem like much right now .
but one day , if successful , this technology can lead to complete eradication of hiv in the body .
yes . a cure for hiv .
this is every hiv researcher 's dream — in our case , a cure lead by lasers .
thank you .

humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors , where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye : microorganisms .
buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems .
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
the fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans , and with the human-built environment .
and today , architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
we spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments , like this building here — environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering , heating and air conditioning .
given the amount of time that we spend indoors , it 's important to understand how this affects our health .
at the biology and the built environment center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
we looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated , which are the data points in the blue .
we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study .
and we also sampled the outdoor air .
if you look at the x-axis of this graph , you 'll see that what we commonly want to do — which is keeping the outdoors out — we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that 's outside , you 'll see that there 's a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
but if you look at the blue data points , which is mechanically ventilated air , it 's not as diverse .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you 'll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you 're outdoors .
so to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram , which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .
the data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart .
and the first things that you can see from this graph is , if you look at the blue data points , which are the mechanically ventilated air , they 're not simply a subset of the green data points , which are the outdoor air .
what we 've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans .
it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit .
and this is because we 're all constantly shedding microbes .
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .
and when you 're outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
why does this matter ?
it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states .
hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .
and the model that we 're working with in hospitals , and also with many , many different buildings , is to keep the outdoors out .
and this model may not necessarily be the best for our health .
and given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections , or hospital-acquired infections , this is a clue that it 's a good time to reconsider our current practices .
so just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we 're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
i 've heard somebody say that you 're as healthy as your gut .
and for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
thank you .

to most of you , this is a device to buy , sell , play games , watch videos .
i think it might be a lifeline .
i think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
texting : i know i say texting and a lot of you think sexting , a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see — hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else — or trying to translate the abbreviations lol , lmao , hmu .
i can help you with those later .
but the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
it might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
( laughter ) the average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month , unless she 's a girl , then it 's closer to 4,000 .
and the secret is she opens every single one .
texting has a 100 percent open rate .
now the parents are really alarmed .
it 's a 100 percent open rate even if she does n't respond to you when you ask her when she 's coming home for dinner .
i promise she read that text .
and this is n't some suburban iphone-using teen phenomenon .
texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth .
i know this because at dosomething.org , which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in america , about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging .
we 're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that .
we 're finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
we 've also found an unintended consequence .
we 've been getting text messages back like these .
`` `` '' i do n't want to go to school today . ''
`` the boys call me faggot . '' '' `` `` i was cutting , my parents found out , and so i stopped . ''
`` but i just started again an hour ago . '' '' or , `` '' he wo n't stop raping me . ''
he told me not to tell anyone .
`` it 's my dad . are you there ? '' '' that last one 's an actual text message that we received . ''
and yeah , we 're there .
i will not forget the day we got that text message .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
because this is n't what we do .
we do social change .
kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there 's nowhere else to turn that they 're sending them to us .
so think about it , a text hotline ; it 's pretty powerful .
it 's fast , it 's pretty private .
no one hears you in a stall , you 're just texting quietly .
it 's real time .
we can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
that 's great .
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
because i 'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals .
i want to prevent this shit from happening .
so think about a cop .
there 's something in new york city .
the police did it . it used to be just guess work , police work .
and then they started crime mapping .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things — charting the future essentially .
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
in fact , the year after the nypd put compstat in place , the murder rate fell 60 percent .
so think about the data from a crisis text line .
there is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape — no census .
maybe there 's some studies , some longitudinal studies , that cost lots of money and took lots of time .
or maybe there 's some anecdotal evidence .
imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
you could inform legislation .
you could inform school policy .
`` you could say to a principal , `` '' you 're having a problem every thursday at three o'clock . ''
`` what 's going on in your school ? '' '' you could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result . ''
this is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
because while people are talking about data , making it possible for facebook to mine my friend from the third grade , or target to know when it 's time for me to buy more diapers , or some dude to build a better baseball team , i 'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school , to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father 's raping her .
thank you .

in the spring of 2016 , a legal battle between apple and the federal bureau of investigation captured the world 's attention .
apple has built security features into its mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner .
that means that criminals , hackers and yes , even governments are all locked out .
for apple 's customers , this is a great thing .
but governments are not so happy .
you see , apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business .
apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors .
ios is made by apple . android is made by google .
apple has spent a lot of time and money to make sure that its products are as secure as possible .
apple encrypts all data stored on iphones by default , and text messages sent from one apple customer to another apple customer are encrypted by default without the user having to take any actions .
what this means is that , if the police seize an iphone and it has a password , they 'll have a difficult time getting any data off of it , if they can do it at all .
in contrast , the security of android just really is n't as good .
so if the police seize an android phone , chances are , they 'll be able to get all the data they want off of that device .
two smartphones from two of the biggest companies in the world ; one that protects data by default , and one that does n't .
apple is a seller of luxury goods .
it dominates the high end of the market .
and we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that include more features .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
`` but the dominance of android has led to what i call the `` '' digital security divide . '' '' that is , there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy and security of the rich , who can afford devices that secure their data by default , and of the poor , whose devices do very little to protect them by default . ''
so , think of the average apple customer : a banker , a lawyer , a doctor , a politician .
these individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets that encrypt their calls , their text messages , all the data on the device , without them doing really anything to secure their information .
in contrast , the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance .
in the united states , where i live , african-americans are more likely to be seen as suspicious or more likely to be profiled , and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance .
but african-americans are also disproportionately likely to use android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance .
this is a problem .
we must remember that surveillance is a tool .
it 's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power .
and while i think it 's absolutely great that companies like apple are making it easy for people to encrypt , if the only people who can protect themselves from the gaze of the government are the rich and powerful , that 's a problem .
and it 's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem .
it 's a civil rights problem .
so the lack of default security in android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users who are depending on these devices .
this is actually a problem for our democracy .
i 'll explain what i mean .
modern social movements rely on technology — from black lives matter to the arab spring to occupy wall street .
the organizers of these movements and the members of these movements increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones .
and so , naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones .
now , it 's quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone and be protected from government surveillance .
thank you .
( applause ) helen walters : chris , thank you so much .
i have a question for you .
we saw recently in the press that mark zuckerberg from facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack .
so i wanted to ask you a personal question , which is : do you do that ?
and , on behalf of everyone here , particularly myself , should we be doing that ?
should we be covering these things ?
christopher soghoian : putting a sticker — actually , i like band-aids , because you can remove them and put them back on whenever you want to make a call or a skype call .
there really is malware , malicious software out there that can take over your web cam , even without the light turning on .
this is used by criminals . this is used by stalkers .
`` you can buy $ 19.99 `` '' spy on your ex-girlfriend '' '' software online . ''
it 's really terrifying .
and then , of course , it 's used by governments .
and there 's obviously a sexual violence component to this , which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively against women and other people who can be shamed in our society .
hw : wow . thank you so much . cs : thank you .
hw : thanks , chris .

i 'm an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist .
i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
i mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
and that was what i did .
and i ended up in jamaica , in the west indies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , structurally , that i ever saw in my life .
and this picture here , it 's really interesting , it shows two things : first of all , it 's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s , you took pictures in black and white .
the other thing it shows you is that , although there 's this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
those reefs at discovery bay , jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years .
we were the best and the brightest .
people came to study our reefs from australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
and the view of scientists about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be , was based on these reefs without any fish .
then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , hurricane allen .
i put half the lab up in my house .
the wind blew very strong .
the waves were 25 to 50 feet high .
`` and the reefs disappeared , and new islands formed , and we thought , `` '' well , we 're real smart . ''
`` we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . '' '' and we published a paper in science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane . ''
and we predicted what would happen , and we got it all wrong .
and the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died .
and within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
and that is the same reef ; that 's the same reef 15 years ago ; that 's the same reef today .
the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .
and that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
now , that 's my little , depressing story .
all of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories .
there are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it 's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being , because it just keeps getting worse .
and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what 's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .
and so i 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
we hear a lot about the collapse of cod .
it 's difficult to imagine that two , or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod .
cod fed most of the people of western europe .
`` it fed the slaves brought to the antilles , the song `` '' jamaica farewell '' '' — `` '' ackee rice salt fish are nice '' '' — is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada . ''
it all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s : 35,000 people lost their jobs .
and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
it 's a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .
you ought to read the label to find out where it came from , but it 's still cheap , and everybody thinks it 's okay .
it 's hard to communicate this , and one way that i think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish , because people like to go out and catch fish .
it 's one of those things .
this picture here shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of key west in florida , drink a lot of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , come back with the biggest and the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish .
well , that 's what it 's like now , but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock .
the trophy fish were so big that you could n't put any of those small fish up on it .
and the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds , goliath grouper , and if you wanted to go out and kill something , you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish .
and they tasted really good .
and people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little , tiny fish .
and that 's everywhere .
it 's not just the fish , though , that are disappearing .
industrial fishing uses big stuff , big machinery .
we use nets that are 20 miles long .
we use longlines that have one million or two million hooks .
and we trawl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away .
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
this is a photograph , a typical photograph , of what the continental shelves of the world look like .
you can see the rows in the bottom , the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .
what that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
what it is now is mud , and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud , to parking lot , is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity .
we 've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
we tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days .
and all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .
and i 'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution : one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients .
so this is the infamous caulerpa taxifolia , the so-called killer algae .
a book was written about it .
it 's a bit of an embarrassment .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
it 's very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean .
`` i do n't know how many of you remember the movie `` the little shop of horrors , '' but this is the plant of `` '' the little shop of horrors . '' '' but , instead of devouring the people in the shop , what it 's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern mediterranean sea . ''
we do n't know anything that eats it , we 're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stands , it 's the monster from hell , about which nobody knows what to do .
now another form of pollution that 's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients .
the green revolution , all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we use too much of it .
it 's subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it .
it runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plankton , the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .
but since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there 's nothing to eat the plankton and there 's more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton .
and when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
and in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that ca n't swim away .
so , what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish , as you see on the left in front of you .
and the only fishery left — and it is a commercial fishery — is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right , where there used to be prawns .
even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
and another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .
that picture on the left is just staggering to me .
i have talked about it a million times , but it 's unbelievable .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta , and the lower left of that picture is the texas-mexico border .
you 're looking at the entire northwestern gulf of mexico ; you 're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right .
and in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore .
that 's the same species .
and as it comes to shore and the wind blows , and little droplets of the water get into the air , the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress .
and that 's retirement homes on the west coast of florida .
a friend and i did this thing in hollywood we called hollywood ocean night , and i was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what 's going on .
`` and i said , `` '' so , imagine you 're in a movie called 'escape from malibu ' because all the beautiful people have moved to north dakota , where it 's clean and safe . ''
`` and the only people who are left there are the people who ca n't afford to move away from the coast , because the coast , instead of being paradise , is harmful to your health . '' '' and then this is amazing . ''
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .
this is from the coast of brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
the reason that it attracted so much attention , besides the fact that it 's disgusting , is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die , and a farmer died of it , and you can imagine the scandal that happened .
and so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .
and then , of course , there 's climate change , and we all know about climate change .
i guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea .
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage .
well , the northwest passage is already there .
i think it 's sort of funny ; it 's on the siberian coast , maybe the russians will charge tolls .
the governments of the world are taking this really seriously .
the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
for all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the cia and the navies of norway and the u.s. and canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
the other kinds of effects of climate change — this is coral bleaching . it 's a beautiful picture , right ?
all that white coral .
except it 's supposed to be brown .
what happens is that the corals are a symbiosis , and they have these little algal cells that live inside them .
and the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .
but when it gets too hot , the algae ca n't make the sugar .
`` the corals say , `` '' you cheated . you did n't pay your rent . '' '' they kick them out , and then they die . ''
not all of them die ; some of them survive , some more are surviving , but it 's really bad news .
to try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go camping in july somewhere in europe or in north america , and you wake up the next morning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the trees , as far as you can see , have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked .
and you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves .
`` and then you read in the paper a few weeks later , `` oh , by the way , a quarter of those died . '' ''
well , that 's what happened in the indian ocean during the 1998 el nino , an area vastly greater than the size of north america and europe , when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died .
and then the really scary thing about all of this — the overfishing , the pollution and the climate change — is that each thing does n't happen in a vacuum .
but there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks , the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts .
and the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put humpty dumpty back together again ?
i mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
but what does that mean ?
we really do n't know .
so what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
well , there wo n't be any fish except for minnows , and the water will be pretty dirty , and all those kinds of things and full of mercury , etc. , etc .
and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they 'll start to merge , and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global , coastal ocean .
then you sure wo n't want to eat fish that were raised in it , because it would be a kind of gastronomic russian roulette .
sometimes you have a toxic bloom ; sometimes you do n't .
that does n't sell .
the really scary things though are the physical , chemical , oceanographic things that are happening .
as the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it 's warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
we say it becomes more strongly stratified .
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
and , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , does n't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .
so the question is : how are we all going to respond to this ?
and we can do all sorts of things to fix it , but in the final analysis , the thing we really need to fix is ourselves .
it 's not about the fish ; it 's not about the pollution ; it 's not about the climate change .
it 's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today .
so the question is : will we respond to this or not ?
i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that .
thank you . ( applause )
so we were up on top of our bunk beds .
that 's no problem , as most of you know , because i can just delete that dot .
i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error .
i 'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society .
meet joe .
joe 's 32 years old and a murderer .
i 'd like you to imagine this place .
what lay at the root of their behavior ?
was there a neurological cause for their condition ?
so i 'd like to speak about change , and especially about emotional change .
at the age of five or six i would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door .
and i suppose that 's how i found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at wormwood scrubs .
joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression .
`` the prison warden , looking equally indifferent , said , `` '' any trouble , just press the red buzzer , and we 'll be around as soon as we can . '' '' ( laughter ) i sat down . ''
the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me .
( laughter ) i looked at joe .
whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately , they failed to show the emotions required .
they failed to show a physical response .
it was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy .
so we wanted to look closer at this to use mri to image their brains .
that turned out to be not such an easy task .
after some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
these individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood .
there was something else .
people like joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala .
the amygdala is an almond-shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain .
normally , the more empathic a person is , the larger and more active their amygdala is .
so let 's take a step back .
normally , acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up , like learning to speak .
the fact that this developmental progression is universal , irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit , strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn .
if you doubt this , try , as i 've done , to renege on a promise you 've made to a four-year-old .
it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness .
the early years are crucial .
there seems to be a window of opportunity , after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult , like adults learning a foreign language .
that 's not to say it 's impossible .
so can brains change ?
for over 100 years , neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood , no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
that was the dogma .
now , they do n't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street , but their improved environment results in healthy , sociable behavior .
in some areas of the brain , more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed .
we 're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have , but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
i 've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-improvement .
and i 've done this in three parts .
so first i started with the mind .
`` and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z — or , more precisely , from `` '' a-ak '' '' to `` '' zywiec . '' '' and here 's a little image of that . ''
and this was an amazing year .
it was really a fascinating journey .
it was painful at times , especially for those around me .
my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact i inserted into conversation .
so it had its downsides .
but after that , i decided to work on the spirit .
as i mentioned last year , i grew up with no religion at all .
i 'm jewish , but i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .
( laughter ) not really .
but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it .
so i decided to follow all the rules of the bible .
and from the ten commandments to growing my beard — because leviticus says you can not shave .
so this is what i looked like by the end .
thank you for that reaction .
( laughter ) i look a little like moses , or ted kaczynski .
i got both of them .
so there was the topiary there .
and there 's the sheep .
now the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be , the healthiest person alive .
so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years .
and i just finished a couple of months ago .
and i have to say , thank god .
because living so healthily was killing me .
( laughter ) it was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it 's just mind-boggling .
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .
and they were telling me all the things i had to do .
i had to eat right , exercise , meditate , pet dogs , because that lowers the blood pressure .
i wrote the book on a treadmill , and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .
i had to put on sunscreen .
this was no small feat , because if you listen to dermatologists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen .
and you have to reapply it every two to four hours .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year .
there was the washing of hands .
i had to do that properly .
and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs .
so that took a lot of time .
i also tried to be the safest person i could be , because that 's a part of health .
i was inspired by the danish safety council .
`` they started a public campaign that says , `` '' a walking helmet is a good helmet . '' '' so they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking , but also for walking around . ''
and you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets .
( laughter ) well yeah , i tried that .
now it 's a little extreme , i admit .
`` but if you think about this , this is actually — the `` '' freakonomics '' '' authors wrote about this — that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving . ''
so something to think about tonight if you 've had a couple .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
all of the markers went in the right direction .
my cholesterol went down , i lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant .
so that was nice .
and it was successful overall .
but i also learned that i was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family .
and as dan buettner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health .
so i finished .
and i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
i went to the dark side , and i just indulged myself .
it was like something out of caligula .
( laughter ) without the sex part .
because i have three young kids , so that was n't happening .
but the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
and i finally have stabilized .
so now i 'm back to adopting many — not all ; i do n't wear a helmet anymore — but dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during my year .
it was really a life-changing project .
and i , of course , do n't have time to go into all of them .
let me just tell you two really quickly .
the first is — and this was surprising to me ; i did n't expect this to come out — but i live a much quieter life now .
because we live in such a noisy world .
there 's trains and planes and cars and bill o'reilly , he 's very noisy .
( laughter ) and this is a real underestimated , under-appreciated health hazard — not just because it harms our hearing , which it obviously does , but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response .
a loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year .
and it was done in europe .
and they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in europe because of noise pollution .
so they think it 's actually very deadly .
and by the way , it 's also terrible for your brain .
it really impairs cognition .
and our founding fathers knew about this .
when they wrote the constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate .
so without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
so as a patriot , i felt it was important to — i wear all the earplugs and the earphones , and it 's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way .
and the second point i want to make , the final point , is that — and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed — that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
and just to give you one instance of this : food .
the junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what 's the most pleasurable .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
to give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel .
so i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes — throw in some sunflower seeds .
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos .
( laughter ) and it has made me a healthier person .
so that is it .
the book about it comes out in april .
`` it 's called `` '' drop dead healthy . '' '' and i hope that i do n't get sick during the book tour . ''
that 's my greatest hope .
so thank you very much .
( applause )
good morning . how are you ?
i have an interest in education .
and yet we 're meant to be educating them for it .
shakespeare being seven ?
i 've got two kids ; he 's 21 now , my daughter 's 16 .
he did n't want to come to los angeles .
they 're just a form of life , another form of life .
the brain is n't divided into compartments .
because you are , are n't you ?
if i 'm cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone 's on the hook , if she comes in i get annoyed .
`` take her to a dance school . '' '' i said , `` '' what happened ? '' '' she said , `` '' she did . i ca n't tell you how wonderful it was . ''
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me .
`` people who had to move to think . '' '' who had to move to think . ''
the human voice : it 's the instrument we all play .
it 's the most powerful sound in the world , probably .
`` it 's the only one that can start a war or say `` '' i love you . '' '' and yet many people have the experience that when they speak , people do n't listen to them . ''
and why is that ?
how can we speak powerfully to make change in the world ?
what i 'd like to suggest , there are a number of habits that we need to move away from .
i 'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list , but these seven , i think , are pretty large habits that we can all fall into .
first , gossip .
speaking ill of somebody who 's not present .
not a nice habit , and we know perfectly well the person gossiping , five minutes later , will be gossiping about us .
second , judging .
we know people who are like this in conversation , and it 's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you 're being judged and found wanting at the same time .
third , negativity .
you can fall into this .
my mother , in the last years of her life , became very negative , and it 's hard to listen .
`` i remember one day , i said to her , `` '' it 's october 1 today , '' '' and she said , `` '' i know , is n't it dreadful ? '' '' ( laughter ) it 's hard to listen when somebody 's that negative . ( laughter ) ''
and another form of negativity , complaining .
well , this is the national art of the u.k .
it 's our national sport .
we complain about the weather , sport , about politics , about everything , but actually , complaining is viral misery .
it 's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world .
excuses .
we 've all met this guy .
maybe we 've all been this guy .
some people have a blamethrower .
they just pass it on to everybody else and do n't take responsibility for their actions , and again , hard to listen to somebody who is being like that .
penultimate , the sixth of the seven , embroidery , exaggeration .
it demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
for example , if i see something that really is awesome , what do i call it ?
( laughter ) and then , of course , this exaggeration becomes lying , and we do n't want to listen to people we know are lying to us .
and finally , dogmatism .
the confusion of facts with opinions .
when those two things get conflated , you 're listening into the wind .
you know , somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true .
it 's difficult to listen to that .
so here they are , seven deadly sins of speaking .
these are things i think we need to avoid .
but is there a positive way to think about this ?
yes , there is .
i 'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones , foundations , that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world .
fortunately , these things spell a word .
`` the word is `` '' hail , '' '' and it has a great definition as well . ''
i 'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head .
i 'm talking about this definition , to greet or acclaim enthusiastically , which is how i think our words will be received if we stand on these four things .
so what do they stand for ?
see if you can guess .
the h , honesty , of course , being true in what you say , being straight and clear .
the a is authenticity , just being yourself .
a friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth , which i think is a lovely way to put it .
the i is integrity , being your word , actually doing what you say , and being somebody people can trust .
and the l is love .
i do n't mean romantic love , but i do mean wishing people well , for two reasons .
first of all , i think absolute honesty may not be what we want .
i mean , my goodness , you look ugly this morning .
perhaps that 's not necessary .
tempered with love , of course , honesty is a great thing .
but also , if you 're really wishing somebody well , it 's very hard to judge them at the same time .
i 'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously .
so hail .
also , now that 's what you say , and it 's like the old song , it is what you say , it 's also the way that you say it .
you have an amazing toolbox .
this instrument is incredible , and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened .
i 'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with , which will increase the power of your speaking .
register , for example .
now , falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time , but there 's a register in between .
i 'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches .
you can locate your voice , however .
so if i talk up here in my nose , you can hear the difference .
if i go down here in my throat , which is where most of us speak from most of the time .
but if you want weight , you need to go down here to the chest .
you hear the difference ?
we vote for politicians with lower voices , it 's true , because we associate depth with power and with authority .
that 's register .
then we have timbre .
it 's the way your voice feels .
again , the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich , smooth , warm , like hot chocolate .
well if that 's not you , that 's not the end of the world , because you can train .
go and get a voice coach .
and there are amazing things you can do with breathing , with posture , and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice .
then prosody . i love prosody .
this is the sing-song , the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning .
it 's root one for meaning in conversation .
people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they do n't have any prosody at all .
`` that 's where the word `` '' monotonic '' '' comes from , or monotonous , monotone . ''
also , we have repetitive prosody now coming in , where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it 's actually not a question , it 's a statement ?
( laughter ) and if you repeat that one , it 's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody , which i think is a shame , so let 's try and break that habit .
pace .
i can get very excited by saying something really quickly , or i can slow right down to emphasize , and at the end of that , of course , is our old friend silence .
there 's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk , is there ?
we do n't have to fill it with ums and ahs .
it can be very powerful .
of course , pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal , but you can do it just with pitch .
where did you leave my keys ?
( higher pitch ) where did you leave my keys ?
so , slightly different meaning in those two deliveries .
and finally , volume .
( loud ) i can get really excited by using volume .
sorry about that , if i startled anybody .
or , i can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet .
some people broadcast the whole time .
try not to do that .
that 's called sodcasting , ( laughter ) imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately .
not nice .
of course , where this all comes into play most of all is when you 've got something really important to do .
it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people .
it might be proposing marriage , asking for a raise , a wedding speech .
whatever it is , if it 's really important , you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it 's going to work on , and no engine works well without being warmed up .
warm up your voice .
actually , let me show you how to do that .
would you all like to stand up for a moment ?
i 'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that i do before every talk i ever do .
any time you 're going to talk to anybody important , do these .
first , arms up , deep breath in , and sigh out , ahhhhh , like that .
one more time .
ahhhh , very good .
now we 're going to warm up our lips , and we 're going to go ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba . very good .
and now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
brrrr . now your lips should be coming alive .
we 're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la .
beautiful . you 're getting really good at this .
and then , roll an r. rrrrrrr .
that 's like champagne for the tongue .
finally , and if i can only do one , the pros call this the siren .
`` it 's really good . it starts with `` '' we '' '' and goes to `` '' aw . '' '' the `` '' we '' '' is high , the `` '' aw '' '' is low . ''
so you go , weeeaawww , weeeaawww .
fantastic . give yourselves a round of applause .
take a seat , thank you .
( applause ) next time you speak , do those in advance .
now let me just put this in context to close .
this is a serious point here .
this is where we are now , right ?
we speak not very well to people who simply are n't listening in an environment that 's all about noise and bad acoustics .
i have talked about that on this stage in different phases .
what would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose ?
or to make that a bit larger , what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound ?
that would be a world that does sound beautiful , and one where understanding would be the norm , and that is an idea worth spreading .
thank you .
( applause )
we all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene , right ?
we 've known it since we were five years old .
why ? because of poor emotional hygiene .
can i say how delighted i am to be away from the calm of westminster and whitehall ? ( laughter ) this is kim , a nine-year-old vietnam girl , her back ruined by napalm , and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war .
this is birhan , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
this is tiananmen square .
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance .
this next is the sudanese girl , a few moments from death , a vulture hovering in the background , a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty .
this is neda , the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago , and she is now the focus , rightly so , of the youtube generation .
and what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we can not see .
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others , however distantly .
what i think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves .
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents — a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified .
there is a story about olof palme , the swedish prime minister , going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s .
`` before he arrived ronald reagan said — and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister — `` isn’t this man a communist ? '' ''
`` the reply was , `` '' no , mr president , he’s an anti-communist . '' '' and ronald reagan said , `` '' i don’t care what kind of communist he is ! '' '' ( laughter ) ronald reagan asked olof palme , the social democratic prime minister of sweden , `` well , what do you believe in ? do you want to abolish the rich ? '' ''
`` he said , `` '' no , i want to abolish the poor . '' '' our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full . ''
i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith , and people of no faith .
but i think what 's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world .
we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet , but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication ; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with ; and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history , and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society .
go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters .
they protested across britain .
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds ?
or if you take eglantyne jebb , the woman who created save the children 90 years ago .
she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of austria , that in britain she wanted to take action , but she had to go house to house , leaflet to leaflet , to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children , an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world .
but what more could she have done if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately ?
now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years .
`` in philippines in 2001 , president estrada — a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime , eventually brought it down and it was , of course , called the `` '' coup de text . '' '' ( laughter ) then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago . ''
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do .
or take burma and the monks that were blogging out , a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening , until these blogs told the world that there was a repression , meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi , who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world , had to be listened to .
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to neda , people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to tehran , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
take , therefore , what modern technology is capable of : the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally .
that , in my view , gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world .
foreign policy can never be the same again . it can not be run by elites ; it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging , who are communicating with each other around the world .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
100 years ago in most countries in europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare .
in the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism , anti-semitism , racism , apartheid , discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world .
i was with nelson mandela a year ago , when he was in london .
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
i was sitting next to nelson mandela — i was very privileged to do so — when amy winehouse came onto the stage . ( laughter ) and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was .
`` amy winehouse said , `` '' nelson mandela and i have a lot in common . ''
`` my husband too has spent a long time in prison . '' '' ( laughter ) nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all . ''
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid .
he said that there was a greater challenge ahead , the challenge of poverty , of climate change — global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society .
we are the first generation which is in a position to do this .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
climate change can not be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
a financial crisis , just as we have seen , could not be solved by america alone or europe alone ; it needed the world to work together .
take the problems of security and terrorism and , equally , the problem of human rights and development : they can not be solved by africa alone ; they can not be solved by america or europe alone .
we can not solve these problems unless we work together .
so the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future .
we have now , and are the first generation with , the power to do this .
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
( applause ) one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations .
take the financial crisis .
if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub-prime market of the united states of america .
if people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many , many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain , and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it , then you can not rely on a system of national supervision .
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world , the poorest part of the world .
we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future , and yet , out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
this is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doctors ; it has 200 nurses ; it has 120 midwives .
you can not begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania , a girl called miriam .
she was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from aids , her mother and then her father .
she was an aids orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for .
she herself was suffering from hiv ; she was suffering from tuberculosis .
i met her in a field , she was ragged , she had no shoes .
when you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv/aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture , so that africa is not a net importer of food , but an exporter of food .
take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world .
burma is in chains , zimbabwe is a human tragedy , in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent .
in the rwanda children 's museum , there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the children 's museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died .
there is a photograph of a boy called david .
beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
`` it said `` '' david , age 10 . '' '' david : ambition to be a doctor . ''
favorite sport : football . what did he enjoy most ?
making people laugh .
how did he die ?
tortured to death .
`` last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death : `` do n't worry . the united nations are coming . '' ''
and we never did .
and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda , and we never did .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world .
so my argument today is basically this .
we have the means by which we could create a truly global society .
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors .
that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work , but we should not lose the chance in this generation , in this decade in particular , with president obama in america , with other people working with us around the world , to create global institutions for the environment , and for finance , and for security and for development , that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples , our desire to bind the world together , and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist .
`` it is said that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences , people used to turn to each other and say about cicero , `` '' great speech . '' '' but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences , people turned to each other and didn’t say `` '' great speech . '' '' they said , `` '' let 's march . '' '' we should be marching towards a global society . ''
thank you .
( applause )
have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging ?
this is a dream of the ages .
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it — kind of like an old shoe .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .
now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
so that suggests that somewhere in these genes , somewhere in the dna , are genes for aging , genes that allow them to have different lifespans .
so if there are genes like that , then you can imagine that , if you could change one of the genes in an experiment , an aging gene , maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan .
and if you could do that , then you could find the genes for aging .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging .
and we did n't study any of these animals .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round worm called c. elegans , which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence .
and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm .
so you can see in black , after a month — they 're very short-lived ; that 's why we like to study them for studies of aging — in black , after a month , the normal worms are all dead .
but at that time , most of the mutant worms are still alive .
and it is n't until twice as long that they 're all dead .
and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here .
so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age — a young adult .
it 's quite a cute little fellow .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
is it miserable ? it does n't seem to be .
it 's active . you ca n't tell the difference really .
and they can be completely fertile — have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do .
now get out your handkerchiefs here .
you 're going to see , in just two weeks , the normal worms are old .
you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there .
but everything else is just lying there .
the animal 's clearly in the nursing home .
and if you look at the tissues of the animal , they 're starting to deteriorate .
you know , even if you 've never seen one of these little c. elegans — which probably most of you have n't seen one — you can tell they 're old — is n't that interesting ?
so there 's something about aging that 's kind of universal .
and now here is the daf-2 mutant .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
it 's the same age , but it 's not in the nursing home ; it 's going skiing .
this is what 's really cool : it 's aging more slowly .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
and when i tell people about this , they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 .
but it 's really more like this : let 's say you 're a 30 year-old guy — or in your 30s — and you 're a bachelor and you 're dating people .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
`` and you 're in a restaurant , and you say , `` '' well how old are you ? '' '' she says , `` '' i 'm 60 . '' '' that 's what it 's like . and you would never know . ''
you would never know , until she told you .
( laughter ) okay .
so what is the daf-2 gene ?
well as you know , genes , which are part of the dna , they 're instructions to make a protein that does something .
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell .
so part of it is like a baseball glove .
part of it 's on the outside , and it 's catching the hormone as it comes by in green .
and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
i just told you that , if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell , that you get a receptor that does n't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging .
that 's what that arrow means .
it speeds up aging . it makes it go faster .
so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself , speeding up aging .
so this is altogether really , really interesting .
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes , and specifically by hormones .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
there 's lots of hormones . there 's testosterone , adrenalin .
you know about a lot of them .
these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
now you 've all heard of at least insulin .
insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time , but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about — maybe they also affect aging .
and it 's looking like that 's the case .
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
and that is the case in flies .
if you change this hormone pathway in flies , they live longer .
and also in mice — and mice are mammals like us .
so it 's an ancient pathway , because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals .
and also , the common precursor also gave rise to people .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
and there are hints of this .
so for example , there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city .
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations — that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 .
and these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted .
it damaged the gene .
so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age-related disease ?
as you age , you 're much more likely to get cancer , alzheimer 's disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it 's not as severe .
so it 's really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they 're still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
so it suggests that , if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans , maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
how could that work ?
well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage .
and the way that they 're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo .
so in a daf-2 mutant — you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .
the receptor is n't working as well .
under those conditions , the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus — that little compartment there in the middle of the cell — and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it .
you see one gene . there are lots of genes actually that bind on foxo .
and it 's just sitting on one of them .
so foxo turns on a lot of genes .
and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes i call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well — to fold correctly and function correctly .
and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged .
dna repair genes are more active in these animals .
and the immune system is more active .
and many of these different genes , we 've shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .
so it 's really interesting .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
they have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage , which we think makes them live longer .
so what about the normal worm ?
well when the daf-2 receptor is active , then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the dna is .
so it ca n't turn the genes on .
that 's how it works . that 's why we do n't see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
but what good is this for the worm ?
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions — in the good times — when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment .
then they promote the uptake of nutrients .
you can store the food , use it for energy , grow , etc .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop — for example , having limited food supply .
and that , we think , is registered by the animal as a danger signal , a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity .
so it activates foxo , foxo goes to the dna , and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself .
and that 's why we think the animals live longer .
so you can think of foxo as being like a building superintendent .
so maybe he 's a little bit lazy , but he 's there , he 's taking care of the building .
but it 's deteriorating .
and then suddenly , he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane .
so he does n't actually do anything himself .
he gets on the telephone — just like foxo gets on the dna — and he calls up the roofer , the window person , the painter , the floor person .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
and then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in .
and not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there is n't a hurricane .
so that 's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists .
now the really cool thing about foxo is that there are different forms of it .
we all have foxo genes , but we do n't all have exactly the same form of the foxo gene .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
and that 's the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
`` and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , `` '' okay , are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live a really long time ? '' '' and there are . ''
we do n't know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
so this is really exciting to me .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases .
and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work .
there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
and for at least one of them , there is a drug .
there 's one called tor , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway .
and mutations that damage the tor gene — just like the daf-2 mutations — extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice .
but in this case , there 's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse — even when it 's pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse — if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
now i do n't want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .
so this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer .
but still , here in the year 2011 , there 's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan , which comes out of this science that 's been done in all these different animals .
so i 'm really optimistic , and i think it wo n't be too long , i hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true .
thank you .
( applause ) matt ridley : thank you , cynthia .
let me get this straight .
although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
so if you stop taking the drug , the protein would go back to normal .
you could change the genes in principle .
there is n't the technology to do that .
but i do n't think that 's a good idea .
and the reason is that these hormones , like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway , they 're essential .
if you knock them out completely , then you 're very sick .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
and also , there are other ways of activating foxo that do n't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer .
mr : i was n't suggesting that i was going to go and do it , but ...
( laughter ) there 's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence .
there are some creatures on this planet already that do n't really do aging .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
ck : there are . there are some animals that do n't seem to age .
for example , there are some tortoises called blanding 's turtles .
and they grow to be about this size .
and they 've been tagged , and they 've been found to be 70 years old .
and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you ca n't tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they 're better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year .
and there are other examples of these kinds of animals , like turns , certain kinds of birds are like this .
and nobody knows if they really can live forever , or what keeps them from aging .
it 's not clear .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and our long-lived mutants are too .
they 're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the worm , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all — but we do n't know .
mr : but what you 're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan .
ck : yes , that 's right .
it 's more like , say , if you were a dog .
`` you notice that you 're getting old , and you look at your human and you think , `` '' why is n't this human getting old ? '' '' they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan . ''
it 's more like that .
but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
( applause )
ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
i would love to share with you a story .
once upon a time in 19th century germany , there was the book .
now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
it was venerable .
it was ubiquitous .
but it was a little bit boring .
because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device .
but then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
( music ) his name was lothar , lothar meggendorfer .
`` lothar meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , `` '' genug ist genug ! '' '' he grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors . ''
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
history would know lothar meggendorfer as — who else ? — the world 's first true inventor of the children 's pop-up book .
( music ) for this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
( cheering ) they were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning .
lothar meggendorfer was n't the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly was n't the last .
whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling meggendorfer 's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3d , on vhs and on dvd .
there seemed to be no cure for this meggendorferitis .
and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around .
( laughter ) because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
for example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine .
one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in 3d .
( laughter ) and one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
and after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back .
they realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they 've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls .
and this was a cause for celebration .
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
and for the most part , the stories are recycled .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
and they remembered a man , one amazing german , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
and for that , the audience — the lovely , beautiful audience — would live happily ever after .
( applause )
i 'm a storyteller .
there were n't many of them available , and they were n't quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
i come from a conventional , middle-class nigerian family .
my father was a professor .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
so i felt enormous pity for fide 's family .
i was startled .
it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
( laughter ) she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .
but in the u.s. , whenever africa came up , people turned to me .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
now , here is a quote from the writing of a london merchant called john lok , who sailed to west africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage .
in fact , i did not know what african authenticity was .
therefore they were not authentically african .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s .
and , as often happens in america , immigration became synonymous with mexicans .
and then , i was overwhelmed with shame .
`` i told him that i had just read a novel called `` '' american psycho '' '' — ( laughter ) — and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers . ( laughter ) ''
( applause ) now , obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation . ( laughter )
this is not because i am a better person than that student , but because of america 's cultural and economic power , i had many stories of america .
i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill .
i did not have a single story of america .
but i also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
i grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education , so that sometimes , my parents were not paid their salaries .
i 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
it emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar .
what if my mother had told us that fide 's family was poor and hardworking ?
here was a woman , part of the ordinary masses of nigerians , who were not supposed to be readers .
what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music , talented people singing in english and pidgin , and igbo and yoruba and ijo , mixing influences from jay-z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers .
or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
many stories matter .
stories have been used to dispossess and to malign , but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind .
hi , kids .
( laughter ) i 'm 71 .
( applause ) my husband is 76 .
my parents are in their late 90s , and olivia , the dog , is 16 .
so let 's talk about aging .
let me tell you how i feel when i see my wrinkles in the mirror and i realize that some parts of me have dropped and i ca n't find them down there .
`` ( laughter ) mary oliver says in one of her poems , `` '' tell me , what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life ? '' '' me , i intend to live passionately . ''
when do we start aging ?
society decides when we are old , usually around 65 , when we get medicare , but we really start aging at birth .
we are aging right now , and we all experience it differently .
we all feel younger than our real age , because the spirit never ages .
i am still 17 .
sophia loren . look at her .
she says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti .
i tried it and gained 10 pounds in the wrong places .
but attitude , aging is also attitude and health .
but my real mentor in this journey of aging is olga murray .
this california girl at 60 started working in nepal to save young girls from domestic bondage .
at 88 , she has saved 12,000 girls , and she has changed the culture in the country .
( applause ) now it is illegal for fathers to sell their daughters into servitude .
she has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics .
she is always happy and eternally young .
what have i lost in the last decades ?
people , of course , places , and the boundless energy of my youth , and i 'm beginning to lose independence , and that scares me .
ram dass says that dependency hurts , but if you accept it , there is less suffering .
after a very bad stroke , his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness , and he is grateful to the people who help him .
what have i gained ?
freedom : i do n't have to prove anything anymore .
i 'm not stuck in the idea of who i was , who i want to be , or what other people expect me to be .
i do n't have to please men anymore , only animals .
i keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what i still have .
my body may be falling apart , but my brain is not , yet .
i love my brain .
i feel lighter .
i do n't carry grudges , ambition , vanity , none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble .
it 's great to let go .
i should have started sooner .
and i also feel softer because i 'm not scared of being vulnerable .
i do n't see it as weakness anymore .
and i 've gained spirituality .
i 'm aware that before , death was in the neighborhood .
now , it 's next door , or in my house .
i try to live mindfully and be present in the moment .
by the way , the dalai lama is someone who has aged beautifully , but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate ?
( laughter ) meditation helps .
( video ) child : ommm . ommm . ommm .
isabel allende : ommm . ommm . there it is .
and it 's good to start early .
you know , for a vain female like myself , it 's very hard to age in this culture .
inside , i feel good , i feel charming , seductive , sexy .
nobody else sees that . ( laughter ) i 'm invisible .
i want to be the center of attention .
i hate to be invisible .
( laughter ) ( applause ) this is grace dammann .
she has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident .
she says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower , that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses .
she does n't see herself as disabled .
in her mind , she 's still surfing in the ocean .
ethel seiderman , a feisty , beloved activist in the place where i live in california .
she wears red patent shoes , and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
she says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw — well , she says it in another way — and she has tried them all .
( laughter ) i , on the other hand , i still have erotic fantasies with antonio banderas — ( laughter ) — and my poor husband has to put up with it .
so how can i stay passionate ?
i can not will myself to be passionate at 71 .
i have been training for some time , and when i feel flat and bored , i fake it .
attitude , attitude .
how do i train ? i train by saying yes to whatever comes my way : drama , comedy , tragedy , love , death , losses .
yes to life .
and i train by trying to stay in love .
it does n't always work , but you can not blame me for trying .
and , on a final note , retirement in spanish is jubilación .
jubilation . celebration .
we have paid our dues .
we have contributed to society .
now it 's our time , and it 's a great time .
unless you are ill or very poor , you have choices .
i have chosen to stay passionate , engaged with an open heart .
i am working on it every day .
want to join me ?
thank you .
( applause ) june cohen : so isabel — ia : thank you .
ia : aww , thank you . ( applause ) jc : hands down . ia : no , it 's makeup .
moderator : now , would it be awkward if i asked you a follow-up question about your erotic fantasies ?
ia : oh , of course . about what ?
( laughter ) moderator : about your erotic fantasies . ia : with antonio banderas .
moderator : i was just wondering if you have anything more to share .
ia : well , one of them is that — ( laughter ) one of them is that i place a naked antonio banderas on a mexican tortilla , i slather him with guacamole and salsa , i roll him up , and i eat him . ( laughter ) thank you .
( applause )
well , i 'm involved in other things , besides physics .
in fact , mostly now in other things .
one thing is distant relationships among human languages .
and the professional , historical linguists in the u.s .
and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
they do n't like that . they think it 's crank . i do n't think it 's crank .
and there are some brilliant linguists , mostly russians , who are working on that , at santa fe institute and in moscow , and i would love to see where that leads .
does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ?
and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
how many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
chris anderson : do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is ?
murray gell-mann : well , i would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in western europe , in the aurignacian period some 35,000 years ago , or earlier .
i ca n't believe they did all those things and did n't also have a modern language .
so , i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further .
but that does n't mean that all , or many , or most of today 's attested languages could n't descend perhaps from one that 's much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . it 's what we call a bottleneck .
ca : well , philip anderson may have been right .
you may just know more about everything than anyone .
so , it 's been an honor . thank you murray gell-mann .
( applause )
in his inaugural address , barack obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis .
but what did he appeal to ?
he did not , happily , follow in the footsteps of his predecessor , and tell us to just go shopping .
`` nor did he tell us , `` '' trust us . trust your country . ''
`` invest , invest , invest . '' '' instead , what he told us was to put aside childish things . ''
and he appealed to virtue .
virtue is an old-fashioned word .
it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one .
and besides , some of you might be wondering , what the hell does it mean ?
let me begin with an example .
this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen .
and all of the items on it are unremarkable .
they 're the things you would expect : mop the floors , sweep them , empty the trash , restock the cabinets .
it may be a little surprising how many things there are , but it 's not surprising what they are .
but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this : even though this is a very long list , there is n't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .
not one .
the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
and yet , when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like , they encountered mike , who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise , trying to build up his strength , walking slowly up and down the hall .
and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and did n't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day , every day who , at this moment , happened to be taking a nap .
and then there was luke , who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice because the man 's father , who had been keeping a vigil for six months , did n't see luke do it the first time , and his father was angry .
and behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we 're lucky now and then , from doctors , does n't just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .
now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness , care and empathy are an essential part of the job .
and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings .
these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people .
`` and beyond this , they have the moral skill to figure out what `` '' doing right '' '' means . ''
`` `` '' practical wisdom , '' '' aristotle told us , `` is the combination of moral will and moral skill . '' ''
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule , as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .
a wise person knows how to improvise , as luke did when he re-washed the floor .
real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing .
a wise person is like a jazz musician — using the notes on the page , but dancing around them , inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .
a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .
to serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
and finally , perhaps most important , a wise person is made , not born .
wisdom depends on experience , and not just any experience .
you need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving .
you need permission to be allowed to improvise , try new things , occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures .
and you need to be mentored by wise teachers .
when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do their job , they tell you that it takes lots of experience .
and they do n't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .
it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people .
at ted , brilliance is rampant .
it 's scary .
the good news is you do n't need to be brilliant to be wise .
the bad news is that without wisdom , brilliance is n't enough .
it 's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else .
( applause ) now , i hope that we all know this .
there 's a sense in which it 's obvious , and yet , let me tell you a little story .
it 's a story about lemonade .
a dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark .
his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it .
all they had was mike 's hard lemonade , which was five percent alcohol .
dad , being an academic , had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade contained alcohol .
so he brought it back .
and the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it , and called the police , who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital .
the emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood .
and they were ready to let the kid go .
but not so fast .
the wayne county child welfare protection agency said no .
and the child was sent to a foster home for three days .
at that point , can the child go home ?
well , a judge said yes , but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel .
after two weeks , i 'm happy to report , the family was reunited .
`` but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : `` we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . '' ''
how do things like this happen ?
`` scott simon , who told this story on npr , said , `` '' rules and procedures may be dumb , but they spare you from thinking . '' '' and , to be fair , rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household . ''
fair enough .
when things go wrong , as of course they do , we reach for two tools to try to fix them .
one tool we reach for is rules .
better ones , more of them .
the second tool we reach for is incentives .
better ones , more of them .
what else , after all , is there ?
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
regulate , regulate , regulate .
fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job .
how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ?
and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
it 's preposterous on its face .
and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules , rules and incentives may make things better in the short run , but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run .
moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations .
and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing .
and without intending it , by appealing to rules and incentives , we are engaging in a war on wisdom .
let me just give you a few examples , first of rules and the war on moral skill .
the lemonade story is one .
second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : scripted , lock-step curricula .
here 's an example from chicago kindergarten .
`` reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'b . ' `` `` the bath : '' '' assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water . ''
say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .
all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city , every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .
we know why these scripts are there .
we do n't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own .
scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .
and they prevent disaster .
but what they assure in its place is mediocrity .
( applause ) do n't get me wrong . we need rules !
jazz musicians need some notes — most of them need some notes on the page .
we need more rules for the bankers , god knows .
but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising .
and as a result , they lose their gifts , or worse , they stop playing altogether .
now , how about incentives ?
they seem cleverer .
if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason for doing the same thing , it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you 're more likely to do it .
right ?
well , not always .
sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting , and they make people less likely to do it .
i 'll just give you one example because time is racing .
in switzerland , back about 15 years ago , they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps .
there was going to be a national referendum .
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .
`` and they said , `` '' would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? '' '' astonishingly , 50 percent of the citizens said yes . ''
they knew it was dangerous .
they thought it would reduce their property values .
but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens .
the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
`` they said , `` '' if we paid you six weeks ' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? '' '' two reasons . it 's my responsibility and i 'm getting paid . ''
instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
`` what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking , `` '' what is my responsibility ? '' '' all we ask is , `` '' what serves my interests ? '' '' when incentives do n't work , when ceos ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses , the response is always the same . ''
get smarter incentives .
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough .
any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
we need incentives . people have to make a living .
but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word .
it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
`` barack obama said , before he was inaugurated , `` we must ask not just 'is it profitable ? ' but 'is it right ? ' '' and when professions are demoralized , everyone in them becomes dependent on — addicted to — incentives and they stop asking `` '' is it right ? '' '' we see this in medicine . ''
`` ( `` '' although it 's nothing serious , let 's keep an eye on it to make sure it does n't turn into a major lawsuit . '' '' ) and we certainly see it in the world of business . ''
`` ( `` '' in order to remain competitive in today 's marketplace , i 'm afraid we 're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball . '' '' ) ( `` '' i sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now . '' '' ) it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work . ''
so what can we do ?
a few sources of hope : we ought to try to re-moralize work .
one way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
( applause ) there is no better way to show people that you 're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course .
what to do instead ?
one : celebrate moral exemplars .
acknowledge , when you go to law school , that a little voice is whispering in your ear about atticus finch .
no 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .
people are inspired by moral heroes .
but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you ca n't acknowledge that you have moral heroes .
well , acknowledge them .
be proud that you have them .
celebrate them .
and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .
that 's one thing we can do .
i do n't know how many of you remember this : another moral hero , 15 years ago , aaron feuerstein , who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts — they made polartec — the factory burned down .
3,000 employees . he kept every one of them on the payroll .
why ? because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go .
`` `` '' maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street , but i can tell you it 's worth more . we 're doing fine . '' '' just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes . ''
two were particularly inspiring to me .
one was ray anderson , who turned — ( applause ) — turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint , or almost zero-footprint business .
why ? because it was the right thing to do .
and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
why ? because there happy to be doing something that 's the right thing to do .
yesterday we heard willie smits talk about re-foresting in indonesia .
( applause ) in many ways this is the perfect example .
because it took the will to do the right thing .
god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill .
i 'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out .
but most important to make it work — and he emphasized this — is that it took knowing the people in the communities .
unless the people you 're working with are behind you , this will fail .
and there is n't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you , because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways .
so there 's a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebrate .
and you do n't have to be a mega-hero .
there are ordinary heroes .
ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes .
as heads of organizations , we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will .
even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .
if you run an organization , you should be sure that none of the jobs — none of the jobs — have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors .
because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work .
and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .
and , perhaps most important , as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes , the moral exemplars , to the people we mentor .
and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers .
one is that we are always teaching .
someone is always watching .
the camera is always on .
`` bill gates talked about the importance of education and , in particular , the model that kipp was providing : `` knowledge is power . '' ''
and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college .
i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill did n't mention .
that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
they need to learn to respect their schoolmates .
they need to learn to respect their teachers .
and , most important , they need to learn to respect learning .
that 's the principle objective .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .
and the teachers : the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day .
obama appealed to virtue .
and i think he was right .
and the virtue i think we need above all others is practical wisdom , because it 's what allows other virtues — honesty , kindness , courage and so on — to be displayed at the right time and in the right way .
he also appealed to hope .
right again .
i think there is reason for hope .
i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
in many ways , it 's what ted is all about .
wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons .
this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention .
paying attention to what we do , to how we do it , and , perhaps most importantly , to the structure of the organizations within which we work , so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed .
thank you very much .
thank you .
( applause ) chris anderson : you have to go and stand out here a sec .
barry schwartz : thank you very much .
( applause )
all right , i want to see a show of hands : how many of you have unfriended someone on facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion , childcare , food ?
( laughter ) and how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just do n't want to talk to them ? ( laughter )
`` you know , it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation , we just had to follow the advice of henry higgins in `` '' my fair lady '' '' : stick to the weather and your health . ''
but these days , with climate change and anti-vaxxing , those subjects — ( laughter ) are not safe either .
so this world that we live in , this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument , where our politicians ca n't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it , it 's not normal .
pew research did a study of 10,000 american adults , and they found that at this moment , we are more polarized , we are more divided , than we ever have been in history .
we 're less likely to compromise , which means we 're not listening to each other .
and we make decisions about where to live , who to marry and even who our friends are going to be , based on what we already believe .
again , that means we 're not listening to each other .
a conversation requires a balance between talking and listening , and somewhere along the way , we lost that balance .
now , part of that is due to technology .
the smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly .
according to pew research , about a third of american teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day .
and many of them , almost most of them , are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face .
there 's this great piece in the atlantic .
it was written by a high school teacher named paul barnwell .
and he gave his kids a communication project .
he wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes .
`` and he said this : `` '' i came to realize ... '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach . ''
kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens , but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills .
`` it might sound like a funny question , but we have to ask ourselves : is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent , confident conversation ? '' '' now , i make my living talking to people : nobel prize winners , truck drivers , billionaires , kindergarten teachers , heads of state , plumbers . ''
i talk to people that i like . i talk to people that i do n't like .
i talk to some people that i disagree with deeply on a personal level .
but i still have a great conversation with them .
so i 'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen .
many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this , things like look the person in the eye , think of interesting topics to discuss in advance , look , nod and smile to show that you 're paying attention , repeat back what you just heard or summarize it .
so i want you to forget all of that .
it is crap .
( laughter ) there is no reason to learn how to show you 're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention . ( laughter )
( applause ) now , i actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that i do in regular life .
so , i 'm going to teach you how to interview people , and that 's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists .
learn to have a conversation without wasting your time , without getting bored , and , please god , without offending anybody .
we 've all had really great conversations .
we 've had them before . we know what it 's like .
the kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired , or where you feel like you 've made a real connection or you 've been perfectly understood .
there is no reason why most of your interactions ca n't be like that .
so i have 10 basic rules . i 'm going to walk you through all of them , but honestly , if you just choose one of them and master it , you 'll already enjoy better conversations .
number one : do n't multitask .
and i do n't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand .
i mean , be present .
be in that moment .
do n't think about your argument you had with your boss .
do n't think about what you 're going to have for dinner .
if you want to get out of the conversation , get out of the conversation , but do n't be half in it and half out of it .
number two : do n't pontificate .
if you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth , write a blog .
( laughter ) now , there 's a really good reason why i do n't allow pundits on my show : because they 're really boring .
if they 're conservative , they 're going to hate obama and food stamps and abortion .
if they 're liberal , they 're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and dick cheney .
totally predictable .
and you do n't want to be like that .
you need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn .
the famed therapist m. scott peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself .
and sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion .
he said that sensing this acceptance , the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener .
again , assume that you have something to learn .
`` bill nye : `` '' everyone you will ever meet knows something that you do n't . '' '' i put it this way : everybody is an expert in something . ''
number three : use open-ended questions .
in this case , take a cue from journalists .
start your questions with who , what , when , where , why or how .
if you put in a complicated question , you 're going to get a simple answer out .
`` if i ask you , `` '' were you terrified ? '' '' you 're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence , which is `` '' terrified , '' '' and the answer is `` '' yes , i was '' '' or `` '' no , i was n't . '' '' `` were you angry ? '' `` yes , i was very angry . '' ''
let them describe it . they 're the ones that know .
`` try asking them things like , `` '' what was that like ? '' '' `` how did that feel ? '' ''
because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it , and you 're going to get a much more interesting response .
number four : go with the flow .
that means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind .
we 've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere , or it 's already been answered .
that means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question , and he was just bound and determined to say that .
and we do the exact same thing .
we 're sitting there having a conversation with someone , and then we remember that time that we met hugh jackman in a coffee shop .
( laughter ) and we stop listening .
stories and ideas are going to come to you .
you need to let them come and let them go .
number five : if you do n't know , say that you do n't know .
now , people on the radio , especially on npr , are much more aware that they 're going on the record , and so they 're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure .
do that . err on the side of caution .
talk should not be cheap .
number six : do n't equate your experience with theirs .
if they 're talking about having lost a family member , do n't start talking about the time you lost a family member .
if they 're talking about the trouble they 're having at work , do n't tell them about how much you hate your job .
it 's not the same . it is never the same .
all experiences are individual .
and , more importantly , it is not about you .
you do n't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you 've suffered .
`` somebody asked stephen hawking once what his iq was , and he said , `` i have no idea . people who brag about their iqs are losers . '' ''
( laughter ) conversations are not a promotional opportunity .
number seven : try not to repeat yourself .
it 's condescending , and it 's really boring , and we tend to do it a lot .
especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids , we have a point to make , so we just keep rephrasing it over and over .
do n't do that .
number eight : stay out of the weeds .
frankly , people do n't care about the years , the names , the dates , all those details that you 're struggling to come up with in your mind .
they do n't care . what they care about is you .
they care about what you 're like , what you have in common .
so forget the details . leave them out .
number nine : this is not the last one , but it is the most important one .
listen .
i can not tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most , the number one most important skill that you could develop .
`` buddha said , and i 'm paraphrasing , `` if your mouth is open , you 're not learning . '' ''
`` and calvin coolidge said , `` '' no man ever listened his way out of a job . '' '' ( laughter ) why do we not listen to each other ? ''
number one , we 'd rather talk .
when i 'm talking , i 'm in control .
i do n't have to hear anything i 'm not interested in .
i 'm the center of attention .
i can bolster my own identity .
but there 's another reason : we get distracted .
the average person talks at about 225 word per minute , but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute .
so our minds are filling in those other 275 words .
and look , i know , it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone , but if you ca n't do that , you 're not in a conversation .
you 're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place .
( laughter ) you have to listen to one another .
stephen covey said it very beautifully .
`` he said , `` '' most of us do n't listen with the intent to understand . ''
`` we listen with the intent to reply . '' '' one more rule , number 10 , and it 's this one : be brief . ''
[ a good conversation is like a miniskirt ; short enough to retain interest , but long enough to cover the subject . — my sister ] ( laughter ) ( applause ) all of this boils down to the same basic concept , and it is this one : be interested in other people .
you know , i grew up with a very famous grandfather , and there was kind of a ritual in my home .
`` people would come over to talk to my grandparents , and after they would leave , my mother would come over to us , and she 'd say , `` '' do you know who that was ? ''
she was the runner-up to miss america .
he was the mayor of sacramento .
`` she won a pulitzer prize . he 's a russian ballet dancer . '' '' and i kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden , amazing thing about them . ''
and honestly , i think it 's what makes me a better host .
i keep my mouth shut as often as i possibly can , i keep my mind open , and i 'm always prepared to be amazed , and i 'm never disappointed .
you do the same thing .
go out , talk to people , listen to people , and , most importantly , be prepared to be amazed .
thanks .
( applause )
what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
the three of us take this class together .
women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
`` obviously . why are you even asking ? '' '' if you ask women why they did a good job , what they 'll say is someone helped them , they got lucky , they worked really hard . ''
boy , it matters a lot .
but it 's not that simple .
and he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students .
but that one word made a really big difference .
the bad news was that everyone liked howard .
this is the complication .
the data shows this very clearly .
that day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career .
sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ace , and 12.6 percent , one in eight , had four or more aces .
that 's what we do .
maybe it 's easier to see in other zip codes because we do n't want to look at it .
i would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs , but not the cyborgs that you think .
you 're not robocop , and you 're not terminator , but you 're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices .
so what 's a good definition for cyborg ?
`` well , traditional definition is `` '' an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments . '' '' that came from a 1960 paper on space travel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty awkward . ''
people are n't supposed to be there .
but humans are curious , and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next .
so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
`` somebody goes to another country , says , `` '' how fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curious their culture is . '' '' and then they write a paper , and maybe a few other anthropologists read it , and we think it 's very exotic . ''
well , what 's happening is that we 've suddenly found a new species .
`` i , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said , `` '' oh , wow . now suddenly we 're a new form of homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody 's doing around this technology . ''
`` they 're clicking on things and staring at screens . '' '' now there 's a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthropology . ''
and the reason is that tool use , in the beginning — for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modification of self .
it has helped us to extend our physical selves , go faster , hit things harder , and there 's been a limit on that .
but now what we 're looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we 're able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and the other thing that happens is that we 're all carrying around little mary poppins technology .
we can put anything we want into it , and it does n't get heavier , and then we can take anything out .
what does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
well , if you print it out , it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you 're carrying around all the time .
and if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something 's missing , except you are n't able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
the other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
whether you like it or not , you 're starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you 're not there .
and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open , which is basically your facebook wall , so that people do n't write on it in the middle of the night — because it 's very much the equivalent .
and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life .
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
and the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adolescents , have to go through two adolescences .
they have to go through their primary one , that 's already awkward , and then they go through their second self 's adolescence , and that 's even more awkward because there 's an actual history of what they 've gone through online .
and anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now , and so it 's very awkward , and it 's very difficult for them to do those things .
`` so when i was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , `` i 'm going to teach you about time and space in the future . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' great . '' '' and he said one day , `` '' what 's the shortest distance between two points ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , that 's a straight line . you told me that yesterday . '' '' i thought i was very clever . ''
`` he said , `` '' no , no , no . here 's a better way . '' '' he took a piece of paper , drew a and b on one side and the other and folded them together so where a and b touched . ''
`` and he said , `` '' that is the shortest distance between two points . '' '' and i said , `` '' dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? '' '' he said , `` '' well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that 's just how you do it . '' '' and i said , `` '' i want to do that . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , okay . '' '' and so , when i went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years , i was thinking at night , `` '' i want to be the first person to create a wormhole , to make things accelerate faster . ''
`` and i want to make a time machine . '' '' i was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders . ''
but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology does n't just get adopted because it works .
it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans .
so i started studying anthropology .
and when i was writing my thesis on cell phones , i realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets .
they were n't physically transporting themselves ; they were mentally transporting themselves .
they would click on a button , and they would be connected as a to b immediately .
`` and i thought , `` '' oh , wow . i found it . this is great . '' '' so over time , time and space have compressed because of this . ''
you can stand on one side of the world , whisper something and be heard on the other .
one of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use .
every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
and because of that , you start to dig around for your external memories — where did you leave them ?
so now we 're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we 've lost on our external brains that we 're carrying around in our pockets .
`` and that incites a sort of panic architecture — `` oh no , where 's this thing ? '' ''
`` we 're all `` '' i love lucy '' '' on a great assembly line of information , and we ca n't keep up . ''
and so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up checking our phones all the time .
so we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
it 's not that we 're always connected to everybody , but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want .
and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone , the room would be very crowded .
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general — all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
and so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
one i 'm really worried about is that people are n't taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they are n't slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
they 're not just sitting there .
and really , when you have no external input , that is a time when there is a creation of self , when you can do long-term planning , when you can try and figure out who you really are .
and then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in — and oh , i have to do this , and i have to do this , and i have to do this .
and so this is very important .
i 'm really worried that , especially kids today , they 're not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
so if you think about it , the world has n't stopped either .
it has its own external prosthetic devices , and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other .
but when you actually visualize it , all the connections that we 're doing right now — this is an image of the mapping of the internet — it does n't look technological .
it actually looks very organic .
this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we 've connected in this way .
and it 's not that machines are taking over .
it 's that they 're helping us to be more human , helping us to connect with each other .
the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives .
and really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we 're co-creating each other all the time .
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it 's still a human connection — it 's just done in a different way .
we 're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography .
so that 's why i study cyborg anthropology .
thank you .
( applause )
why grow homes ? because we can .
right now , america is in an unremitting state of trauma .
and there 's a cause for that , all right .
we 've got mcpeople , mccars , mchouses .
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
so what 's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses ?
well , it 's been around for 2,500 years .
it 's called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .
we use cnc to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter , plants , into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a fab tree hab .
it fits into the environment . it is the environment .
it is the landscape , right ?
and you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it 's great because they suck carbon .
they 're perfect .
you can have 100 million families , or take things out of the suburbs , because these are homes that are a part of the environment .
imagine pre-growing a village — it takes about seven to 10 years — and everything is green .
so not only do we do the veggie house , we also do the in-vitro meat habitat , or homes that we 're doing research on now in brooklyn , where , as an architecture office , we 're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one .
so we 've been doing this for a couple of years , and that 's our lab .
and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
we use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like , you know , shoes , leather belts , handbags , etc. , where no sentient creature is harmed .
it 's victimless . it 's meat from a test tube .
so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes .
so here is a typical stud wall , an architectural construction , and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house , where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation , cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows .
( laughter ) and we know it 's incredibly ugly .
it could have been an english tudor or spanish colonial , but we kind of chose this shape .
and there it is kind of grown , at least one particular section of it .
we had a big show in prague , and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat .
that 's why we grow homes . thanks very much .
( applause )
you all know the truth of what i 'm going to say .
what 's changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does .
i 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i 'm going to be showing you exist .
but first , see what a miserable lot we are .
( laughter ) i want to start though with a paradox .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income — how rich countries are on average .
and you see the countries on the right , like norway and the usa , are twice as rich as israel , greece , portugal on the left .
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
there 's no suggestion of a relationship there .
but if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society .
this , again , is life expectancy .
these are small areas of england and wales — the poorest on the right , the richest on the left .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .
so income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them .
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we 're looking at relative income or social position , social status — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
and as soon as you 've got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ?
and that 's what i 'm going to show you .
i 'm not using any hypothetical data .
i 'm taking data from the u.n. — it 's the same as the world bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
the measure we 've used , because it 's easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country .
and you see in the more equal countries on the left — japan , finland , norway , sweden — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent .
but on the more unequal end — u.k. , portugal , usa , singapore — the differences are twice as big .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
now i 'm going to show you what that does to our societies .
we put them all in one index .
they 're all weighted equally .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
it 's an extraordinarily close correlation .
but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita , gross national income , there 's nothing there , no correlation anymore .
we were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence , so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well-being .
it has 40 different components put together by other people .
it contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there 's bullying at school .
everything goes into it .
here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
highly significant relationship .
but once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in relation to national income per person , there 's no relationship , no suggestion of a relationship .
what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing .
the average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth .
that 's very important in poorer countries , but not in the rich developed world .
but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .
i 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .
here , for instance , is trust .
it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
it comes from the world values survey .
you see , at the more unequal end , it 's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others .
but in the more equal societies , it rises to 60 or 65 percent .
and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital , very similar relationships closely related to inequality .
i may say , we did all this work twice .
we did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 american states — asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?
so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
same thing is going on .
basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed .
we 're not just talking about a fluke .
this is mental illness .
who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .
this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year .
and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .
and again , closely related to inequality .
this is violence .
these red dots are american states , and the blue triangles are canadian provinces .
but look at the scale of the differences .
it goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
this is the proportion of the population in prison .
there 's a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
in some places , that 's part of it .
here we have children dropping out of high school .
extraordinarily damaging , if you 're talking about using the talents of the population .
this is social mobility .
it 's actually a measure of mobility based on income .
basically , it 's asking : do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons , or is there no relationship between the two ?
and at the more unequal end , fathers ' income is much more important — in the u.k. , usa .
and in scandinavian countries , fathers ' income is much less important .
there 's more social mobility .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i 've shown you just a few things in italics here .
i could have shown a number of other problems .
they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .
but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .
so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality .
it 's not just one or two things that go wrong , it 's most things .
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , sweden and japan , they 're very different countries in all sorts of ways .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
sweden has huge differences in earnings , and it narrows the gap through taxation , general welfare state , generous benefits and so on .
japan is rather different though .
it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
it has lower taxes .
it has a smaller welfare state .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
there are some states that do well through redistribution , some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax .
i am not talking about perfect equality , i 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies .
`` but then where it says `` '' low social class , '' '' that 's unskilled manual occupations . ''
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
but i should say a few words about what 's going on .
i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
it also leads to status insecurity .
we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others , whether we 're regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing .
the social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
now we have been criticized .
of course , there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising .
we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at , it goes into the analysis .
our data source decides whether it 's reliable data , we do n't .
otherwise that would introduce bias .
what about other countries ?
there are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .
this is n't confined to these countries here , hiding a very simple demonstration .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
why do n't we control for other factors ?
well we 've shown you that gnp per capita does n't make any difference .
and of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
what about causality ?
correlation in itself does n't prove causality .
we spend a good bit of time .
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .
the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system , the cardiovascular system .
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
we 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies , and that 's exciting .
thank you .
( applause )
i grew up in northern ireland , right up in the very , very north end of it there , where it 's absolutely freezing cold .
this was me running around in the back garden mid-summer .
( laughter ) i could n't pick a career .
in ireland the obvious choice is the military , but to be honest it actually kind of sucks .
( laughter ) my mother wanted me to be a dentist .
but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
and this was a pretty common sight .
the school i went to was pretty boring .
they forced us to learn things like latin .
the school teachers were n't having much fun , the sports were very dirty or very painful .
so i cleverly chose rowing , which i got very good at .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
and that was the finishing post right there .
( laughter ) so this was extremely embarrassing .
but our school at that time got a grant from the government , and they got an incredible computer — the research machine 3dz — and they left the programming manuals lying around .
and so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it .
also around this time , at home , this was the computer that people were buying .
it was called the sinclair zx80 . this was a 1k computer , and you 'd buy your programs on cassette tape .
actually i 'm just going to pause for one second , because i heard that there 's a prerequisite to speak here at ted — you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair .
so i brought a picture with big hair .
( laughter ) .
i just want to get that out of the way .
so after the sinclair zx80 came along the very cleverly named sinclair zx81 .
( laughter ) and — you see the picture at the bottom ?
there 's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son .
that 's what they thought they had built it for .
the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
we were programming in basic , which is a pretty awful language for games , so we ended up learning assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware .
this is the guy that invented it , sir clive sinclair , and he 's showing his machine .
you had this same thing in america , it was called the timex sinclair1000 .
`` to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing `` '' battlestar galactica . '' '' the graphics were just horrible . ''
`` you had to have an even better imagination to play this game , `` death rider . '' ''
but of course the scientists could n't help themselves .
they started making their own video games .
this is one of my favorite ones here , where they have rabbit breeding , so males choose the lucky rabbit .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
and if you 're wondering how much 16k is , this ebay logo here is 16k .
and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program .
and that 's what it looked like .
i spent ages flying this flight simulator , and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it .
here 's clive sinclair now launching his color computer .
he 's recognized as being the father of video games in europe .
he 's a multi-millionaire , and i think that 's why he 's smiling in this photograph .
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
`` some of the highlights were things like `` '' the terminator , '' '' `` aladdin , '' the `` teenage mutant hero turtles . '' ''
because i was from the united kingdom , they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children , so they decided to call it hero instead .
`` i personally preferred the spanish version , which was `` '' tortugas ninja . '' '' that was much better . ''
( laughter ) then the last game i did was based on trying to get the video game industry and hollywood to actually work together on something — instead of licensing from each other , to actually work .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i 've done that .
the video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business .
it grows every year .
last year was the biggest year .
by 2008 , we 're going to kick the butt of the music industry .
by 2010 , we 're going to hit 42 billion .
43 percent of gamers are female .
so there 's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware .
the average age of gamers ?
well , obviously it 's for children , right ?
well , no , actually it 's 30 years old .
and interestingly , the people who buy the most games are 37 .
so 37 is our target audience .
all video games are violent .
of course the newspapers love to beat on this .
but 83 percent of games do n't have any mature content whatsoever , so it 's just not true .
online gaming statistics .
`` i brought some stuff on `` '' world of warcraft . '' '' it 's 5.5 million players . ''
it makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions .
it costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer , making the publisher about another 275 million .
the game costs about 80 million dollars to make , so basically it pays for itself in about a month .
`` a player in a game called `` '' project entropia '' '' actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars . ''
you have to remember that this is not a real island .
he did n't actually buy anything , just some data .
but he got great terms on it .
this purchase included mining and hunting rights , ownership of all land on the island , and a castle with no furniture included .
( laughter ) this market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
and what 's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves .
they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games .
i dove onto ebay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on , typed in world of warcraft , got 6,000 items .
i liked this one the best : a level 60 warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars .
it 's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it .
so as far as popularity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
it turns out they 're actually in hollywood bowl in los angeles listening to the l.a. philharmonic playing video game music .
that 's what the show looks like .
you would expect it to be cheesy , but it 's not .
it 's very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
and the people that went there absolutely loved it .
what do you think these people are doing ?
they 're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other .
and this is happening in every city around the world .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
now , chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving .
i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .
but what i want you to do is to try to understand it .
we 're on this curve , and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better .
and i 'm going to show you up to maybe 2007 .
but i want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now .
so we 're going to start that video .
video : throughout human history people have played games .
as man 's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays .
( music ) ( applause ) david perry : the thing again i want you to think about is , do n't look at these graphics and think of that 's the way it is .
think about that 's where we are right now , and the curve that we 're on means that this is going to continue to get better .
this is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today .
you need to be really an incredible artist .
and once we get enough of those guys , we 're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we 've never been to before , or characters that we 've just never seen before .
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
but if you were to go to a game developers conference , what they 're all talking about is emotion , purpose , meaning , understanding and feeling .
you 'll hear about talks like , can a video game make you cry ?
and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about .
i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
so i 'd like to play this video .
so this is a student 's opinion on what his experience of games are .
video : i , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
some part of me — a true living , breathing person — has become programmed , electronic and virtual .
the boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble .
i 'm a video game addict and this is my story .
( music ) in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
i played in the backyard , learned to read , and even ate some of my vegetables .
most of my childhood was spent playing with legos .
but as was the case for most of my generation , i spent a lot of time in front of the tv .
mr. rogers , walt disney , nick junior , and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me .
when my parents bought my sister and i our first nintendo , whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me .
at some point something clicked .
( music ) with the combination of simple , interactive stories and the warmth of the tv set , my simple 16-bit nintendo became more than just an escape .
it became an alternate existence , my virtual reality .
( music ) i 'm a video game addict , and it 's not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
it is because i have had life-altering experiences in virtual space , and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not .
i 'm addicted , because even though i know i 'm losing my grip on reality , i still crave more .
( music ) from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen .
today , after 20 years of watching tv geared to make me emotional , even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes .
i am just one of a new generation that is growing up .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
video games are nearing an evolutionary leap , a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres , or the news we watch on tv .
and while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited , what i do learn applies to my real life .
play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard , fly a plane , drive a nine-second quarter mile , or kill a man .
i know i can .
unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it , video games actually allow us to become part of the machine .
they allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive , downloaded , streaming , hd reality .
we are interacting with our entertainment .
i have come to expect this level of interaction .
without it , the problems faced in the real world — poverty , war , disease and genocide — lack the levity they should .
their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv .
but the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics , the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound .
it lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional .
i have fought in wars , feared for my own survival , watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story .
the people who create these games are smart .
they know what makes me scared , excited , panicked , proud or sad .
then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create .
a well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away .
i know what i want and i do it .
no buttons to push , no triggers to pull , just me and the game .
my fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands .
i know violent video games make my mother worry .
what troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence , but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game .
( music ) these are all troubles outside of myself .
i , however , have a problem very close to home .
something has happened to my brain .
( music ) perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts , the things we know to do before we even think .
while some of these instincts may be innate , most are learned , and all of them are hardwired into our brains .
these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds .
only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli .
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life , only virtually .
consider this — my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it .
in all my driving games , i 've driven a total of 31,459 miles .
to some degree i 've learned how to drive from the game .
the sensory cues are very similar .
it 's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv than you have in real life .
when i am driving down a road at sunset all i can think is , this is almost as beautiful as my games are .
for my virtual worlds are perfect .
more beautiful and rich than the real world around us .
i 'm not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me .
today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply tvs .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming .
but maybe brainwashing is n't always bad .
imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other , or helps us to understand the problems we 're all facing in the real world .
there is a potential to do good as well .
it is critical , as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in , that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them .
i 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .
but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do .
what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics , sound , game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me .
i know that i am losing my grip .
part of me is just waiting to let go .
i know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how flat the real world may seem to us , that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug .
( applause ) dp : wow . ( applause )
i found that video very , very thought provoking , and that 's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see .
and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio .
but as you heard , michael talked about all these other elements as well .
video games give an awful lot of other things too , and that 's why people get so addicted .
the most important one being fun .
`` the name of this track is `` '' the magic to come . '' '' who is that going to come from ? ''
is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would ?
i do n't think so .
i think it 's going to come from the children who are growing up now that are n't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past .
they 're going to do it their way , using the tools that we 've created .
the same with students or highly creative people , writers and people like that .
as far as colleges go , there 's about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
that means there 's literally thousands of new ideas .
some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great .
there 's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea .
( laughter ) chris anderson : you 're off , you 're off . that 's it .
he 's out of time .
dp : i 've just got a little tiny bit more if you 'll indulge me .
ca : go ahead . i 'm going to stay right here though .
( laughter ) dp : this is just a cool shot , because this is students coming to school after class .
the school is closed ; they 're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas .
i 'm sitting at the front of the class , and they 're actually pitching their ideas .
so it 's hard to get students to come back to class , but it is possible .
this is my daughter , her name 's emma , she 's 17 months old .
and i 've been asking myself , what is emma going to experience in the video game world ?
and as i 've shown here , we have the audience .
she 's never going to know a world where you ca n't press a button and have millions of people ready to play .
you know , we have the technology .
she 's never going to know a world where the graphics just are n't stunning and really immersive .
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
she 's never going to know a world where video games are n't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry .
i just hope she likes video games .
( laughter ) so , my closing thought .
games on the surface seem simple entertainment , but for those that like to look a little deeper , the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big .
where better to challenge those minds than here at ted ?
thank you .
chris anderson : david perry . that was awesome .
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
they 've been here for billions of years , and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms .
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna .
they have very few genes , and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
they just grow and divide , and grow and divide — so a kind of boring life , except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters .
i know you guys think of yourself as humans , and this is sort of how i think of you .
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
so , 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .
and of course it 's the dna that counts , so here 's all the a , t , gs and cs that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics .
you have about 30,000 genes .
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
at the best , you 're 10 percent human , but more likely about one percent human , depending on which of these metrics you like .
i know you think of yourself as human beings , but i think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial .
( laughter ) these bacteria are not passive riders , these are incredibly important , they keep us alive .
they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy .
they digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .
so , there 's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
and so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do .
i mean they 're incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one .
they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide , and they 've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms .
and so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .
the clue to this came from another marine bacterium , and it 's a bacterium called vibrio fischeri .
what you 're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named vibrio fischeri .
this bacterium has the special property that it makes light , so it makes bioluminescence , like fireflies make light .
we 're not doing anything to the cells here .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they 're alone , and times when they 're in a community , and then all do something together .
this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
when it 's alone it does n't make any light .
that 's how bioluminescence works — they 're talking with these chemical words .
the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .
the squid is nocturnal , so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps , but then at night it has to come out to hunt .
on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it 's just in those couple feet of water .
what the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria .
then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back .
( laughter ) but then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem because it 's got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it ca n't sustain that .
now the bacteria are dilute , that little hormone molecule is gone , so they 're not making light — but of course the squid does n't care . it 's asleep in the sand .
and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule .
these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
when the molecule increases to a certain amount — which says something about the number of cells — it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .
why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous , glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean — all bacteria have systems like this .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
they make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
we have a fancy name for this : we call it quorum sensing .
they vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote .
what 's important for today 's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .
but the one that 's probably the most important to you is virulence .
it 's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins — you 're enormous , that would have no effect on you . you 're huge .
bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .
we also then went to look at what are these molecules — these were the red triangles on my slides before .
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule .
this is the word that it talks with .
so then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we 've discovered .
what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related .
the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
so these are private , secret conversations .
these conversations are for intraspecies communication .
each bacteria uses a particular molecule that 's its language that allows it to count its own siblings .
and that 's depicted on this slide . this is your skin .
so this is just a picture — a micrograph of your skin .
and so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria , and it 's about counting your neighbors , it 's not enough to be able to only talk within your species .
so , they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor , and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria .
it 's used by all different bacteria and it 's the language of interspecies communication .
what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you .
they take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population .
it 's a very small , five-carbon molecule .
so they 're all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
this is the bacterial esperanto .
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well .
of course , i 've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing .
could n't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
of course , you 've just heard and you already know that we 're running out of antibiotics .
bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now , and that 's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .
they either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it ca n't replicate its dna .
and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .
and so that 's exactly what we 've done , and we 've sort of taken two strategies .
the first one is we 've targeted the intraspecies communication system .
so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules — which you saw — but they 're a little bit different .
we 've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we 've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria .
to finish i 'll just show you the strategy .
in this one i 'm just using the interspecies molecule , but the logic is exactly the same .
what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal , in this case , a mouse , it does n't initiate virulence right away .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
what we 've been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules — so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they 're a little bit different which i 've depicted on this slide .
what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium — a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium — in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
so in the spirit of ted they 're doing things together because it makes a difference .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity .
we think , by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
i hope that what you 've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
the final thing is , again just to reiterate that there 's this practical part , and so we 've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
what we 're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you , in the hopes of making you more healthy , making those conversations better , so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .
i keep getting older and older and they 're always the same age , and it 's just a crazy delightful job .
i want to thank you for inviting me here .
it 's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
well , i 'm an ocean chemist .
the overall features are extremely easy to understand .
the polar regions are cold because there 's less sunlight .
so we 're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this .
you 're probably seeing new species .
to do that , we need to charter a research boat .
great , if you 're not a great mariner .
sometimes it looks a little more like this .
this is a swimming holothurian — it 's a small sea slug , basically .
this is a beautiful holothurian as well .
and this animal you 're going to see coming up was a big surprise .
this was n't what we were looking for .
you 're going to see a picture of one in a moment .
an organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years .
this is what makes me really unpopular with my research team .
so i want to leave you with this last slide .
it 's just a beautiful place .
this device consists of a large , round table and some machinery .
when the woman is ready to deliver her child , she lies on her back , she is strapped down to the table , and the table is rotated at high speed .
the child comes flying out through centrifugal force .
and it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains , we being human beings , true , have our brains packaged .
they , the woodpeckers , typically will peck , they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day . every day !
and as far as anyone knows , that does n't bother them in the slightest .
their brain does not slosh around like ours does .
their brain is packed in very tightly , at least for blows coming right from the front .
and the woodpecker maybe relates to that .
the man had cut his finger , he worked processing chickens , and then he started to smell really , really bad .
it was intolerable .
they tried every drug , every other treatment they could think of .
after two years , still smelled putrid .
after five years , it went away on its own .
it 's a mystery .
in new zealand , dr. lianne parkin and her team tested an old tradition in her city .
they live in a city that has huge hills , san francisco-grade hills .
and in the winter there , it gets very cold and very icy .
there are lots of injuries .
the tradition that they tested , they tested by asking people who were on their way to work in the morning , to stop and try something out .
try one of two conditions .
the tradition is that in the winter , in that city , you wear your socks on the outside of your boots .
and what they discovered by experiment , and it was quite graphic when they saw it , was that it 's true .
that if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside , you 're much more likely to survive and not slip and fall .
in 1991 , i , together with bunch of other people , started the ig nobel prize ceremony .
every year we give out 10 prizes .
the prizes are based on just one criteria . it 's very simple .
it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think .
what you 've done makes people laugh and then think .
whatever it is , there 's something about it that when people encounter it at first , their only possible reaction is to laugh .
that 's the quality we look for .
every year , we get in the neighborhood of 9,000 new nominations for the ig nobel prize .
of those , consistently between 10 percent and 20 percent of those nominations are people who nominate themselves .
those self-nominees almost never win .
even if you do n't want to , it 's very difficult numerically .
you should know that when we choose somebody to win an ig nobel prize , we get in touch with that person , very quietly .
we offer them the chance to decline this great honor if they want to .
happily for us , almost everyone who 's offered a prize decides to accept .
what do you get if you win an ig nobel prize ?
well , you get several things .
you get an ig nobel prize .
the design is different every year .
these are always handmade from extremely cheap materials .
you 're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year , 2013 .
most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash , some money .
we do n't have any money , so we ca n't give them .
in fact , the winners have to pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony , which most of them do .
last year , though , we did manage to scrape up some money .
last year , each of the 10 ig nobel prize winners received from us 10 trillion dollars .
a $ 10 trillion bill from zimbabwe . ( laughter ) you may remember that zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation .
they ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars .
the man responsible , who runs the national bank there , by the way , won an ig nobel prize in mathematics .
it fits 1,100 people , it 's jammed to the gills , and up on the stage , waiting to shake your hand , waiting to hand you your ig nobel prize , are a bunch of nobel prize winners .
that 's the heart of the ceremony .
the winners are kept secret until that moment , even the nobel laureates who will shake their hand do n't know who they are until they 're announced .
i am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical-related prizes we 've given .
keep in mind , we 've given 230 prizes .
there are lots of these people who walk among you .
maybe you have one .
`` a paper was published about 30 years ago called `` '' injuries due to falling coconuts . '' '' it was written by dr. peter barss , who is canadian . ''
dr. barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor , he wanted to see the world .
so he went to papua new guinea .
one typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands , where there are not many coconut trees , down to visit their relatives on the coast , where there are lots .
and they 'll think that a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down .
a coconut tree that is 90 feet tall , and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time .
a team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies .
you 're all familiar with colonoscopies , one way or another .
or in some cases , one way and another .
and there were some difficulties at first .
the basic problem , i 'm sure you 're familiar with , that you 're looking inside a long , narrow , dark place .
and so , you want to have a larger space .
you add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around .
now , that 's added to the gas , the methane gas , that 's already inside .
the gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
so they added oxygen to methane gas .
so you had methane gas , which is flammable , oxygen and heat .
one to save your life , one to save the life of some lucky bystander . ( laughter ) why would someone do this , you might wonder .
dr. bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that she grew up in ukraine .
and they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in .
years later , she moved to america .
she had a baby , one day she looked , and on the floor , her infant son had picked up her bra , and had her bra on his face .
and that 's where the idea came from .
thank you .
( applause )
okay , religious mania : there 's rapture , there 's weeping , there 's visions .
manias can be good .
a mania for learning english .
t : i do n't ever want to let my country down !
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
how many people are trying to learn english worldwide ?
imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
t : i want to speak perfect english !
s ( yelling more loudly ) : i want to change my life !
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ?
the world has other universal languages .
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
because i was new to the city , i did n't have access to a stage , so i decided to create my own in public places .
so the first project we 're going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride .
now this took place in january of 2002 .
and this woman is the star of the video .
she does n't know she 's being filmed .
she 's being filmed with a hidden camera .
this is on the 6 train in new york city .
and this is the first stop along the line .
these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
and that 's me right there in a brown coat .
it 's about 30 degrees outside .
i 'm wearing a hat . i 'm wearing a scarf .
and the girl 's going to notice me right here .
( laughter ) and as you 'll see now , i 'm not wearing pants . ( laughter )
so at this point — at this point she 's noticed me , but in new york there 's weirdos on any given train car .
one person 's not that unusual .
`` she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled `` '' rape . '' '' ( laughter ) so she 's noticed the unusual thing , but she 's gone back to her normal life . ''
now in the meantime , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
they 're going to be entering this car one by one .
we 'll act as though we do n't know each other .
and we 'll act as if it 's just an unfortunate mistake we 've made , forgetting our pants on this cold january day .
( laughter ) so at this point , she decides to put the rape book away . ( laughter )
and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
now in the meantime , the two danish guys to the left of the camera , they 're cracking up .
they think this is the funniest thing they 've ever seen before .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
( laughter ) and i love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
( laughter ) so the video wo n't show everything .
this goes on for another four stops .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
`` we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , `` '' thank you . that 's exactly what i needed today , '' '' and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions . ''
( applause ) thank you .
so that 's a still from the video there .
and i love that girl 's reaction so much .
and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do .
and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
it 's a prank , but it 's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride .
and we 've continued to do it every year .
this january , we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in new york — almost every single train line in the city .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
( laughter ) as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
so i could do more large-scale projects .
well one day i was walking through union square , and i saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
and it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back-lit with florescent lighting , and she was very much onstage , and i could n't figure out why she was doing it .
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared — she had been hiding behind a display — and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this .
so i got inspired by that .
looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows — and i knew what i had to do .
( laughter ) so this project is called look up more . we had 70 actors dress in black .
this was completely unauthorized .
we did n't let the stores know we were coming .
and i stood in the park giving signals .
`` the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out `` '' look up more , '' '' the name of the project . ''
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together .
you 'll see that start right here .
( laughter ) and then we had dancing . we had everyone dance .
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
( laughter ) so then i gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 , and he danced .
there were several other activities .
we had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
there 's a better photo of it .
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
`` a high school kid in texas wrote me in 2006 and said , `` '' you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , `` '' yes , you are correct . ''
`` i think i 'll try to do that this weekend . thank you . '' '' so here 's the video . ''
so again , this is 2005 .
this is the best buy in new york city .
we had about 80 people show up to participate , entering one-by-one .
there was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
so a very diverse group of people .
`` and i told people , `` '' do n't work . do n't actually do work . ''
but also , do n't shop .
`` just stand around and do n't face products . '' '' now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt . ''
everybody else is one of our actors .
( laughter ) the lower level employees thought it was very funny .
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
the managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
you can see them in this footage .
they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
( laughter ) so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
and you can see the cops in this footage right here .
that 's a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
so i like that concept of using their own technology against them .
( laughter ) i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
and one morning , i was riding the subway .
i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st. stop where there are these two giant escalators .
and it 's a very depressing place to be in the morning , it 's very crowded .
so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
so this was in the winter of 2009 — 8:30 in the morning .
it 's morning rush hour .
it 's very cold outside .
people are coming in from queens , transferring from the e train to the 6 train .
and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you .
so there 's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
he gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
`` so i 'd say over the years , one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is : `` '' these people have too much time on their hands . '' '' and you know , not everybody 's going to like everything you do , and i 've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments , but that one 's always bothered me , because we do n't have too much time on our hands . ''
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
you know , every saturday and sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
`` and i 've never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , `` '' all those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . '' '' and of course they do n't . ''
it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library .
( laughter ) or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire .
you know , as kids , we 're taught to play .
and we 're never given a reason why we should play .
it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing .
and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere .
it 's that there is no point and that there does n't have to be a point .
we do n't need a reason .
as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that 's enough for us .
and i think , as adults , we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play .
thank you very much .
( applause )
so i 'm a neurosurgeon .
and like most of my colleagues , i have to deal , every day , with human tragedies .
i realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident .
and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body , the brain has very little ability for self-repair .
and after a major injury of your central nervous system , the patients often remain with a severe handicap .
and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon .
what is a functional neurosurgeon ?
it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies .
you 've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation , where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function .
it 's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease , with severe tremor , with severe pain .
however , neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair .
and the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain .
i think that we are approaching this dream .
and i would like to show you that we are very close to this .
and that with a little bit of help , the brain is able to help itself .
so the story started 15 years ago .
at that time , i was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room .
i often had to take care of patients with head trauma .
you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he 's increasing his intracranial pressure .
and in order to save his life , you have to decrease this intracranial pressure .
and to do that , you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain .
so instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain , we decided with jean-françois brunet , who is a colleague of mine , a biologist , to study them .
what do i mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue .
it 's not an easy task .
growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family .
so you need to find the right nutrients , the warmth , the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive .
so that 's exactly what we had to do with these cells .
and after many attempts , jean-françois did it .
and that 's what he saw under his microscope .
and that was , for us , a major surprise .
why ?
because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture , with large green cells surrounding small , immature cells .
and you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells , able to turn into any type of cell of the body .
the adult brain has stem cells , but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain .
and there was another intriguing observation : regular stem cells are very active cells — cells that divide , divide , divide very quickly .
and they never die , they 're immortal cells .
they divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently .
and it took us a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells .
all of you have them in your brain .
they represent four percent of your cortical brain cells .
they have a very important role during the development stage .
when you were fetuses , they helped your brain to fold itself .
but why do they stay in your head ?
this , we do n't know .
but it 's not so sure .
but there is one clear thing — that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture .
and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain .
and we had to prove this .
so to prove it , we decided to design an experimental paradigm .
the idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain , and then to culture the cells exactly the way jean-françois did it in his lab .
and then label them , to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain .
and the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual .
we call these autologous grafts — autografts .
`` so the first question we had , `` '' what will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain , and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain ? '' '' thanks to the help of professor eric rouiller , we worked with monkeys . ''
so in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second-case scenario , we performed the lesion , we re-implanted exactly the same cells , and in this case , the cells remained — and they became mature neurons .
and that 's the image of what we could observe under the microscope .
those are the cells that were re-implanted .
and the proof they carry , these little spots , those are the cells that we 've labeled in vitro , when they were in culture .
but we could not stop here , of course .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion ?
so for that , we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task .
they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray .
they were very good at it .
and when they had reached a plateau of performance , we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion .
so the monkeys were plegic , they could not move their hand anymore .
and exactly the same as humans would do , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , exactly the same as after a stroke .
patients are completely plegic , and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism , they recover to a certain extent , exactly the same for the monkey .
so when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery , we implanted his own cells .
so on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
he 's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
and look now when we re-implant the cells : two months after re-implantation , the same individual .
( applause ) it was also very exciting results for us , i tell you .
since that time , we 've understood much more about these cells .
we know that we can cryopreserve them , we can use them later on .
we know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models , like parkinson 's disease , for example .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
and i really hope that i 'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself .
thank you .
`` ( applause ) bruno giussani : jocelyne , this is amazing , and i 'm sure that right now , there are several dozen people in the audience , possibly even a majority , who are thinking , `` '' i know somebody who can use this . '' '' i do , in any case . ''
and of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ?
jocelyne bloch : the biggest obstacles are regulations . ( laughs ) so , from these exciting results , you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials .
bg : which is understandable , the brain is delicate , etc .
jb : yes , it is , but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it , you know ?
jb : so , it 's very difficult to say .
it depends , first , on the approval of the trial .
will the regulation allow us to do it soon ?
and then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .
so it takes , already , a long time to select the patients , do the treatment and evaluate if it 's useful to do this kind of treatment .
and then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .
you have to really prove first that it 's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody .

this is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
( music ) ( video ) narrator : on this planet , 1.6 billion people do n't have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels .
this is a problem .
it impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life .
so here 's the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that does n't use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables .
time for some thermodynamics .
and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator .
adam grosser : so 29 years ago , i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
it 's one of those things that stuck in my head .
it was a lot like the stirling engine : it was cool , but you did n't know what to do with it .
and it was invented in 1858 , by this guy ferdinand carre , but he could n't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
this crazy canadian named powel crosley commercialized this thing called the icyball in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and i 'll get to why it did n't work , but here 's how it works .
there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance .
one has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
you heat up one side , the hot side .
the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
you let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
so , it was a great idea that did n't work at all : it blew up .
because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
it topped 400 psi . the ammonia was toxic . it sprayed everywhere .
but it was kind of an interesting thought .
so , the great thing about 2006 is there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do .
so , we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
we found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
brought in a team from the u.k. — there 's a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the u.k. — and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
so , this is the way it works .
you put it on a cooking fire .
most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it 's camel dung or wood .
it heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it 's not quite done .
weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
you put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing — three degrees above freezing — for 24 hours in a 30 degree c environment . it 's really cheap .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
thank you .
( applause )
so my name is taylor wilson .
i am 17 years old and i am a nuclear physicist , which may be a little hard to believe , but i am .
and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point , that the bridge that t. boone pickens talked about will get us to .
so nuclear fusion is our energy future .
and the second point , making the case that kids can really change the world .
so you may ask — ( applause ) you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old .
that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
i decided i wanted to make a star .
now most of you are probably saying , well there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion .
i do n't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy .
well it does n't break even .
it does n't produce more energy out than i put in , but it still does some pretty cool stuff .
and i assembled this in my garage , and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada , reno .
and it slams together deuterium , which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it .
so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun .
and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together , and in the process it has some byproducts , and i utilize those byproducts .
so this previous year , i won the intel international science and engineering fair .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
for hundreds of dollars , i 've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars .
i built this in my garage .
( applause ) and i 've developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities i 've developed a device that , on a very small scale , can produce these isotopes .
so that 's my fusion reactor in the background there .
that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
oh , by the way , i make yellowcake in my garage , so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians .
so maybe i do n't want to admit to that .
this is me at cern in geneva , switzerland , which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world .
and this is me with president obama , showing him my homeland security research .
`` ( applause ) so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a `` '' star in a jar , '' '' a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too . ''
so thank you very much .
( applause )
so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that does n't exist .
so what we proposed was , let 's create a new body .
and he just got it right , and now he starts walking .
they have to move an arm in three dimensions .
it 's simply impossible .
the second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex , or a different pulse , two different pulses .
moderator : wow . okay , that 's where we are going .
a few years ago , i got one of those spam emails .
and it managed to get through my spam filter .
i 'm not quite sure how , but it turned up in my inbox , and it was from a guy called solomon odonkoh .
`` it went like this : it said , `` '' hello james veitch , i have an interesting business proposal i want to share with you , solomon . '' '' now , my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button , right ? ''
i was looking at my phone . i thought , i could just delete this .
or i could do what i think we 've all always wanted to do .
`` he said , `` '' dear james veitch , we shall be shipping gold to you . '' '' ( laughter ) `` you will earn 10 % of any gold you distributes . '' ( laughter ) ''
so i knew i was dealing with a professional . ( laughter )
`` i said , `` '' how much is it worth ? '' '' he said , `` '' we will start with smaller quantity , '' '' — i was like , aww — and then he said , `` '' of 25 kgs . ( laughter ) ''
`` the worth should be about $ 2.5 million . '' '' i said , `` '' solomon , if we 're going to do it , let 's go big . ''
`` there 's no point doing this at all unless you 're shipping at least a metric ton . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) he said , `` '' what do you do for a living ? '' '' ( laughter ) i said , `` '' i 'm a hedge fund executive bank manager . '' '' ( laughter ) this is n't the first time i 've shipped bullion , my friend , no no no . ''
then i started to panic .
`` i was like , `` '' where are you based ? '' '' i do n't know about you , but i think if we 're going via the postal service , it ought to be signed for . ''
`` that 's a lot of gold . '' '' he said , `` '' it will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment . '' '' i said , `` '' solomon , i 'm completely with you on this one . ''
i 'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting .
`` hold tight . '' '' ( laughter ) this is what i sent solomon . ( laughter ) ''
( applause ) i do n't know if we have any statisticians in the house , but there 's definitely something going on . ( laughter )
`` i said , `` '' solomon , attached to this email you 'll find a helpful chart . ''
i 've had one of my assistants run the numbers .
`` ( laughter ) we 're ready for shipping as much gold as possible . '' '' there 's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings , and this was it for solomon . ''
i was in sainsbury 's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties .
also you can cut up carrots , and you can dip them .
`` have you ever done that , solomon ? '' '' ( laughter ) he said , `` '' i have to go bed now . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) `` '' till morrow . ''
`` have sweet dream . '' '' i did n't know what to say ! ''
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' solomon , i spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence : lawyer : gummy bear . ''
bank : cream egg .
legal : fizzy cola bottle . claim : peanut m & ms .
documents : jelly beans .
i 've gone too far . so i had to backpedal a little .
`` i said , `` '' solomon , is the deal still on ? ''
`` kitkat . '' '' ( laughter ) because you have to be consistent . ''
then i did get an email back from him .
( laughter ) i 'm not joking , this is what turned up in my inbox .
this was a good day .
`` `` '' the business is on . ''
i am trying to raise the balance for the gummy bear — ( laughter ) so he can submit all the needed fizzy cola bottle jelly beans to the creme egg , for the peanut m & ms process to start . ( laughter )
`` send 1,500 pounds via a giant gummy lizard . '' '' ( applause ) and that was so much fun , right , that it got me thinking : like , what would happen if i just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as i could ? ''
and that 's what i 've been doing for three years on your behalf .
( laughter ) ( applause ) crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails .
it 's really difficult , and i highly recommend we do it .
i do n't think what i 'm doing is mean .
there are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers .
all i 'm doing is wasting their time .
and i think any time they 're spending with me is time they 're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings , right ?
and if you 're going to do this — and i highly recommend you do — get yourself a pseudonymous email address .
do n't use your own email address .
that 's what i was doing at the start and it was a nightmare .
`` but i 'll tell you what , though , guys , i 'll tell you what : any day is a good day , any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this : ( laughter ) `` '' i am winnie mandela , the second wife of nelson mandela the former south african president . '' '' i was like , oh ! — that winnie mandela . ( laughter ) ''
i know so many .
`` `` '' i need to transfer 45 million dollars out of the country because of my husband nelson mandela 's health condition . '' '' let that sink in . ''
she sent me this , which is hysterical .
( laughter ) and this .
and this looks fairly legitimate , this is a letter of authorization .
but to be honest , if there 's nothing written on it , it 's just a shape !
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' winnie , i 'm really sorry to hear of this . ''
`` she said , `` '' kindly comply with my bankers instructions . ''
`` i shot the sheriff . '' '' [ ( but i did not shoot the deputy ) ] ( laughter ) thank you . ''
( applause )
i remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen .
and your entire body , everything — your hair , skin , bone , nails — everything is made of collagen .
and it 's a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
within five weeks , you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles .
it 's a mystery , it 's magic , it 's divinity .
take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
i 'm mckenna pope . i 'm 14 years old , and when i was 13 , i convinced one of the largest toy companies , toymakers , in the world , hasbro , to change the way that they marketed one of their most best-selling products .
so allow me to tell you about it .
so i have a brother , gavin .
when this whole shebang happened , he was four .
he loved to cook .
he was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these , needless to say , uneatable concoctions , or making invisible macaroni and cheese .
he wanted to be a chef really badly .
and so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an easy-bake oven . right ?
i mean , we all had those when we were little .
and he wanted one so badly .
but then he started to realize something .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
and the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials , and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple , very gender-specific colors to females , right ?
so it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys are n't .
and this discouraged my brother a lot .
he thought that he was n't supposed to want to be a chef , because that was something that girls did .
girls cooked ; boys did n't , or so was the message that hasbro was sending .
and this got me thinking , god , i wish there was a way that i could change this , that could i have my voice heard by hasbro so i could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it .
and that got me thinking about a website that i had learned about a few months prior called change.org .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
and so i created a petition along with the youtube video that i added to the petition basically asking hasbro to change the way that they marketed it , in featuring boys in the commercials , on the boxes , and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors .
so this petition started to take off — humongously fast , you have no idea .
i was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets , and it was amazing .
in three weeks , maybe three and a half , i had 46,000 signatures on this petition .
( applause ) thank you .
so , needless to say , it was crazy .
eventually , hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new easy-bake oven product to me in black , silver and blue .
it was literally one of the best moments of my life .
`` it was like `` '' willy wonka and the chocolate factory . '' '' that thing was amazing . ''
what i did n't realize at the time , however , was that i had become an activist , i could change something , that even as a kid , or maybe even especially as a kid , my voice mattered , and your voice matters too .
i want to let you know it 's not going to be easy , and it was n't easy for me , because i faced a lot of obstacles .
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
and actually , i have some examples , because what 's better revenge than displaying their idiocy ?
so , let 's see .
`` from user name liquidsore29 — interesting user names we have here— `` disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay . '' ''
liquidsore29 , really ? really ? okay .
`` how about from whiteboy77ags : `` people always need something to ( female dog ) about . '' ''
`` from jeffrey gutierrez : `` omg , shut up . you just want money and attention . '' ''
so it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because i thought , people do n't care , people think it 's a waste of time , and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family .
it hurt me , and it made me think , what 's the point of making change in the future ?
but then i started to realize something .
haters gon na hate .
come on , say it with me . one , two , three : haters gon na hate .
so let your haters hate , you know what , and make your change , because i know you can .
i look out into this crowd , and i see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change , and i know that you can , and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in , and you can trade it across all these social media , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever else you can think of .
and you can make that change .
you can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it .
and that spark that you 've been hearing about all day today , you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire .
thank you .
( applause )
so yeah , i 'm a newspaper cartoonist — political cartoonist .
i do n't know if you 've heard about it — newspapers ?
it 's a sort of paper-based reader .
( laughter ) it 's lighter than an ipad , it 's a bit cheaper .
you know what they say ?
they say the print media is dying — who says that ? well , the media .
but this is no news , right ?
you 've read about it already .
( laughter ) ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller .
i know it 's a cliche , but look , look how small , how tiny it has gotten .
and you know the reason why , of course .
this is because of technology — yeah .
( laughter ) any computer designers in the room ?
yeah well , you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round , a nice round shape .
that makes a good cartoon .
but what are you going to do with a flat track pad , those square things ?
there 's nothing i can do as a cartoonist .
well , i know the world is flat now .
that 's true .
and the internet has reached every corner of the world , the poorest , the remotest places .
every village in africa now has a cyber cafe .
( laughter ) do n't go asking for a frappuccino there .
so we are bridging the digital divide .
the third world is connected , we are connected .
and what happens next ?
well , you 've got mail .
yeah .
well , the internet has empowered us .
it has empowered you , it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well .
( laughter ) you know , these last two cartoons — i did them live during a conference in hanoi .
and they were not used to that in communist 2.0 vietnam .
( laughter ) so i was cartooning live on a wide screen — it was quite a sensation — and then this guy came to me .
`` he was taking pictures of me and of my sketches , and i thought , `` '' this is great , a vietnamese fan . '' '' and as he came the second day , i thought , `` '' wow , that 's really a cartoon lover . '' '' and on the third day , i finally understood , the guy was actually on duty . ''
so by now , there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the vietnamese police .
( laughter ) no , but it 's true : the internet has changed the world .
it has rocked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music .
for those of you old enough to remember , we used to have to go to the store to steal it .
( laughter ) and it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application .
so be careful with that facebook account — your momma told you , be careful .
and technology has set us free — this is free wifi .
but yeah , it has liberated us from the office desk .
this is your life , enjoy it .
( laughter ) in short , technology , the internet , they have changed our lifestyle .
tech guru , like this man — that a german magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century — they are shaping the way we do things .
they are shaping the way we consume .
they are shaping our very desires .
( laughter ) ( applause ) you will not like it .
and technology has even changed our relationship to god .
( laughter ) now i should n't get into this .
religion and political cartoons , as you may have heard , make a difficult couple , ever since that day of 2005 , when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world — demonstrations , fatwa , they provoked violence . people died in the violence .
this was so sickening ; people died because of cartoons .
i mean — i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides , actually .
they were used first by a danish newspaper , which wanted to make a point on islam .
a danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24 who received the assignment to draw the prophet — 12 of them refused . did you know that ?
`` he told me , `` '' nobody has to tell me what i should draw . ''
`` this is not how it works . '' '' and then , of course , they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side . ''
they wanted to stir up controversy .
you know the story .
we know that cartoons can be used as weapons .
history tells us , they 've been used by the nazis to attack the jews .
and here we are now .
in the united nations , half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion — they call it the defamation of religion — while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech .
so the clash of civilizations is here , and cartoons are at the middle of it ?
this got me thinking .
now you see me thinking at my kitchen table , and since you 're in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
( laughter ) in 2006 , a few months after , i went ivory coast — western africa .
now , talk of a divided place — the country was cut in two .
you had a rebellion in the north , the government in the south — the capital , abidjan — and in the middle , the french army .
this looks like a giant hamburger .
you do n't want to be the ham in the middle .
i was there to report on that story in cartoons .
i 've been doing this for the last 15 years ; it 's my side job , if you want .
so you see the style is different .
this is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning .
i went to places like gaza during the war in 2009 .
so this is really journalism in cartoons .
you 'll hear more and more about it .
this is the future of journalism , i think .
and of course , i went to see the rebels in the north .
those were poor guys fighting for their rights .
there was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa .
and i went to see the dozo .
the dozo , they are the traditional hunters of west africa .
people fear them — they help the rebellion a lot .
they are believed to have magical powers .
they can disappear and escape bullets .
i went to see a dozo chief ; he told me about his magical powers .
`` he said , `` '' i can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life . '' '' i said , `` '' well , maybe we do n't have time for this right now . '' '' ( laughter ) `` another time . '' ''
so back in abidjan , i was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and i thought , yes , in a context like this , cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side .
i mean , the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided — it was compared to the media in rwanda before the genocide — so imagine .
and what can a cartoonist do ?
sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see , and the guy has to feed his family , right ?
so the idea was pretty simple .
we brought together cartoonists from all sides in ivory coast .
we took them away from their newspaper for three days .
and i asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
show the positive power of cartoons .
it 's a great tool of communication for bad or for good .
and cartoons can cross boundaries , as you have seen .
and humor is a good way , i think , to address serious issues .
and i 'm very proud of what they did .
i mean , they did n't agree with each other — that was not the point .
and i did n't ask them to do nice cartoons .
the first day , they were even shouting at each other .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in ivory coast .
so the idea was there .
and i 've been doing projects like this , in 2009 in lebanon , this year in kenya , back in january .
in lebanon , it was not a book .
the idea was to have — the same principal , a divided country — take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together .
so in lebanon , we enrolled the newspaper editors , and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page , addressing the issue affecting lebanon , like religion in politics and everyday life .
and it worked .
for three days , almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together — anti-government , pro-government , christian , muslim , of course , english-speaking , well , you name it .
so this was a great project .
and then in kenya , what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity , which is a poison in a lot of places in africa .
and we did video clips — you can see them if you go to youtube/kenyatoons .
so , preaching for freedom of speech is easy here , but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division , again , what can a cartoonist do ?
he has to keep his job .
well i believe that in any context anywhere , he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred .
and that 's the message i try to convey to them .
i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing .
but we need to support these [ unclear ] , critical and responsible voices in africa , in lebanon , in your local newspaper , in the apple store .
today , tech companies are the world 's largest editors .
they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see .
so really , it 's not about the freedom of cartoonists ; it 's about your freedoms .
and for dictators all over the world , the good news is when cartoonists , journalists and activists shut up .
thank you .
( applause )
they did .
in the same year , we were ready .
that would be a game-changing technology , right ?
but in fact , we already possess this device , and it 's called human communication system and effective storytelling .
to understand how this device works , we have to look into our brains .
and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner .
now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains .
and we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate .
first , your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave that i 'm transmitting to your brain .
and second , we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate .
so how do we know that ?
in my lab in princeton , we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories .
and to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using , let me play 20 seconds from a story that we used , told by a very talented storyteller , jim o'grady .
( audio ) jim o'grady : so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good , and then i start to make it better — ( laughter ) by adding an element of embellishment .
`` reporters call this `` '' making shit up . '' '' ( laughter ) and they recommend against crossing that line . ''
but i had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean and assault with a pastry .
`` and i kinda liked it . '' '' uri hasson : ok , so now let 's look into your brain and see what 's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories . ''
and let 's start simple — let 's start with one listener and one brain area : the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear .
and as you can see , in this particular brain area , the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding .
and we can ask : how similar are the responses across all listeners ?
so here you can see five listeners .
and we start to scan their brains before the story starts , when they 're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin .
as you can see , the brain area is going up and down in each one of them , but the responses are very different , and not in sync .
however , immediately as the story is starting , something amazing is happening .
( audio ) jo : so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good , and then i start to make it — uh : suddenly , you can see that the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story , and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners .
so , we 'll look and see five metronomes .
think of these five metronomes as five brains .
and similar to the listeners before the story starts , these metronomes are going to click , but they 're going to click out of phase .
( clicking ) now see what will happen when i connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders . ( clicking )
now these two cylinders start to rotate .
this rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together .
and now listen to the click .
( synchronized clicking ) this is what you call physical entrainment .
now let 's go back to the brain and ask : what 's driving this neural entrainment ?
is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing ?
or maybe it 's the words .
or maybe it 's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey .
so to test it , we did the following experiment .
first , we took the story and played it backwards .
and that preserved many of the original auditory features , but removed the meaning .
and it sounds something like that .
( audio ) jo : ( unintelligible ) and we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people .
and as you can see , this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds , but it did n't spread deeper into the brain .
now we can take these sounds and build words out of it .
now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
( audio ) jo : and they recommend against crossing that line .
`` he says : `` '' dear jim , good story . nice details . ''
and to test it , we did the following experiment in my lab .
we took the english story and translated it to russian .
now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning .
and you play the english story to the english listeners and the russian story to the russian listeners , and we can compare their responses across the groups .
and when we did that , we did n't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language , because the language and sound are very different .
we believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way , as we confirmed , using a test after the story ended .
and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication .
for example , as you can tell , i am not a native english speaker .
i grew up with another language , and the same might be for many of you in the audience .
and still , we can communicate .
how come ?
we think we can communicate because we have this common code that presents meaning .
so far , i 've only talked about what 's happening in the listener 's brain , in your brain , when you 're listening to talks .
to look in the speaker 's brain , we asked the speaker to go into the scanner , we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story .
you have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes .
here we 're asking : how similar are they ?
to our surprise , we saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain .
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
and we also found the stronger the similarity between the listener 's brain and the speaker 's brain , the better the communication .
now , let 's take all this information together and ask : how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my brain to your brains ?
so we did the following experiment .
`` we let people watch , for the first time in their life , a tv episode from the bbc series `` '' sherlock , '' '' while we scanned their brains . ''
and then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie .
so let 's be specific .
think about this exact scene , when sherlock is entering the cab in london driven by the murderer he is looking for .
with me , as a viewer , there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when i watch it .
now , the exact same pattern , i can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word : sherlock , london , murderer .
and when i 'm transmitting these words to your brains now , you have to reconstruct it in your mind .
in fact , we see that pattern emerging now in your brains .
and we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when i 'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern i had when i watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner .
this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information .
because , for example , now you 're listening really hard and trying to understand what i 'm saying .
and i know that it 's not easy .
but i hope that at one point in the talk we clicked , and you got me .
and i think that in a few hours , a few days , a few months , you 're going to meet someone at a party , and you 're going to tell him about this lecture , and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us .
now you can see how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people , which is wonderful , right ?
but our ability to communicate relies on our ability to have common ground .
`` because , for example , if i 'm going to use the british synonym `` hackney carriage '' instead of `` cab , '' i know that i 'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience . ''
because we know that in many cases , people understand the exact same story in very different ways .
so to test it in the lab , we did the following experiment .
`` we took a story by j.d . salinger , in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party , and he 's calling his best friend , asking , `` '' did you see my wife ? '' '' for half of the subjects , we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend . ''
for the other half , we said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous .
this one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group .
so let me summarize .
if everything worked as planned tonight , i used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains .
and i used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains .
in this , i start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate .
and we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication .
but these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground .
and we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic , and manipulate and control the way we all think .
because after all , the people we are coupled to define who we are .
and our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very early age .
so let me finish with an example from my own private life that i think is a good example of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are .
this my son jonathan at a very early age .
see how he developed a vocal game together with my wife , only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being .
and think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life .
so keep being coupled to other people .
15 years ago , i volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test .
when i arrived at the clinic to be tested , i was handed a questionnaire .
one of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race : white , black , asian , or native american .
i was n't quite sure how to answer the question .
was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants ' social backgrounds ?
`` in that case , i would answer with my social identity , and check the box for `` '' black . '' '' but what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits ? ''
in that case , would n't they want to know something about my ancestry , which is just as much european as african ?
and how could they make scientific findings about my genes if i put down my social identity as a black woman ?
after all , i consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons .
which racial identity i check has nothing to do with my genes .
`` well , despite the obvious importance of this question to the study 's scientific validity , i was told , `` '' do n't worry about it , just put down however you identify yourself . '' '' so i check `` '' black , '' '' but i had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically . ''
that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking : where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions ?
well , i found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice .
and the more i found out , the more disturbed i became .
sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction .
when we identify people as black , white , asian , native american , latina , we 're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world .
as a legal scholar , i 've also studied how lawmakers , not biologists , have invented the legal definitions of races .
and it 's not just the view of social scientists .
`` president bill clinton famously declared , `` '' i believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms , human beings , regardless of race , are more than 99.9 percent the same . '' '' and he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference does n't fall into racial boxes . ''
`` `` '' i am happy that today , the only race we 're talking about is the human race . '' '' doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine , and they 're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution . ''
but their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind .
take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate , or gfr .
doctors routinely interpret gfr , this important indicator of kidney function , by race .
as you can see in this lab test , the exact same creatinine level , the concentration in the blood of the patient , automatically produces a different gfr estimate depending on whether or not the patient is african-american .
why ?
i 've been told it 's based on an assumption that african-americans have more muscle mass than people of other races .
but what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume i have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder ?
would n't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them ?
well , doctors tell me they 're using race as a shortcut .
it 's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors , like muscle mass , enzyme level , genetic traits they just do n't have time to look for .
but race is a bad proxy .
in many cases , race adds no relevant information at all .
it 's just a distraction .
but race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures .
it blinds doctors to patients ' symptoms , family illnesses , their history , their own illnesses they might have — all more evidence-based than the patient 's race .
race ca n't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being .
doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account , but there are numerous medical tests , like the gfr , that use race categorically to treat black , white , asian patients differently just because of their race .
race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes .
black and latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain , exaggerate their pain , and are predisposed to drug addiction .
the food and drug administration has even approved a race-specific medicine .
it 's a pill called bidil to treat heart failure in self-identified african-american patients .
a cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics , but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients .
the fda then allowed the company , the drug company , to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included african-american subjects .
it speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs .
but think about the dangerous message it sent , that black people 's bodies are so substandard , a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients .
in the end , the drug company 's marketing scheme failed .
for one thing , black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people .
dr. samuel cartwright graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school .
`` he practiced in the deep south before the civil war , and he was a well-known expert on what was then called `` '' negro medicine . '' '' he promoted the racial concept of disease , that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently . ''
cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons .
he claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites , forced labor was good for them .
`` he wrote in a medical journal , `` '' it is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man 's control , and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom . '' '' to support this theory , cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people 's lungs . ''
today , doctors still uphold cartwright 's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people .
`` some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled `` '' race '' '' so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race . ''
`` it 's a well-known function called `` '' correcting for race . '' '' the problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients . ''
its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health : lack of access to high-quality medical care ; food deserts in poor neighborhoods ; exposure to environmental toxins ; high rates of incarceration ; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination .
you see , race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference .
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences , but because of the impact of social inequality on people 's health .
yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill .
it 's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them .
the reason i 'm so passionate about ending race medicine is n't just because it 's bad medicine .
i 'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity .
despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we 've been learning about , there 's a failure of imagination when it comes to race .
would you imagine with me , just a moment : what would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race ?
suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity , that human beings can not be categorized into biological races ?
what if , instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor , doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor ?
what if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism , not by genetic difference ?
race medicine is bad medicine , it 's poor science and it 's a false interpretation of humanity .
it is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . thanks . thank you .
now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
now open your eyes .
what about a life ?
what you see here is a premature baby .
this baby is so tiny he does n't have enough fat on his body to stay warm .
four million of these babies die annually .
but the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe , long-term health problems .
the reason is because in the first month of a baby 's life , its only job is to grow .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
that is the primary function of an incubator .
but traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars .
as a result , parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies ' bodies , or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here — methods that are both ineffective and unsafe .
but that hospital was over four hours away , and sevitha did n't have the means to get there , so her baby died .
you can open it up completely . it 's waterproof .
there 's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily .
but the magic is in this pouch of wax .
this is a phase-change material .
it 's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees celsius .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth .
in designing this we followed a few basic principles .
we really tried to understand the end user , in this case , people like sevitha .
we tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists .
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an embrace .
almost a year ago , my aunt started suffering back pains .
she went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost 30 years .
they recommended that she do some therapy , but after a while she was n't feeling better , so the doctors decided to do further tests .
so finally , they decided to do a biopsy , and two weeks later , the results of the biopsy came back .
it was stage 3 lung cancer .
her lifestyle was almost free of risk .
she never smoked a cigarette , she never drank alcohol , and she had been playing sports for almost half her life .
perhaps , that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed .
my story might be , unfortunately , familiar to most of you .
one out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer , and one out of four will die because of it .
not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family , but that process of going back and forth with new tests , different doctors describing symptoms , discarding diseases over and over , was stressful and frustrating , especially for my aunt .
and that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history .
we have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer , but we still have 20th-century procedures and processes for diagnosis , if any .
today , most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is wrong .
today , the majority of people still do n't have access to early cancer detection methods , even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it .
we know that we can change this in our lifetime , and that is why my team and i have decided to begin this journey , this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and monitoring the appropriate response at the molecular level easier , cheaper , smarter and more accessible than ever before .
but progress in biotech is not only being accelerated , it is also being democratized .
just as personal computers or the internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship , politics or education , recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well , and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches .
we are a team of scientists and technologists from chile , panama , mexico , israel and greece , and based on recent scientific discoveries , we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample .
we do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called micrornas .
as you might know , proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body , like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna , but before a protein is expressed or produced , relevant parts of its genetic code present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna , so this messenger rna has instructions on how to build a specific protein , and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins , but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are micrornas .
so micrornas are small molecules that regulate gene expression .
unlike dna , which is mainly fixed , micrornas can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time , telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment .
and that is what makes micrornas such a promising biomarker for cancer , because as you know , cancer is a disease of altered gene expression .
it is the uncontrolled regulation of genes .
another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same , but at the microrna level , there are patterns .
however , the problem with micrornas is that we can not use existing dna-based technology to detect them in a reliable way , because they are very short sequences of nucleotides , much smaller than dna .
and also , all micrornas are very similar to each other , with just tiny differences .
so imagine trying to differentiate two molecules , extremely similar , extremely small .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we 've shown it in public .
let me do a demonstration .
imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test , a lab technician extracts a total rna , which is quite simple today , and puts it in a standard 96-well plate like this one .
each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign , that is looking for a specific microrna , acting like a trap that closes only when the microrna is present in the sample , and when it does , it will shine with green color .
to run the reaction , you put the plate inside a device like this one , and then you can put your smartphone on top of it .
if we can have a camera here so you can see my screen .
a smartphone is a connected computer and it 's also a camera , good enough for our purpose .
this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time .
then , if we take this specific pattern of microrna of this person 's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microrna patterns with a specific presence of a disease , this is how pancreatic cancer looks like .
this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer .
if we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer , we need to stop treating them as acute , isolated episodes , and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis .
this entire platform is a working prototype .
since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized , this entire solution costs at least 50 times less than current available methods , and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more , so we 're making the design of the device open-source .
( applause ) let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages , but so far , we have been able to successfully identify the microrna pattern of pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer and hepatic cancer .
and currently , we 're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the german cancer research center with 200 women for breast cancer .
( applause ) this is the single non-invasive , accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done .
since we 're looking for the microrna patterns in your blood at any given time , you do n't need to know which cancer you 're looking for .
you do n't need to have any symptoms .
you only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools .
today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
that is , at stage 3 or 4 , and i believe that is too late .
it is too expensive for our families .
it is too expensive for humanity .
we can not lose the war against cancer .
it not only costs us billions of dollars , but it also costs us the people we love .
today , my aunt , she 's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude .
however , i want fights like this to become very rare .
i want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages , and i 'm certain that in the very near future , because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences , the way we see cancer will radically change .
it will give us the chance of detecting it early , understanding it better , and finding a cure .
thank you very much .
( applause )
i want to address the issue of compassion .
compassion has many faces .
some of them are fierce ; some of them are wrathful ; some of them are tender ; some of them are wise .
`` a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , `` '' love and compassion are necessities . ''
they are not luxuries .
`` without them , humanity can not survive . '' '' and i would suggest , it is not only humanity that wo n't survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we 've heard today . ''
it is the big cats , and it 's the plankton .
two weeks ago , i was in bangalore in india .
i was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of bangalore .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragile , obviously in the latter phase of active dying .
i looked into her face .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
`` and i remembered a line from the mahabharata , the great indian epic : `` what is the most wondrous thing in the world , yudhisthira ? '' ''
`` and yudhisthira replied , `` '' the most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we do n't realize it can happen to us . '' '' i looked up . ''
tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around bangalore .
i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
i watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
my gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person .
and it reminded me of something that i had just been present for .
every year or so , i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau .
and we run clinics in these very remote regions where there 's no medical care whatsoever .
and on the first day at simikot in humla , far west of nepal , the most impoverished region of nepal , an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags .
and he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes .
the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
again , the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara .
it was the young women , the health aids , who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .
i know those hands and eyes ; they touched me as well .
they touched me at that time .
they have touched me throughout my 68 years .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
she had phenomenal strength .
and it was really her strength , i believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
so we can ask : what is compassion comprised of ?
and there are various facets .
and there 's referential and non-referential compassion .
but first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
it is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that i 'm not separate from this suffering .
but that is not enough , because compassion , which activates the motor cortex , means that we aspire , we actually aspire to transform suffering .
and if we 're so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
but compassion has another component , and that component is really essential .
that component is that we can not be attached to outcome .
now i worked with dying people for over 40 years .
i had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security [ prison ] for six years .
and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
it is there within every human being .
but the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
i had that condition , to a certain extent , from my own childhood illness .
eve ensler , whom you 'll hear later , has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through .
and what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies , and those enemies are things like pity , moral outrage , fear .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
and in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
the very word terror is global .
the very feeling of terror is global .
so our work , in a certain way , is to address this imago , this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe .
now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities .
for example : a person who is cultivating compassion , when they are in the presence of suffering , they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do .
however , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
this is called resilience .
many of us think that compassion drains us , but i promise you it is something that truly enlivens us .
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration .
it hooks up all parts of the brain .
another , which has been discovered by various researchers at emory and at davis and so on , is that compassion enhances our immune system .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
( laughter ) most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons , of the toxins of our world .
but compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobilizes our immunity .
you know , if compassion is so good for us , i have a question .
why do n't we train our children in compassion ?
( applause ) if compassion is so good for us , why do n't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they 're supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
and if compassion is so good for us , why do n't we vote on compassion ?
why do n't we vote for people in our government based on compassion , so that we can have a more caring world ?
`` in buddhism , we say , `` '' it takes a strong back and a soft front . '' '' it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions . ''
and that is the mental quality of equanimity .
but it also takes a soft front — the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an undefended heart .
and the archetype of this in buddhism is avalokiteshvara , kuan-yin .
it 's a female archetype : she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
she stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liberation , and in the palm of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
i say that , for thousands of years , women have lived , exemplified , met in intimacy , the archetype of avalokitesvara , of kuan-yin , she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered , unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .
they have infused societies with kindness , and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half .
and they have actualized compassion through direct action .
jody williams called it : it 's good to meditate .
i 'm sorry , you 've got to do a little bit of that , jody .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
( laughter ) but the other side of the equation is you 've got to come out of your cave .
you have to come into the world like asanga did , who was looking to realize maitreya buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm out of here . '' '' he 's going down the path . ''
he sees something in the path .
he looks , it 's a dog , he drops to his knees .
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
the wound is just filled with maggots .
he puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots , so as not to harm them .
and at that moment , the dog transformed into the buddha of love and kindness .
i believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men — with their fathers , with their sons , with their brothers , with the plumbers , the road builders , the caregivers , the doctors , the lawyers , with our president , and with all beings .
the women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire .
may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
thank you .

the brain is an amazing and complex organ .
and so in order to be able to access the brain , you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools .
and there are zero cures for these diseases .
you guys want to see some ?
so i need a volunteer .
so right before — what is your name ? ( applause ) sam kelly : sam .
greg gage : all right , sam , i 'm going to record from your brain .
sk : no .
they 're sending electrical messages back and forth , and chemical messages .
so i 'm going to turn this on for a second .
let 's take a look at it as well .
so i 'm going to stand over here , and i 'm going to open up our app here .
so now i want you to squeeze .
what is your name , sir ?
you 're going to stand right here .
i want you to move your arm as well .
so your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles .
so in a sense , she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand .
you with me ?
so i just need to hook you up .
( laughter ) so i 'm going to find your ulnar nerve , which is probably right around here .
okay , so sam , i want you to squeeze your hand again .
do it again . perfect .
now i want you to relax your hand .
sam , you 're with me ?
so you 're going to squeeze .
i 'm not going to turn it on yet , so go ahead and give it a squeeze .
mg : ready as i 'll ever be .
gg : i 've turned it on , so go ahead and turn your hand .
do you feel that a little bit ? mg : nope .
gg : a little bit ? ( laughter ) so relax .
so hit it again .
( laughter ) oh , perfect , perfect .
so relax , do it again .
all right , so right now , your brain is controlling your arm and it 's also controlling his arm , so go ahead and just do it one more time .
all right , so it 's perfect . ( laughter ) so now , what would happen if i took over my control of your hand ?
and so , just relax your hand .
what happens ?
ah , nothing .
why not ?
because the brain has to do it .
so you do it again .
all right , that 's perfect .
thank you guys for being such a good sport .
this is what 's happening all across the world — electrophysiology !

meet tony . he 's my student .
he 's about my age , and he 's in san quentin state prison .
`` when tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , `` '' it was mom 's gun . ''
just flash it , scare the guy . he 's a punk .
he took some money ; we 'll take his money . that 'll teach him .
`` then last minute , i 'm thinking , 'ca n't do this . this is wrong . ' my buddy says , 'c'mon , let 's do this . ' i say , 'let 's do this . ' '' '' and those three words , tony 's going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop . ''
there 's the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
and that 's felony murder — 25 to life , parole at 50 if you 're lucky , and tony 's not feeling very lucky .
`` so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say , `` '' in this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , '' '' tony interrupts me . ''
`` `` '' what are you going to teach me about right and wrong ? ''
i know what is wrong . i have done wrong .
i am told every day , by every face i see , every wall i face , that i am wrong .
if i ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name .
`` i 'm a convict ; i am branded 'wrong . ' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? '' '' so i say to tony , `` '' sorry , but it 's worse than you think . ''
you think you know right and wrong ?
then can you tell me what wrong is ?
no , do n't just give me an example .
i want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
what is that idea ?
what makes something wrong ?
how do we know that it 's wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
maybe it 's you , maybe it 's me — but we 're not here to trade opinions ; everyone 's got an opinion .
we are here for knowledge .
`` our enemy is thoughtlessness . this is philosophy . '' '' and something changes for tony . ''
`` `` '' could be i 'm wrong . i 'm tired of being wrong . ''
i want to know what is wrong .
`` i want to know what i know . '' '' what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder — what kant called `` '' admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within . '' '' what can creatures like us know of such things ? ''
`` it is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence — what heidegger called `` '' the always already there . '' '' it is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it — what socrates called `` '' the examined life . '' '' socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing . ''
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
so tony starts doing his homework .
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
turns out , tony 's got the philosophy muscle .
his body is in prison , but his mind is free .
tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous .
that 's plato , descartes , nietzsche and bill clinton .
`` so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , `` '' i do n't know . ''
`` let us think about that . '' '' because in that moment , there 's no mark by tony 's name ; it 's just the two of us standing there . ''
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
`` and i say to tony , `` let 's do this . '' ''
thank you .

i was a surgical resident at the johns hopkins hospital , taking emergency call .
i can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back to see her .
and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
that was n't being asked .
the question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an amputation ?
now , looking back on that night , i 'd love so desperately to believe that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i 'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the e.r . three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer .
in her case , i knew there was nothing i could do that was actually going to save her life .
the cancer was too advanced .
i brought some for her parents .
but more importantly , see , i passed no judgment on her , because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself .
so why was it that , just a few nights later , as i stood in that same e.r . and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation , why did i hold her in such bitter contempt ?
she was fat .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
as i looked down at her in the bed , i thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you would n't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you 've never met about to amputate your foot .
but i actually do .
you see , in the hubris of my youth , i thought i had her all figured out .
she ate too much . she got unlucky .
she got diabetes . case closed .
yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills americans eight times more frequently than melanoma , i never once questioned the conventional wisdom .
i actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science .
three years later , i found out how wrong i was .
but this time , i was the patient .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , i 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
some of you may have heard of this .
i had become insulin-resistant .
you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
and insulin resistance , as its name suggests , is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job .
with that scare , i got busy changing my diet radically , adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking .
i did this and lost 40 pounds , weirdly while exercising less .
i , as you can see , i guess i 'm not overweight anymore .
if the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me , was it possible it was failing someone else ?
and underlying these questions , i became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
you treat the obesity .
but what if we have it backwards ?
what if obesity is n't the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
in fact , what if it 's a symptom of a much deeper problem , the tip of a proverbial iceberg ?
i 'm not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
`` so now , when insulin says to a cell , i want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe , the cell , in effect , says , `` no thanks , i 'd actually rather store this energy . '' ''
so for many of us , about 75 million americans , the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat , not the reverse , getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat .
this is a really subtle distinction , but the implication could be profound .
consider the following analogy : think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table .
sure , the bruise hurts like hell , and you almost certainly do n't like the discolored look , but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem .
in fact , it 's the opposite . it 's a healthy response to the trauma , all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body .
now , imagine we thought bruises were the problem , and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises : masking creams , painkillers , you name it , all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables .
getting it wrong , and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins .
cause and effect .
so what i 'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance .
maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
let 's look at some suggestive facts .
and by the way , they do n't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people .
now i do n't know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells have n't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy .
so if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance , and you can be lean and have it , this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what 's going on .
so what if we 're fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
even worse , what if blaming the obese means we 're blaming the victims ?
personally , i ca n't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore , let alone the luxury of certainty .
i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but i 'm wide open to others .
if you ask yourself , what 's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant , the answer probably is n't too much food .
it 's more likely too much glucose : blood sugar .
when i lost my 40 pounds a few years ago , i did it simply by restricting those things , which admittedly suggests i have a bias based on my personal experience .
but that does n't mean my bias is wrong , and most important , all of this can be tested scientifically .
but step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity , diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested .
i 'm betting my career on this .
today , i devote all of my time to working on this problem , and i 'll go wherever the science takes me .
i 've decided that what i ca n't and wo n't do anymore is pretend i have the answers when i do n't .
i 've been humbled enough by all i do n't know .
for the past year , i 've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country , and the best part is , just like abraham lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals , we 've done the same thing .
we 've recruited a team of scientific rivals , the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what 's at the heart of this epidemic .
some think it 's too many calories consumed .
others think it 's too much dietary fat .
others think it 's too many refined grains and starches .
but this team of multi-disciplinary , highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer .
and two , if we 're willing to be wrong , if we 're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer , we can solve this problem .
i know it 's tempting to want an answer right now , some form of action or policy , some dietary prescription — eat this , not that — but if we want to get it right , we 're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription .
first , how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism , hormones and enzymes , and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms ?
second , based on these insights , can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that 's safe and practical to implement ?
just because you know what to do does n't mean you 're always going to do it .
sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier , and believe it or not , that can be studied scientifically .
i do n't know how this journey is going to end , but this much seems clear to me , at least : we ca n't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like i did .
most of them actually want to do the right thing , but they have to know what that is , and it 's got to work .
staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science .
if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
sometimes i think back to that night in the e.r .
seven years ago .
i wish i could speak with that woman again .
i 'd like to tell her how sorry i am .
you did n't need my judgment and my contempt .
you needed my empathy and compassion , and above all else , you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you did n't let the system down .
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .
if you 're watching this now , i hope you can forgive me .

this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
he stayed late at night every day .
every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation .
and if they said yes , they built it .
we basically eliminated it .
so low numbers mean that people worked harder .
and this is basically the result we had before .
ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
`` it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , `` '' here is my cake . '' '' no , it was somebody else 's cake , as if you bought it in the store . ''
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money .
but imagine this was slightly different .
and if you do all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
but if you do one step every time , maybe you do n't care as much .

this is my great uncle , my father 's father 's younger brother .
his name was joe mckenna .
family history says he loved being a fireman , and so in 1938 , on one of his days off , he elected to hang out at the firehouse .
to make himself useful that day , he started polishing all the brass , the railings on the fire truck , the fittings on the walls , and one of the fire hose nozzles , a giant , heavy piece of metal , toppled off a shelf and hit him .
a few days later , his shoulder started to hurt .
two days after that , he spiked a fever .
the fever climbed and climbed .
his wife was taking care of him , but nothing she did made a difference , and when they got the local doctor in , nothing he did mattered either .
they flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital .
`` the nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection , what at the time they would have called `` '' blood poisoning , '' '' and though they probably did n't say it , they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do . ''
there was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections did n't exist yet .
the first test of penicillin , the first antibiotic , was three years in the future .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
my great uncle was not lucky .
he was in the hospital for a week , shaking with chills , dehydrated and delirious , sinking into a coma as his organs failed .
his condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood .
nothing worked . he died .
he was 30 years old .
if you look back through history , most people died the way my great uncle died .
most people did n't die of cancer or heart disease , the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the west today .
they did n't die of those diseases because they did n't live long enough to develop them .
all of that changed when antibiotics arrived .
suddenly , infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days .
it seemed like a miracle , and ever since , we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs .
and now , we are coming to an end of it .
my great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era .
we stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era , in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had will kill people once again .
in fact , they already are .
briefly , it works like this .
bacteria compete against each other for resources , for food , by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other .
other bacteria , to protect themselves , evolve defenses against that chemical attack .
when we first made antibiotics , we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them , and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had .
here is what happened next : penicillin was distributed in 1943 , and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945 .
imipenem in 1985 , and resistance to in 1998 .
daptomycin , one of the most recent drugs , in 2003 , and resistance to it just a year later in 2004 .
for 70 years , we played a game of leapfrog — our drug and their resistance , and then another drug , and then resistance again — and now the game is ending .
bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest , so there are infections moving across the world for which , out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market , two drugs might work with side effects , or one drug , or none .
this is what that looks like .
in 2000 , the centers for disease control and prevention , the cdc , identified a single case in a hospital in north carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs .
today , that infection , known as kpc , has spread to every state but three , and to south america , europe and the middle east .
in 2008 , doctors in sweden diagnosed a man from india with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time .
the gene that creates that resistance , known as ndm , has now spread from india into china , asia , africa , europe and canada , and the united states .
it would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases , but in fact , in the united states and europe , 50,000 people a year die of infections which no drugs can help .
a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year .
that is a lot of deaths , and yet , the chances are good that you do n't feel at risk , that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives , people whose infections are remote from us , in situations we ca n't identify with .
what you did n't think about , none of us do , is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life .
if we lost antibiotics , here 's what else we 'd lose : first , any protection for people with weakened immune systems — cancer patients , aids patients , transplant recipients , premature babies .
next , any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body : stents for stroke , pumps for diabetes , dialysis , joint replacements .
how many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees ?
a recent study estimates that without antibiotics , one out of ever six would die .
next , we 'd probably lose surgery .
many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics .
without that protection , we 'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body .
so no heart operations , no prostate biopsies , no cesarean sections .
we 'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor .
strep throat used to cause heart failure .
skin infections led to amputations .
giving birth killed , in the cleanest hospitals , almost one woman out of every 100 .
pneumonia took three children out of every 10 .
after all , the first person to receive penicillin , a british policeman named albert alexander , who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye , was infected by doing something very simple .
he walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn .
that british project i mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year also predicts that if we ca n't get this under control by 2050 , not long , the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year .
how did we get to this point where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers ?
the difficult answer is , we did it to ourselves .
resistance is an inevitable biological process , but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it .
we did this by squandering antibiotics with a heedlessness that now seems shocking .
penicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s .
in much of the developing world , most antibiotics still are .
in the united states , 50 percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary .
forty-five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor 's offices are for conditions that antibiotics can not help .
and that 's just in healthcare .
on much of the planet , most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives , not to cure illnesses , but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in .
in the united states , possibly 80 percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals , not to humans , creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water , in dust , in the meat the animals become .
aquaculture depends on antibiotics too , particularly in asia , and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples , pears , citrus , against disease .
and because bacteria can pass their dna to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport , once we have encouraged that resistance into existence , there is no knowing where it will spread .
this was predictable .
in fact , it was predicted by alexander fleming , the man who discovered penicillin .
`` he was given the nobel prize in 1945 in recognition , and in an interview shortly after , this is what he said : `` '' the thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a man who succumbs to infection with a pencillin-resistant organism . '' '' he added , `` '' i hope this evil can be averted . '' '' can we avert it ? ''
there are companies working on novel antibiotics , things the superbugs have never seen before .
we need those new drugs badly , and we need incentives : discovery grants , extended patents , prizes , to lure other companies into making antibiotics again .
but that probably wo n't be enough .
here 's why : evolution always wins .
bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes .
it takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug .
every time we use an antibiotic , we give the bacteria billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we 've constructed .
there has never yet been a drug they could not defeat .
this is asymmetric warfare , but we can change the outcome .
we could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically how antibiotics are being used .
we could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look .
we could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use .
we could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next .
those are the tech solutions .
they probably are n't enough either , unless we help .
antibiotic resistance is a habit .
we all know how hard it is to change a habit .
but as a society , we 've done that in the past .
people used to toss litter into the streets , used to not wear seatbelts , used to smoke inside public buildings .
we do n't do those things anymore .
we do n't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer , because we decided those things were expensive , destructive , not in our best interest .
we changed social norms .
we could change social norms around antibiotic use too .
i know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming , but if you 've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change , or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil , you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem .
we could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too .
we could forgo giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one .
we could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid 's ear infection before we 're sure what caused it .
we could ask every restaurant , every supermarket , where their meat comes from .
we could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use , and if we did those things , we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world .
but we have to do it soon .
penicillin began the antibiotic era in 1943 .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
we wo n't get 70 years to find our way back out again .
thank you very much .
( applause )
thank you very much .
i moved to america 12 years ago with my wife terry and our two kids .
actually , truthfully , we moved to los angeles — ( laughter ) thinking we were moving to america , but anyway — ( laughter ) it 's a short plane ride from los angeles to america . ( laughter )
`` i got here 12 years ago , and when i got here , i was told various things , like , `` '' americans do n't get irony . '' '' ( laughter ) have you come across this idea ? ''
it 's not true .
i 've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country .
i have found no evidence that americans do n't get irony .
we 've invaded every country we 've encountered .
you know , so when you leave living rooms in europe , people say , thankfully , nobody was ironic in your presence .
`` ( laughter ) but i knew that americans get irony when i came across that legislation , `` '' no child left behind . '' '' ( laughter ) because whoever thought of that title gets irony . ( laughter ) ''
do n't they ?
( applause ) because it 's leaving millions of children behind .
`` now i can see that 's not a very attractive name for legislation : `` millions of children left behind . '' ''
i can see that .
what 's the plan ?
we propose to leave millions of children behind , and here 's how it 's going to work .
and it 's working beautifully .
if we halved that number , one estimate is it would create a net gain to the u.s. economy over 10 years , of nearly a trillion dollars .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg .
what it does n't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it , who do n't enjoy it , who do n't get any real benefit from it .
and the reason is not that we 're not spending enough money .
america spends more money on education than most other countries .
class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
and there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education .
the trouble is , it 's all going in the wrong direction .
the first is this , that human beings are naturally different and diverse .
can i ask you , how many of you have got children of your own ?
okay . or grandchildren .
how about two children or more ? right .
and the rest of you have seen such children .
( laughter ) small people wandering about . ( laughter )
i will make you a bet , and i am confident that i will win the bet .
if you 've got two children or more , i bet you they are completely different from each other .
are n't they ?
( applause ) you would never confuse them , would you ?
`` like , `` '' which one are you ? remind me . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' your mother and i need some color-coding system so we do n't get confused . '' '' education under `` '' no child left behind '' '' is based on not diversity but conformity . ''
what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
`` one of the effects of `` '' no child left behind '' '' has been to narrow the focus onto the so-called stem disciplines . ''
they 're very important .
a real education has to give equal weight to the arts , the humanities , to physical education .
an awful lot of kids , sorry , thank you — ( applause ) one estimate in america currently is that something like 10 percent of kids , getting on that way , are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder .
adhd .
i 'm not saying there 's no such thing .
i just do n't believe it 's an epidemic like this .
if you sit kids down , hour after hour , doing low-grade clerical work , do n't be surprised if they start to fidget , you know ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
they 're suffering from childhood .
( laughter ) and i know this because i spent my early life as a child .
kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents , not just a small range of them .
and by the way , the arts are n't just important because they improve math scores .
the second , thank you — ( applause ) the second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity .
if you can light the spark of curiosity in a child , they will learn without any further assistance , very often .
children are natural learners .
it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it .
curiosity is the engine of achievement .
now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here , if i can say so , has been to de-professionalize teachers .
there is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers .
teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools .
but teaching is a creative profession .
teaching , properly conceived , is not a delivery system .
you know , you 're not there just to pass on received information .
great teachers do that , but what great teachers also do is mentor , stimulate , provoke , engage .
you see , in the end , education is about learning .
if there 's no learning going on , there 's no education going on .
an old friend of mine — actually very old , he 's dead .
( laughter ) that 's as old as it gets , i 'm afraid . ( laughter )
but a wonderful guy he was , wonderful philosopher .
he used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs .
you can be engaged in the activity of something , but not really be achieving it , like dieting .
( laughter ) it 's a very good example .
is he losing any weight ? not really .
`` you can say , `` '' there 's deborah , she 's in room 34 , she 's teaching . '' '' but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it . ''
the role of a teacher is to facilitate learning .
that 's it .
and part of the problem is , i think , that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning , but testing .
but they should not be the dominant culture of education .
they should be diagnostic . they should help .
( applause ) if i go for a medical examination , i want some standardized tests .
i do .
i want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else 's on a standard scale .
but all that should support learning .
it should n't obstruct it , which of course it often does .
so in place of curiosity , what we have is a culture of compliance .
our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity .
and the third principle is this : that human life is inherently creative .
it 's why we all have different résumés .
we create our lives , and we can recreate them as we go through them .
it 's the common currency of being a human being .
it 's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic .
i mean , other animals may well have imaginations and creativity , but it 's not so much in evidence , is it , as ours ?
i mean , you may have a dog .
and your dog may get depressed .
you know , but it does n't listen to radiohead , does it ?
( laughter ) and sit staring out the window with a bottle of jack daniels . ( laughter )
`` `` would you like to come for a walk ? '' ''
`` `` no , i 'm fine . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` you go . i 'll wait . but take pictures . '' ( laughter ) ''
instead , what we have is a culture of standardization .
now , it does n't have to be that way .
it really does n't .
finland regularly comes out on top in math , science and reading .
that 's one of the problems of the test .
they do n't look for other things that matter just as much .
the thing about work in finland is this : they do n't obsess about those disciplines .
they have a very broad approach to education , which includes humanities , physical education , the arts .
second , there is no standardized testing in finland .
`` and they all looked a bit bemused , and said , `` '' well , we do n't have one . ''
`` if people are in trouble , we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them . '' '' now people always say , `` well , you know , you ca n't compare finland to america . '' ''
no . i think there 's a population of around five million in finland .
but you can compare it to a state in america .
many states in america have fewer people in them than that .
i mean , i 've been to some states in america and i was the only person there .
( laughter ) really . really .
i was asked to lock up when i left .
( laughter ) but what all the high-performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident , sadly , across the systems in america — i mean , as a whole .
one is this : they individualize teaching and learning .
they recognize that it 's students who are learning and the system has to engage them , their curiosity , their individuality , and their creativity .
that 's how you get them to learn .
the second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession .
they recognize that you ca n't improve education if you do n't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development .
investing in professional development is not a cost .
it 's an investment , and every other country that 's succeeding well knows that , whether it 's australia , canada , south korea , singapore , hong kong or shanghai .
they know that to be the case .
you see , there 's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education — that 's what happens in some systems .
central or state governments decide , they know best and they 're going to tell you what to do .
the trouble is that education does n't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings .
it happens in classrooms and schools , and the people who do it are the teachers and the students , and if you remove their discretion , it stops working .
you have to put it back to the people .
it 's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time .
and the reason i think is this : that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education .
it 's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data , and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough , if we just get it right , it will all hum along perfectly into the future .
it wo n't , and it never did .
the point is that education is not a mechanical system .
it 's a human system .
it 's about people , people who either do want to learn or do n't want to learn .
every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography .
they may find it boring .
they may find it irrelevant .
they may find that it 's at odds with the life they 're living outside of school .
there are trends , but the stories are always unique .
i was at a meeting recently in los angeles of — they 're called alternative education programs .
these are programs designed to get kids back into education .
they have certain common features .
they 're very personalized .
they have strong support for the teachers , close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum , and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school .
and they work .
`` what 's interesting to me is , these are called `` '' alternative education . '' '' ( laughter ) you know ? ''
and all the evidence from around the world is , if we all did that , there 'd be no need for the alternative .
( applause ) ( applause ends ) so i think we have to embrace a different metaphor .
we have to recognize that it 's a human system , and there are conditions under which people thrive , and conditions under which they do n't .
we are after all organic creatures , and the culture of the school is absolutely essential .
culture is an organic term , is n't it ?
not far from where i live is a place called death valley .
death valley is the hottest , driest place in america , and nothing grows there .
nothing grows there because it does n't rain .
hence , death valley .
in the winter of 2004 , it rained in death valley .
seven inches of rain fell over a very short period .
and in the spring of 2005 , there was a phenomenon .
the whole floor of death valley was carpeted in flowers for a while .
what it proved is this : that death valley is n't dead .
it 's dormant .
right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about , and with organic systems , if the conditions are right , life is inevitable .
it happens all the time .
great leaders know that .
the real role of leadership in education — and i think it 's true at the national level , the state level , at the school level — is not and should not be command and control .
the real role of leadership is climate control , creating a climate of possibility .
and if you do that , people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and could n't have expected .
there 's a wonderful quote from benjamin franklin .
and if the movement is strong enough , that 's , in the best sense of the word , a revolution .
and that 's what we need .
thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
i know what you 're thinking .
you think i 've lost my way , and somebody 's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .
( applause ) i get that all the time in dubai .
`` `` here on holiday are you , dear ? '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' come to visit the children ? ''
`` how long are you staying ? '' '' well actually , i hope for a while longer yet . ''
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
( applause ) and in that time , i have seen a lot of changes .
now that statistic is quite shocking .
and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of english .
i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi .
and one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
but it was she who ended up learning all the arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses — medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
it 's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
but sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
a language dies every 14 days .
now , at the same time , english is the undisputed global language .
could there be a connection ?
well i do n't know .
but i do know that i 've seen a lot of changes .
when i first came out to the gulf , i came to kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post .
actually , not that long ago .
that is a little bit too early .
but nevertheless , i was recruited by the british council , along with about 25 other teachers .
and we were the first non-muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait .
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
and of course , the u.k. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .
okay .
now this is the major change that i 've seen — how teaching english has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today .
no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum , and no longer the sole domain of mother england , it has become a bandwagon for every english-speaking nation on earth .
and why not ?
after all , the best education — according to the latest world university rankings — is to be found in the universities of the u.k. and the u.s .
so everybody wants to have an english education , naturally .
but if you 're not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
perhaps you have a computer scientist who 's a genius .
would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
well , i do n't think so .
we english teachers reject them all the time .
we put a stop sign , and we stop them in their tracks .
they ca n't pursue their dream any longer , 'til they get english .
now let me put it this way : if i met a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would i stop him from entering my british university ?
i do n't think so .
but indeed , that is exactly what we do .
we english teachers are the gatekeepers .
and you have to satisfy us first that your english is good enough .
now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society .
maybe the barrier would be too universal .
okay .
`` `` '' but , '' '' i hear you say , `` '' what about the research ? ''
`` it 's all in english . '' '' so the books are in english , the journals are done in english , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy . ''
it feeds the english requirement .
and so it goes on .
i ask you , what happened to translation ?
if you think about the islamic golden age , there was lots of translation then .
they translated from latin and greek into arabic , into persian , and then it was translated on into the germanic languages of europe and the romance languages .
and so light shone upon the dark ages of europe .
now do n't get me wrong ; i am not against teaching english , all you english teachers out there .
i love it that we have a global language .
we need one today more than ever .
but i am against using it as a barrier .
do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being english , or chinese ?
we need more than that . where do we draw the line ?
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite arbitrary .
( applause ) and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today 's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english , they did n't have to pass an english test .
case in point , einstein .
he , by the way , was considered remedial at school because he was , in fact , dyslexic .
but fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an english test .
because they did n't start until 1964 with toefl , the american test of english .
now it 's exploded .
there are lots and lots of tests of english .
and millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
`` now you might think , you and me , `` those fees are n't bad , they 're okay , '' but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people . ''
so immediately , we 're rejecting them .
`` ( applause ) it brings to mind a headline i saw recently : `` education : the great divide . '' ''
now i get it , i understand why people would want to focus on english .
they want to give their children the best chance in life .
and to do that , they need a western education .
because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the western universities , that i put on earlier .
it 's a circular thing .
okay .
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
they were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals .
but they could n't get the results they wanted .
they really did n't know what to do , until along came a german scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb , whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does german .
so bingo , problem solved .
if you ca n't think a thought , you are stuck .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
my daughter came to england from kuwait .
she had studied science and mathematics in arabic .
it 's an arabic-medium school .
she had to translate it into english at her grammar school .
and she was the best in the class at those subjects .
which tells us that when students come to us from abroad , we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know , and they know it in their own language .
when a language dies , we do n't know what we lose with that language .
this is — i do n't know if you saw it on cnn recently — they gave the heroes award to a young kenyan shepherd boy who could n't study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the kerosene lamp , it had smoke and it damaged his eyes .
and anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
so he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
and now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home .
`` ( applause ) when he received his award , he said these lovely words : `` '' the children can lead africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . '' '' a simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences . ''
people who have no light , whether it 's physical or metaphorical , can not pass our exams , and we can never know what they know .
let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
let us celebrate diversity .
mind your language .
use it to spread great ideas .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
i 'm speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view , and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion .
the truth of the matter is otherwise .
`` our holy book , the koran , consists of 114 chapters , and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala , the saying of `` '' in the name of god , the all compassionate , the all merciful , '' '' or , as sir richard burton — not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor , but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature — translates it . `` `` in the name of god , the compassionating , the compassionate . '' '' and in a saying of the koran , which to muslims is god speaking to humanity , god says to his prophet muhammad — ''
`` whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets , beginning with adam , including noah , including moses , including abraham , including jesus christ , and ending with muhammad — that , `` '' we have not sent you , o muhammad , except as a 'rahmah , ' except as a source of compassion to humanity . '' '' for us human beings , and certainly for us as muslims , whose mission , and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet . ''
`` and the prophet , in one of his sayings , said , `` adorn yourselves with the attributes of god . '' ''
`` and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion — in fact , the koran says that `` '' god decreed upon himself compassion , '' '' or , `` '' reigned himself in by compassion '' '' — therefore , our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion , activators of compassion , actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion . ''
that is all well and good , but where do we go wrong , and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world ?
for the answer to this , we turn to our spiritual path .
in every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path .
`` the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism , or `` '' tasawwuf '' '' in arabic . ''
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition , refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
`` in one of the battles that the prophet waged , he told his followers , `` '' we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war , to the greater battle . '' '' and they said , `` '' messenger of god , we are battle-weary . ''
`` how can we go to a greater battle ? '' '' he said , `` '' that is the battle of the self , the battle of the ego . '' '' the sources of human problems have to do with egotism , `` '' i . '' '' the famous sufi master rumi , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he knocks on the door , and a voice answers , `` '' who 's there ? '' '' `` it 's me , '' or , more grammatically correctly , `` it is i , '' as we might say in english . ''
`` the voice says , `` '' go away . '' '' after many years of training , of disciplining , of search and struggle , he comes back . ''
with much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
`` the voice asks , `` '' who is there ? '' '' he said , `` '' it is you , o heartbreaker . '' '' the door swings open , and the voice says , `` come in , for there is no room in this house for two i 's , '' — two capital i 's , not these eyes — `` '' for two egos . '' '' and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path . ''
`` in the presence of god , there is no room for more than one `` '' i , '' '' and that is the `` '' i '' '' of divinity . ''
`` in a teaching — called a `` '' hadith qudsi '' '' in our tradition — god says that , `` '' my servant , '' '' or `` '' my creature , my human creature , does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do . '' '' and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean . ''
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they 've done that , then they can do extra .
but do n't ignore what you 've asked them to do .
`` `` '' and , '' '' god says , `` '' my servant continues to get nearer to me , by doing more of what i 've asked them to do '' '' — extra credit , we might call it — `` '' until i love him or love her . ''
`` and when i love my servant , '' '' god says , `` '' i become the eyes by which he or she sees , the ears by which he or she listens , the hand by which he or she grasps , and the foot by which he or she walks , and the heart by which he or she understands . '' '' it is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions . ''
muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism , the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path .
`` when he says , `` '' i am the spirit , and i am the way , '' '' and when the prophet muhammad said , `` '' whoever has seen me has seen god , '' '' it is because they became so much an instrument of god , they became part of god 's team — so that god 's will was manifest through them , and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos . ''
compassion on earth is given , it is in us .
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way .
i 'm sure , probably all of you here , or certainly the very vast majority of you , have had what you might call a spiritual experience , a moment in your lives when , for a few seconds , a minute perhaps , the boundaries of your ego dissolved .
and at that minute , you felt at one with the universe — one with that jug of water , one with every human being , one with the creator — and you felt you were in the presence of power , of awe , of the deepest love , the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives .
`` that is a moment which is a gift of god to us — a gift when , for a moment , he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on `` '' i , i , i , me , me , me , '' '' and instead , like the person in rumi 's story , we say , `` '' oh , this is all you . ''
this is all you . and this is all us .
and us , and i , and us are all part of you .
o , creator ! o , the objective ! the source of our being and the end of our journey , you are also the breaker of our hearts .
`` you are the one whom we should all be towards , for whose purpose we live , and for whose purpose we shall die , and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been compassionate beings . '' '' our message today , and our purpose today , and those of you who are here today , and the purpose of this charter of compassion , is to remind . ''
for the koran always urges us to remember , to remind each other , because the knowledge of truth is within every human being .
we know it all .
we have access to it all .
`` jung may have called it `` '' the subconscious . '' '' through our subconscious , in your dreams — the koran calls our state of sleep `` '' the lesser death , '' '' `` '' the temporary death '' '' — in our state of sleep we have dreams , we have visions , we travel even outside of our bodies , for many of us , and we see wonderful things . ''
we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it , and beyond the limitations of time as we know it .
but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating , the compassionate .
`` god , bokh , whatever name you want to call him with , allah , ram , om , whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity , it is the locus of absolute being , absolute love and mercy and compassion , and absolute knowledge and wisdom , what hindus call `` '' satchidananda . '' '' the language differs , but the objective is the same . ''
rumi has another story about three men , a turk , an arab and — and i forget the third person , but for my sake , it could be a malay .
one is asking for angur — one is , say , an englishman — one is asking for eneb , and one is asking for grapes .
`` and they have a fight and an argument because — `` '' i want grapes . '' '' `` `` i want eneb . `` `` i want angur . '' '' — not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages . ''
there 's only one absolute reality by definition , one absolute being by definition , because absolute is , by definition , single , and absolute and singular .
there 's this absolute concentration of being , the absolute concentration of consciousness , awareness , an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity .
and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human .
for what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but god defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
`` and the koran says , he speaks to the angels and says , `` '' when i have finished the formation of adam from clay , and breathed into him of my spirit , then , fall in prostration to him . '' '' the angels prostrate , not before the human body , but before the human soul . ''
why ? because the soul , the human soul , embodies a piece of the divine breath , a piece of the divine soul .
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image .
what is the imagery of god ?
the imagery of god is absolute being , absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love .
and therefore , for us to be human — in the greatest sense of what it means to be human , in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human — means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us , and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being , of being alive , of beingness ; the attribute of wisdom , of consciousness , of awareness ; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .
this is what i understand from my faith tradition , and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
and i believe , personally , that we 're on the verge and that , with the presence and help of people like you here , we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah .
for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore .
we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option : we must , we must lower our egos , control our egos — whether it is individual ego , personal ego , family ego , national ego — and let all be for the glorification of the one .
thank you , and god bless you .
( applause )
there 's still some confusion about that question , as this is a fairly new field of research .
`` for example , i was talking to one of my colleagues , robert , who is an oncologist , and he was telling me , `` '' sandrine , this is puzzling . ''
`` some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression . '' '' and i responded to him , `` '' well , from my point of view that makes sense . ''
`` the drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain . '' '' and then robert looked at me like i was crazy and said , `` '' but sandrine , these are adult patients — adults do not grow new nerve cells . '' '' and much to his surprise , i said , `` '' well actually , we do . '' '' and this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis . ''
[ neurogenesis ] now robert is not a neuroscientist , and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now — that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells .
so robert , you know , being the good doctor that he is , wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better .
and i took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis — and this is the hippocampus .
so this is this gray structure in the center of the brain .
and what we 've known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memory , mood and emotion .
however , what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated .
and if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in , what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain .
so when it comes to the human brain — my colleague jonas frisén from the karolinska institutet , has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus .
you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of neurons we have .
but by the time we turn 50 , we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons .
so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
first , we know that they 're important for learning and memory .
and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus , then we block certain memory abilities .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition — so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
and they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories , like : how do you find your bike that you park at the station every day in the same area , but in a slightly different position ?
and more interesting to my colleague robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression .
so in an animal model of depression , we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis .
and if we give antidepressants , then we increase the production of these newborn neurons , and we decrease the symptoms of depression , establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression .
but moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant .
so by then , robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer , because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated .
and it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions .
so , collectively , now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood , or even prevent the decline associated with aging , or associated with stress .
so the next question is : can we control neurogenesis ?
the answer is yes .
and we are now going to do a little quiz .
i 'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities , and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis .
are we ready ?
ok , let 's go .
so what about learning ?
increasing ?
yes .
learning will increase the production of these new neurons .
how about stress ?
yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
how about sleep deprivation ?
indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis .
how about sex ?
oh , wow !
( laughter ) yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new neurons .
we do n't want to fall in a situation — ( laughter ) about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation . ( laughter )
how about getting older ?
so the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older , but it is still occurring .
and then finally , how about running ?
i will let you judge that one by yourself .
so this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors , rusty gage from the salk institute , showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons .
and here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage .
and the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be .
and now , you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage .
so you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be .
so activity impacts neurogenesis , but that 's not all .
what you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
so here we have a sample of diet — of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy .
and i 'm just going to point a few out to you : calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis .
intermittent fasting — spacing the time between your meals — will increase neurogenesis .
intake of flavonoids , which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries , will increase neurogenesis .
omega-3 fatty acids , present in fatty fish , like salmon , will increase the production of these new neurons .
conversely , a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis .
ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis .
however , not everything is lost ; resveratrol , which is contained in red wine , has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons .
`` so next time you are at a dinner party , you might want to reach for this possibly `` '' neurogenesis-neutral '' '' drink . ''
so japanese groups are fascinated with food textures , and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis , as opposed to food that requires mastication — chewing — or crunchy food .
so all of this data , where we need to look at the cellular level , has been generated using animal models .
but this diet has also been given to human participants , and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis , such as : calorie restriction will improve memory capacity , whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression — as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids , which increase neurogenesis , and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression .
so we think that the effect of diet on mental health , on memory and mood , is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus .
and it 's not only what you eat , but it 's also the texture of the food , when you eat it and how much of it you eat .
on our side — neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis — we need to understand better the function of these new neurons , and how we can control their survival and their production .
we also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of robert 's patients .
and on your side — i leave you in charge of your neurogenesis .
thank you .
now , i told you you changed my life — i now eat a lot of blueberries .
sandrine thuret : very good .
mh : i 'm really interested in the running thing .
do i have to run ?
or is it really just about aerobic exercise , getting oxygen to the brain ?
could it be any kind of vigorous exercise ?
st : so for the moment , we ca n't really say if it 's just the running itself , but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production — or moving the blood flow to the brain , should be beneficial .
st : no , you do n't !
mh : oh , what a relief ! that 's wonderful .
sandrine thuret , thank you so much .
st : thank you , margaret .
i 've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named jack harlan .
and he described the diversity within crops — all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such — as a genetic resource .
`` and he said , `` '' this genetic resource , '' '' — and i 'll never forget the words — `` '' stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we can not imagine . '' '' i figured he was either really on to something , or he was one of these academic nutcases . ''
so , i looked a little further , and what i figured out was that he was n't a nutcase .
he was the most respected scientist in the field .
what he understood was that biological diversity — crop diversity — is the biological foundation of agriculture .
it 's the raw material , the stuff , of evolution in our agricultural crops .
not a trivial matter .
and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling , literally crumbling .
that indeed , a mass extinction was underway in our fields , in our agricultural system .
and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring .
now , i know that many of you do n't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and , let 's face it , that 's logical .
you do n't see it in the newspaper every day .
and when you go into the supermarket , you certainly do n't see a lot of choices there .
you see apples that are red , yellow , and green and that 's about it .
so , let me show you a picture of one form of diversity .
here 's some beans , and there are about 35 or 40 different varieties of beans on this picture .
now , imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane .
if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world , and i put 30 or 40 of them on a slide , it would take about 10 slides because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world .
but there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world , and i had a slide like this , and i switched it every second , it would take up my entire ted talk , and i would n't have to say anything .
but the interesting thing is that this diversity — and the tragic thing is — that this diversity is being lost .
we have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat , and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice , but it 's being lost .
and i want to give you an example of that .
it 's a bit of a personal example , in fact .
in the united states , in the 1800s — that 's where we have the best data — farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples .
imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
today , 6,800 of those are extinct , no longer to be seen again .
i used to have a list of these extinct apples , and when i would go out and give a presentation , i would pass the list out in the audience .
i would n't tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother 's maiden name .
`` and at the end of the speech , i would ask , `` '' how many people have found a name ? '' '' and i never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand . ''
`` and i said , `` '' you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them . ''
they gave them their name .
the bad news is they 're extinct .
the good news is a third of you did n't hold up your hand . your apple 's still out there .
`` find it . make sure it does n't join the list . '' '' so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there . ''
and there 's an old book back here , and i want to read a piece from it .
this book was published in 1904 .
`` it 's called `` '' the apples of new york '' '' and this is the second volume . ''
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
`` and the fowler apple is described in here — i hope this does n't surprise you — as , `` '' a beautiful fruit . '' '' ( laughter ) i do n't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ... ''
`` but , to be honest , the description goes on and it says that it `` '' does n't rank high in quality , however . '' '' and then he has to go even further . ''
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
`` `` '' as grown in new york , the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is , on the whole , unsatisfactory . '' '' ( laughter ) and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here , and the lesson is : so why save it ? ''
i get this question all the time . why do n't we just save the best one ?
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one .
today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change that the others do n't .
so it 's not necessary , thank god , that the fowler apple is the best apple in the world .
it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good , unique trait .
and for that reason , we ought to be saving it .
why ? as a raw material , as a trait we can use in the future .
think of diversity as giving us options .
and options , of course , are exactly what we need in an era of climate change .
i want to show you two slides , but first , i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists — particularly at stanford and university of washington — to ask the question : what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this ?
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past .
the coldest growing seasons of the future , hotter than the hottest of the past .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
i do n't know . can fish play the piano ?
if agriculture has n't experienced that , how could it be adapted ?
now , the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world , and the place where climate change , ironically , is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub-saharan africa .
so i 've picked two examples here , and i want to show you .
in the histogram before you now , the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures , going back about far as we have temperature data .
and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another .
some are colder , some are hotter and it 's a bell shaped curve .
the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons .
in the future , later this century , it 's going to look like the red , totally out of bounds .
the agricultural system and , more importantly , the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before .
here 's south africa . the same story .
but the most interesting thing about south africa is we do n't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble .
by 2030 , if the maize , or corn , varieties , which is the dominant crop — 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field — in 2030 , we 'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population , that 's a food crisis . it 's global in nature .
we will watch children starve to death on tv .
now , you may say that 20 years is a long way off .
it 's two breeding cycles for maize .
we have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
we have to get climate-ready crops in the field , and we have to do that rather quickly .
now , the good news is that we have conserved .
we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity , agricultural diversity , mostly in the form of seed , and we put it in seed banks , which is a fancy way of saying a freezer .
if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers , you dry it and then you freeze it .
unfortunately , these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable .
disasters have happened . in recent years we lost the gene bank , the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan . you can guess why .
in rwanda , in the solomon islands .
and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings , financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures , and all kinds of things , and every time something like this happens , it means extinction . we lose diversity .
and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys .
i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
so , a number of us got together and decided that , you know , enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of — maybe not the most charismatic diversity .
you do n't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear , but it 's very important diversity .
so we needed a really safe place , and we went quite far north to find it .
to svalbard , in fact .
this is above mainland norway . you can see greenland there .
that 's at 78 degrees north .
it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape . i ca n't even begin to describe it to you .
it 's otherworldly , beautiful .
we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen , the norwegian genetic resources program , to design this facility .
what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility , which is built in a mountain in svalbard .
the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold , so we get natural freezing temperatures .
but it 's remote . it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we do n't depend on mechanical refrigeration .
this is more than just an artist 's dream , it 's now a reality .
and this next picture shows it in context , in svalbard .
and here 's the front door of this facility .
when you open up the front door , this is what you 're looking at . it 's pretty simple . it 's a hole in the ground .
it 's a tunnel , and you go into the tunnel , chiseled in solid rock , about 130 meters .
there are now a couple of security doors , so you wo n't see it quite like this .
again , when you get to the back , you get into an area that 's really my favorite place .
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd , but ...
( laughter ) some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... ( laughter )
in this place there .
( applause ) if you were to walk into one of these rooms , you would see this .
it 's not very exciting , but if you know what 's there , it 's pretty emotional .
we have now about 425,000 samples of unique crop varieties .
there 's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now .
about a year from now , we 'll have over half a million samples .
we 're going up to over a million , and someday we 'll basically have samples — about 500 seeds — of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility .
this is a backup system for world agriculture .
it 's a backup system for all the seed banks . storage is free .
it operates like a safety deposit box .
norway owns the mountain and the facility , but the depositors own the seed .
and if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states , of canada , and an international institution from syria .
i think it 's interesting in that this facility , i think , is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries , literally , every country in the world — because we have seeds from every country in the world — all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that 's both long term , sustainable and positive .
i ca n't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way .
i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change , for the water crisis .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things , or the energy crisis , or world hunger , or peace in conflict .
i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that , but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we ca n't solve any of those problems if we do n't have crop diversity .
because i challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we do n't have crop diversity .
because , quite literally , if agriculture does n't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
and if crops do n't adapt to climate change , neither will agriculture , neither will we .
so , this is not something pretty and nice to do .
there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it .
it is , i agree , a nice thing to do .
but it 's a necessary thing to do .
so , in a very real sense , i believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task .
the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us , but it 's not the complete answer .
we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there .
we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future .
we need to catalog it . it 's a library of life , but right now i would say we do n't have a card catalog for it .
and we need to support it financially .
my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university , we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat .
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever .
so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
and my final thought is that we , of course , by conserving wheat , rice , potatoes , and the other crops , we may , quite simply , end up saving ourselves .
thank you .

so i wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when i was writing my new book , and it 's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago , when the kingdom of israel was in its infancy .
and it takes place in an area called the shephelah in what is now israel .
and the reason the story obsessed me is that i thought i understood it , and then i went back over it and i realized that i did n't understand it at all .
ancient palestine had a — along its eastern border , there 's a mountain range .
still same is true of israel today .
and in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region , so jerusalem , bethlehem , hebron .
and then there 's a coastal plain along the mediterranean , where tel aviv is now .
and connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the shephelah , which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west , and you can follow the shephelah , go through the shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains .
and the shephelah , if you 've been to israel , you 'll know it 's just about the most beautiful part of israel .
it 's gorgeous , with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards .
but more importantly , though , in the history of that region , it 's served , it 's had a real strategic function , and that is , it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way , get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains .
and 3,000 years ago , that 's exactly what happens .
the philistines , who are the biggest of enemies of the kingdom of israel , are living in the coastal plain .
they 're originally from crete . they 're a seafaring people .
and they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the shephelah up into the mountains , because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by bethlehem and split the kingdom of israel in two .
and the kingdom of israel , which is headed by king saul , obviously catches wind of this , and saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the philistines in the valley of elah , one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the shephelah .
and the israelites dig in along the northern ridge , and the philistines dig in along the southern ridge , and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other , because they 're deadlocked .
neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you 've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you 're completely exposed .
`` so finally , to break the deadlock , the philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor , and he calls out and he says to the israelites , `` '' send your mightiest warrior down , and we 'll have this out , just the two of us . '' '' this was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat . ''
it was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle .
and the philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
he 's 6 foot 9 .
he 's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor , and he 's got a sword and he 's got a javelin and he 's got his spear . he is absolutely terrifying .
and he 's so terrifying that none of the israelite soldiers want to fight him .
it 's a death wish , right ? there 's no way they think they can take him .
`` and finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy , and he goes up to saul and he says , `` '' i 'll fight him . '' '' and saul says , `` '' you ca n't fight him . that 's ridiculous . ''
`` you 're this kid . this is this mighty warrior . '' '' but the shepherd is adamant . he says , `` '' no , no , no , you do n't understand , i have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years . i think i can do it . '' '' and saul has no choice . he 's got no one else who 's come forward . ''
`` so he says , `` '' all right . '' '' and then he turns to the kid , and he says , `` but you 've got to wear this armor . you ca n't go as you are . '' ''
`` so he tries to give the shepherd his armor , and the shepherd says , `` '' no . '' '' he says , `` '' i ca n't wear this stuff . '' '' the biblical verse is , `` '' i can not wear this for i have not proved it , '' '' meaning , `` '' i 've never worn armor before . you 've got to be crazy . '' '' so he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd 's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant . ''
`` and the giant sees this figure approaching , and calls out , `` '' come to me so i can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field . '' '' he issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him . ''
and the shepherd draws closer and closer , and the giant sees that he 's carrying a staff .
that 's all he 's carrying .
`` instead of a weapon , just this shepherd 's staff , and he says — he 's insulted — `` am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? '' ''
and the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes — right here , in his most vulnerable spot — and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run .
and of course , the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
in fact , that term , david and goliath , has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger .
now why do we call david an underdog ?
well , we call him an underdog because he 's a kid , a little kid , and goliath is this big , strong giant .
we also call him an underdog because goliath is an experienced warrior , and david is just a shepherd .
but most importantly , we call him an underdog because all he has is — it 's that goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry , this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear , and all david has is this sling .
`` well , let 's start there with the phrase `` all david has is this sling , '' because that 's the first mistake that we make . ''
in ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
there 's cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
there 's heavy infantry , which are foot soldiers , armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor .
and there 's artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target .
that 's what david has , and it 's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot .
it 's not this , right ? it 's not a child 's toy .
it 's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
when david rolls it around like this , he 's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second , and that means that when the rock is released , it 's going forward really fast , probably 35 meters per second .
that 's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers .
more than that , the stones in the valley of elah were not normal rocks . they were barium sulphate , which are rocks twice the density of normal stones .
if you do the calculations on the ballistics , on the stopping power of the rock fired from david 's sling , it 's roughly equal to the stopping power of a [ .45 caliber ] handgun .
this is an incredibly devastating weapon .
accuracy , we know from historical records that slingers — experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards .
from medieval tapestries , we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight .
they were incredibly accurate .
when david lines up — and he 's not 200 yards away from goliath , he 's quite close to goliath — when he lines up and fires that thing at goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
if you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
so what 's goliath ? he 's heavy infantry , and his expectation when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he 's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman .
`` when he says , `` '' come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , '' '' the key phrase is `` '' come to me . '' '' come up to me because we 're going to fight , hand to hand , like this . ''
saul has the same expectation .
`` david says , `` '' i want to fight goliath , '' '' and saul tries to give him his armor , because saul is thinking , `` '' oh , when you say 'fight goliath , ' you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat , ' infantry on infantry . '' '' but david has absolutely no expectation . ''
he 's not going to fight him that way . why would he ?
he 's a shepherd . he 's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves .
that 's where his strength lies .
so here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
goliath is a sitting duck . he does n't have a chance .
so why do we keep calling david an underdog , and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable ?
there 's a second piece of this that 's important .
it 's not just that we misunderstand david and his choice of weaponry .
it 's also that we profoundly misunderstand goliath .
goliath is not what he seems to be .
there 's all kinds of hints of this in the biblical text , things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and do n't square with his image as this mighty warrior .
so to begin with , the bible says that goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant .
now that is weird , right ?
here is this mighty warrior challenging the israelites to one-on-one combat .
why is he being led by the hand by some young boy , presumably , to the point of combat ?
secondly , the bible story makes special note of how slowly goliath moves , another odd thing to say when you 're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point .
and then there 's this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath to react to the sight of david .
so david 's coming down the mountain , and he 's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
`` there is nothing about him that says , `` i am about to fight you like this . '' ''
he 's not even carrying a sword .
why does goliath not react to that ?
it 's as if he 's oblivious to what 's going on that day .
`` and then there 's that strange comment he makes to david : `` am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? '' ''
sticks ? david only has one stick .
well , it turns out that there 's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies .
there have been many articles written .
the first one was in 1960 in the indiana medical journal , and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for goliath 's height .
so goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the norm , there 's an explanation for it .
so the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly , and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone .
and throughout history , many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly .
so the tallest person of all time was a guy named robert wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11 .
he had acromegaly .
do you remember the wrestler andré the giant ?
famous . he had acromegaly .
there 's even speculation that abraham lincoln had acromegaly .
anyone who 's unusually tall , that 's the first explanation we come up with .
and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
the pituitary tumor , as it grows , often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain , with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted .
`` so when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with goliath , they 've said , `` '' wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . '' '' and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day . ''
why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant ?
because he ca n't make his way on his own .
why is he so strangely oblivious to david that he does n't understand that david 's not going to fight him until the very last moment ?
because he ca n't see him .
`` when he says , `` '' come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , '' '' the phrase `` '' come to me '' '' is a hint also of his vulnerability . ''
come to me because i ca n't see you .
`` and then there 's , `` '' am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? '' '' he sees two sticks when david has only one . ''
so the israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe .
what they did n't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness .
and there is , i think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
and sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
thank you .

fifty years ago , when i began exploring the ocean , no one — not jacques perrin , not jacques cousteau or rachel carson — imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
it seemed , at that time , to be a sea of eden , but now we know , and now we are facing paradise lost .
i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we 've lost — actually , we 've taken , we 've eaten — more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should concern you .
it does concern you , as well .
`` i 'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls `` '' tomorrow 's child , '' '' asking why we did n't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time . ''
well , now is that time .
i hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and , in so doing , secure hope for humankind .
health to the ocean means health for us .
and i hope jill tarter 's wish to engage earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe .
and i hope , jill , that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet .
( laughter ) did i say that ? i guess i did .
for me , as a scientist , it all began in 1953 when i first tried scuba .
it 's when i first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter .
i actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you do n't see in the daytime .
diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time — at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
in 1979 i had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called jim .
it was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
it 's one of my favorite bathing suits .
since then , i 've used about 30 kinds of submarines and i 've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .
i led a five-year national geographic expedition , the sustainable seas expeditions , using these little subs .
they 're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it .
and i 'm living proof .
astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air , food , water , temperature — all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea .
`` i heard astronaut joe allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system ; and then he pointed to this and he said , `` '' life support system . '' '' we need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it . ''
`` the poet auden said , `` '' thousands have lived without love ; none without water . '' '' ninety-seven percent of earth 's water is ocean . ''
no blue , no green .
if you think the ocean is n't important , imagine earth without it .
mars comes to mind .
no ocean , no life support system .
`` i gave a talk not so long ago at the world bank and i showed this amazing image of earth and i said , `` '' there it is ! the world bank ! '' '' that 's where all the assets are ! ''
and we 've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them .
tim worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .
with every drop of water you drink , every breath you take , you 're connected to the sea .
no matter where on earth you live .
most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea .
over time , most of the planet 's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there , mostly by microbes .
the ocean drives climate and weather , stabilizes temperature , shapes earth 's chemistry .
water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain , sleet and snow , and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world , maybe in the universe .
no water , no life ; no blue , no green .
yet we have this idea , we humans , that the earth — all of it : the oceans , the skies — are so vast and so resilient it does n't matter what we do to it .
that may have been true 10,000 years ago , and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especially in the last 50 , we 've drawn down the assets , the air , the water , the wildlife that make our lives possible .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what 's happening , showing us our impact on the earth .
i mean , first you have to know that you 've got a problem .
and fortunately , in our time , we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
and with knowing comes caring .
and with caring , there 's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us .
but first we have to know .
three years ago , i met john hanke , who 's the head of google earth , and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously .
`` but i asked him : `` '' when are you going to finish it ? ''
you did a great job with the land , the dirt .
`` what about the water ? '' '' since then , i 've had the great pleasure of working with the googlers , with doer marine , with national geographic , with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could enlist , to put the ocean in google earth . ''
and as of just this week , last monday , google earth is now whole .
consider this : starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we 're sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and california 's four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what 's below .
to see — wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! — right there , ha — under the ocean , see what the whales see .
we can go explore the other side of the hawaiian islands .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with humpback whales .
these are the gentle giants that i 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater .
there 's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale .
we can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the mariana trench , where only two people have ever been .
imagine that . it 's only seven miles , but only two people have been there , 49 years ago .
one-way trips are easy .
we need new deep-diving submarines .
how about some x prizes for ocean exploration ?
we need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
we can now go to the arctic .
just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole .
an ice-free arctic ocean may happen in this century .
that 's bad news for the polar bears .
that 's bad news for us too .
excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming , it 's also changing ocean chemistry , making the sea more acidic .
that 's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
also it 's bad news for us .
we 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
we 're clogging the ocean , poisoning the planet 's circulatory system , and we 're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife , all carbon-based units .
barbarically , we 're killing sharks for shark fin soup , undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle , the oxygen cycle , the water cycle — our life support system .
we 're still killing bluefin tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
all of these parts are part of our life support system .
we kill using long lines , with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers , taking everything in their path .
using google earth you can witness trawlers — in china , the north sea , the gulf of mexico — shaking the foundation of our life support system , leaving plumes of death in their path .
the next time you dine on sushi — or sashimi , or swordfish steak , or shrimp cocktail , whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean — think of the real cost .
for every pound that goes to market , more than 10 pounds , even 100 pounds , may be thrown away as bycatch .
this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
this chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 .
the highest concentrations are in red .
in my lifetime , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been killed .
most of the turtles , sharks , tunas and whales are way down in numbers .
but , there is good news .
ten percent of the big fish still remain .
there are still some blue whales .
there are still some krill in antarctica .
there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay .
half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape , a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet .
there 's still time , but not a lot , to turn things around .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs — and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
imagine the ocean without fish .
imagine what that means to our life support system .
natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , watersheds and wildlife .
and in 1872 , with yellowstone national park , the united states began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had .
about 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected : safeguarding biodiversity , providing a carbon sink , generating oxygen , protecting watersheds .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , national marine sanctuaries .
that 's another great idea .
the good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
and you can find them on google earth .
the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
in the last three years , for example , the u.s. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments .
but it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected , globally .
protected areas do rebound , but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish , sharks or sea bass , or 200-year-old orange roughy .
we do n't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens .
protected areas provide hope that the creatures of ed wilson 's dream of an encyclopedia of life , or the census of marine life , will live not just as a list , a photograph , or a paragraph .
with scientists around the world , i 've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing — and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever — to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future .
such as the arctic — we have one chance , right now , to get it right .
or the antarctic , where the continent is protected , but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill , whales and fish .
sargasso sea 's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows .
97 percent of the land in the galapagos islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing .
it 's true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf , which is now in serious trouble .
the high seas , where whales , tuna and dolphins travel — the largest , least protected , ecosystem on earth , filled with luminous creatures , living in dark waters that average two miles deep .
they flash , and sparkle , and glow with their own living light .
there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child .
the next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
to cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
we need new ways , better ways , to cope with poverty , wars and disease .
we need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
our fate and the ocean 's are one .
we need to do for the ocean what al gore did for the skies above .
a global plan of action with a world conservation union , the iucn , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places .
new technologies are needed to map , photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see .
the goal is to protect biodiversity , to provide stability and resilience .
we need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
we need , maybe , an expedition — a ted at sea — that could help figure out the next steps .
and so , i suppose you want to know what my wish is .
i wish you would use all means at your disposal — films , expeditions , the web , new submarines — and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas — hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean , the blue heart of the planet .
how much ?
some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
you decide : how much of your heart do you want to protect ?
whatever it is , a fraction of one percent is not enough .
my wish is a big wish , but if we can make it happen , it can truly change the world , and help ensure the survival of what actually — as it turns out — is my favorite species ; that would be us .
for the children of today , for tomorrow 's child : as never again , now is the time .
thank you .

i was only four years old when i saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life .
that was a great day for my mother .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
and grandma was even more excited .
throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood , and she had hand washed laundry for seven children .
and now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
my mother carefully opened the door , and she loaded the laundry into the machine , like this .
`` and then , when she closed the door , grandma said , `` '' no , no , no , no . ''
`` let me , let me push the button . '' '' and grandma pushed the button , and she said , `` '' oh , fantastic ! ''
i want to see this ! give me a chair !
`` give me a chair ! i want to see it , '' '' and she sat down in front of the machine , and she watched the entire washing program . ''
she was mesmerized .
to my grandmother , the washing machine was a miracle .
today , in sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
look , the homes are full of machines .
i ca n't even name them all .
and they also , when they want to travel , they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .
and yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
sometimes they do n't even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line .
there are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day .
`` and the richest people over there — there 's one billion people — and they live above what i call the `` '' air line , '' '' because they spend more than $ 80 a day on their consumption . ''
but this is just one , two , three billion people , and obviously there are seven billion people in the world , so there must be one , two , three , four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line .
they have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ?
`` i 've done the scrutiny of market data , and i 've found that , indeed , the washing machine has penetrated below the air line , and today there 's an additional one billion people out there who live above the `` '' wash line . '' '' ( laughter ) and they consume more than $ 40 per day . ''
so two billion have access to washing machines .
and the remaining five billion , how do they wash ?
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
because it remains hard work for women to wash .
they wash like this : by hand .
it 's a hard , time-consuming labor , which they have to do for hours every week .
and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home , or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off .
and they want the washing machine .
they do n't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity .
and there 's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma .
look here , two generations ago in sweden — picking water from the stream , heating with firewood and washing like that .
they want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
`` but when i lecture to environmentally-concerned students , they tell me , `` '' no , everybody in the world can not have cars and washing machines . '' '' how can we tell this woman that she ai n't going to have a washing machine ? ''
`` and then i ask my students , i 've asked them — over the last two years i 've asked , `` how many of you does n't use a car ? '' ''
`` and some of them proudly raise their hand and say , `` '' i do n't use a car . '' '' and then i put the really tough question : `` '' how many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets ? '' '' and no one raised their hand . ''
even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines .
( laughter ) so how come [ this is ] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ? what is special with this ?
i had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world .
here we are .
look here , you see the seven billion people up there : the air people , the wash people , the bulb people and the fire people .
one unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel — oil , coal or gas .
that 's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is .
and it 's 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them .
half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world 's population .
and these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
this group uses three , one each .
and they also have electricity .
and over there they do n't even use one each .
that makes 12 of them .
but the main concern for the environmentally-interested students — and they are right — is about the future .
what are the trends ? if we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use .
first , population growth .
second , economic growth .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
and [ with ] that you will get two extra , but that wo n't change the energy use very much .
what will happen is economic growth .
the best of here in the emerging economies — i call them the new east — they will jump the air line .
`` `` '' wopp ! '' '' they will say . ''
and they will start to use as much as the old west are doing already .
and these people , they want the washing machine .
i told you . they 'll go there .
and they will double their energy use .
and we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light .
and they 'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth .
but the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
and these 22 units — still the richest people use most of it .
so what needs to be done ?
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
it 's real .
of course they must be more energy-efficient .
they must change behavior in some way .
they must also start to produce green energy , much more green energy .
but until they have the same energy consumption per person , they should n't give advice to others — what to do and what not to do .
( applause ) here we can get more green energy all over .
this is what we hope may happen .
it 's a real challenge in the future .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
she 's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone — so happy that she even voted for her .
and she became dilma rousseff , the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world — moving from minister of energy to president .
if you have democracy , people will vote for washing machines .
they love them .
and what 's the magic with them ?
my mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day .
`` she said , `` '' now hans , we have loaded the laundry . ''
the machine will make the work .
`` and now we can go to the library . '' '' because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ? ''
you get books out of the machines , children 's books .
and mother got time to read for me .
`` she loved this . i got the `` '' abc 's '' '' — this is where i started my career as a professor , when my mother had time to read for me . ''
and she also got books for herself .
she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language .
and she read so many novels , so many different novels here .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
`` and what we said , my mother and me , `` '' thank you industrialization . ''
thank you steel mill .
thank you power station .
`` and thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . '' '' thank you very much . ''
( applause )
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
this fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health , and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers .
now , the diagram that you see here , i know it looks like some kind of sports play , but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program i developed .
and like writing software , we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria .
what this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize , as you 're seeing in this movie .
the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
now , what you ca n't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules , and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off .
and the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale , but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast , in larger colonies of bacteria , this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other , and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen .
you can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie , where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density .
our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards .
this particular movie and experiment we call the supernova , because it looks like an exploding star .
now , besides programming these beautiful patterns , i wondered , what else can we get these bacteria to do ?
and i decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer .
one of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors .
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
we started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit , and found that when orally delivered to mice , these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors .
we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics , and hence , the presence of the tumors , was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine , and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer .
we went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer , one that is challenging to detect otherwise .
now , since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors , we 've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors , and we 've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies .
altogether , imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer , or even other diseases .
our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research , and to share this vision , i worked with artist vik muniz to create the symbol of the universe , made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells .
ultimately , my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research .
thank you .

when i was seven years old , some well-meaning adult asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up .
`` proudly , i said : `` '' an artist . '' '' `` `` no , you do n't , '' '' he said , `` you ca n't make a living being an artist ! '' ''
my little seven-year-old picasso dreams were crushed .
but i gathered myself , went off in search of a new dream , eventually settling on being a scientist , perhaps something like the next albert einstein .
( laughter ) i have always loved math and science , later , coding .
and so i decided to study computer programming in college .
in my junior year , my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films .
it was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen .
`` i watched these films in wonder , transfixed , fireworks going off in my head , thinking , `` '' that is what i want to do with my life . '' '' the idea that all the math , science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with , was pure magic for me . ''
just two years later , i started working at the place that made those films , pixar animation studios .
it was here i learned how we actually execute those films .
we start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters , or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest .
and because it 's a three-dimensional world , we can move a camera around inside that world .
i was fascinated by all of it .
but then i got my first taste of lighting .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
i actually have icons of lights i move around in there .
here you can see i 've added a light , i 'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software , turn on shadows and placing the light .
as i place a light , i think about what it might look like in real life , but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story .
so it might look like this at first , but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work , in rough form it might look like this , and in final form , like this .
there 's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it .
it 's where we go from this to this .
it 's the moment where all the pieces come together , and suddenly the world comes to life as if it 's an actual place that exists .
this moment never gets old , especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist .
did you see wall-e ?
( laughter ) there he is .
as you can see , we can create any world that we want inside the computer .
we can make a world with monsters , with robots that fall in love , we can even make pigs fly .
( laughter ) while this is an incredible thing , this untethered artistic freedom , it can create chaos .
it can create unbelievable worlds , unbelievable movement , things that are jarring to the audience .
so to combat this , we tether ourselves with science .
we use science and the world we know as a backbone , to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable .
`` `` '' finding nemo '' '' is an excellent example of this . ''
a major portion of the movie takes place underwater .
but how do you make it look underwater ?
then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look .
one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water .
so we coded up a light that mimics this physics — first , the visibility of the water , and then what happens with the color .
objects close to the eye have their full , rich colors .
as light travels deeper into the water , we lose the red wavelengths , then the green wavelengths , leaving us with blue at the far depths .
in this clip you can see two other important elements .
the first is the surge and swell , or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water .
the second is the caustics .
these are the ribbons of light , like you might see on the bottom of a pool , that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean 's surface .
here we have the fog beams .
the other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics , so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light , it appears and disappears , lending a subtle , magical sparkle to the underwater .
you can see how we 're using the science — the physics of water , light and movement — to tether that artistic freedom .
but we are not beholden to it .
we considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood .
we realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with .
so here 's a traditionally colored underwater scene .
but here , we can take sydney harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what 's happening .
in this scene , it 's really important we see deep into the underwater , so we understand what the east australian current is , that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride .
because in the end , we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world , we 're trying to create a believable world , one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story .
we use science to create something wonderful .
we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder .
this guy , wall-e , is a great example of that .
he finds beauty in the simplest things .
but when he came in to lighting , we knew we had a big problem .
we got so geeked-out on making wall-e this convincing robot , that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect .
( laughter ) his binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has .
he does n't have a face or even traditional dialogue , for that matter .
so the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions .
we started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections .
he was starting to look glassy-eyed .
( laughter ) now , glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he 's capable of falling in love .
so we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars , trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem .
so we started with the lenses .
here 's the flat-front lens , we have a concave lens and a convex lens .
and here you see all three together , showing us all these reflections .
we tried turning them down , we tried blocking them , nothing was working .
you can see here , sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes — usually eve .
so we could n't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses .
so here we have eve on the first lens , we put eve on the second lens , it 's not working .
we turn it down , it 's still not working .
and then we have our eureka moment .
we add a light to wall-e that accidentally leaks into his eyes .
you can see it light up these gray aperture blades .
i have a question .
can a computer write poetry ?
this is a provocative question .
what is poetry ?
what is creativity ?
hands up if you think poem 1 was written by a human .
very brave of you , because the first one was written by the human poet william blake .
so let 's try another test .
again , you have n't got ages to read this , so just trust your gut .
poem 2 : oh ! kangaroos , sequins , chocolate sodas ! / you are really beautiful !
so if you think the first poem was written by a human , put your hand up .
ok .
and if you think the second poem was written by a human , put your hand up .
we have , more or less , a 50/50 split here .
it was much harder .
the answer is , the first poem was generated by an algorithm called racter , that was created back in the 1970s , and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o'hara , who happens to be one of my favorite human poets .
( laughter ) so what we 've just done now is a turing test for poetry .
the turing test was first proposed by this guy , alan turing , in 1950 , in order to answer the question , can computers think ?
so in 2013 , my friend benjamin laird and i , we created a turing test for poetry online .
it 's called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
but basically , it 's the game we just played .
and what are the results ?
well , turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human , then it passes the turing test for intelligence .
we have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human .
so , i think we have an answer to our question .
let 's play our third and final test .
again , you 're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human .
and poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called rkcp .
now before we go on , let me describe very quickly and simply , how rkcp works .
so , you give rkcp a source text , it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language , and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text .
it 's just raw material .
and nevertheless , it 's able to create a poem that seems more human than gertrude stein 's poem , and gertrude stein is a human .
so what we 've done here is , more or less , a reverse turing test .
so gertrude stein , who 's a human , is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer .
therefore , according to the logic of the reverse turing test , gertrude stein is a computer .
( laughter ) feeling confused ?
i think that 's fair enough .
so far we 've had humans that write like humans , we have computers that write like computers , we have computers that write like humans , but we also have , perhaps most confusingly , humans that write like computers .
so what do we take from all of this ?
do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein ?
or that gertrude stein is more of a computer than william blake ?
( laughter ) these are questions i 've been asking myself for around two years now , and i do n't have any answers .
but what i do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology .
so my first insight is that , for some reason , we associate poetry with being human .
`` so that when we ask , `` '' can a computer write poetry ? '' '' we 're also asking , `` '' what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category ? ''
`` how do we say who or what can be part of this category ? '' '' this is an essentially philosophical question , i believe , and it ca n't be answered with a yes or no test , like the turing test . ''
i also believe that alan turing understood this , and that when he devised his test back in 1950 , he was doing it as a philosophical provocation .
so my second insight is that , when we take the turing test for poetry , we 're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms , they 're pretty simple and have existed , more or less , since the 1950s .
what we are doing with the turing test for poetry , rather , is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness .
so , what i 've figured out , we 've seen this when earlier today , we say that william blake is more of a human than gertrude stein .
of course , this does n't mean that william blake was actually more human or that gertrude stein was more of a computer .
it simply means that the category of the human is unstable .
this has led me to understand that the human is not a cold , hard fact .
rather , it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time .
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
we show it emily dickinson , it gives emily dickinson back to us .
we show it william blake , that 's what it reflects back to us .
we show it gertrude stein , what we get back is gertrude stein .
more than any other bit of technology , the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it .
so i 'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently .
and much of the conversation is , can we build it ?
can we build an intelligent computer ?
can we build a creative computer ?
what we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer ?
but what we 've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact , that it 's an ever-shifting , concatenating idea and one that changes over time .
`` so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future , we should n't only be asking ourselves , `` can we build it ? '' ''
`` but we should also be asking ourselves , `` what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us ? '' ''
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it 's one that ca n't be answered with software alone , but i think requires a moment of species-wide , existential reflection .
thank you .
is there life beyond earth in our solar system ?
wow , what a powerful question .
you know , as a scientist — planetary scientist — we really did n't take that very seriously until recently .
`` carl sagan always said , `` it takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims . '' ''
and the claims of having life beyond earth need to be definitive , they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it .
so how do we make this journey ?
what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life .
the ingredients of life are : liquid water — we have to have a solvent , ca n't be ice , has to be liquid .
we also have to have energy .
we also have to have organic material — things that make us up , but also things that we need to consume .
so we have to have these elements in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life , in that moment when it starts , can spark and then grow and evolve .
well , i have to tell you that early in my career , when we looked at those three elements , i did n't believe that they were beyond earth in any length of time and for any real quantity .
why ? we look at the inner planets .
venus is way too hot — it 's got no water .
mars — dry and arid .
it 's got no water .
and beyond mars , the water in the solar system is all frozen .
but recent observations have changed all that .
it 's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look and really start to answer our life question .
so when we look out into the solar system , where are the possibilities ?
we 're concentrating our attention on four locations .
the planet mars and then three moons of the outer planets : titan , europa and small enceladus .
so what about mars ?
let 's go through the evidence .
well , mars we thought was initially moon-like : full of craters , arid and a dead world .
and so about 15 years ago , we started a series of missions to go to mars and see if water existed on mars in its past that changed its geology .
we ought to be able to notice that .
and indeed we started to be surprised right away .
our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past .
and in fact , curiosity — which has been roving on the surface now for about three years — has really shown us that it 's sitting in an ancient river bed , where water flowed rapidly .
and not for a little while , perhaps hundreds of millions of years .
and if everything was there , including organics , perhaps life had started .
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
and we were really excited when we saw that .
because it was n't red mars , it was gray material , it 's gray mars .
we brought it into the rover , we tasted it , and guess what ?
we tasted organics — carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur — they were all there .
so mars in its past , with a lot of water , perhaps plenty of time , could have had life , could have had that spark , could have grown .
and is that life still there ?
we do n't know that .
but a few years ago we started to look at a number of craters .
during the summer , dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters .
the more we looked , the more craters we saw , the more of these features .
we now know more than a dozen of them .
a few months ago the fairy tale came true .
we announced to the world that we know what these streaks are .
it 's liquid water .
these craters are weeping during the summer .
liquid water is flowing down these craters .
so what are we going to do now — now that we see the water ?
well , it tells us that mars has all the ingredients necessary for life .
in its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere — there was an ocean .
it has weeping water right now .
liquid water on its surface .
it has organics .
it has all the right conditions .
so what are we going to do next ?
we 're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on mars .
and now it 's more appealing than ever before .
as we move out into the solar system , here 's the tiny moon enceladus .
this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone , this area around the sun .
this is much further out .
this object should be ice over a silicate core .
but what did we find ?
cassini was there since 2006 , and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all .
enceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon .
what a fabulous environment .
cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume , and it measured silicate particles .
where does the silica come from ?
it must come from the ocean floor .
the tidal energy is generated by saturn , pulling and squeezing this moon — is melting that ice , creating an ocean .
but it 's also doing that to the core .
now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on earth as an analogy ...
are hydrothermal vents .
hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977 .
oceanographers were completely surprised .
and now there are thousands of these below the ocean .
what do we find ?
the oceanographers , when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents , they 're teeming with life , regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline — does n't matter .
so hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on earth .
so what about enceladus ?
well , we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time , and we believe it has hydrothermal vents with perhaps the right organic material , it is a place where life could exist .
and not just microbial — maybe more complex because it 's had time to evolve .
another moon , very similar , is europa .
galileo visited jupiter 's system in 1996 and made fabulous observations of europa .
europa , we also know , has an under-the-ice crust ocean .
galileo mission told us that , but we never saw any plumes .
but we did n't look for them .
hubble , just a couple years ago , observing europa , saw plumes of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere , just exactly like enceladus .
these moons , which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone , that are out in the solar system , have liquid water .
and if there are organics there , there may be life .
this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that for billions of years .
life started here on earth , we believe , after about the first 500 million , and look where we are .
these moons are fabulous moons .
another moon that we 're looking at is titan .
titan is a huge moon of saturn .
it perhaps is much larger than the planet mercury .
it has an extensive atmosphere .
it 's so extensive — and it 's mostly nitrogen with a little methane and ethane — that you have to peer through it with radar .
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
we see lakes ...
actually almost the size of our black sea in some places .
and this area is not liquid water ; it 's methane .
if there 's any place in the solar system where life is not like us , where the substitute of water is another solvent — and it could be methane — it could be titan .
well , is there life beyond earth in the solar system ?
we do n't know yet , but we 're hot on the pursuit .
the data that we 're receiving is really exciting and telling us — forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways .
i believe we 're on the right track .
that in the next 10 years , we will answer that question .
and if we answer it , and it 's positive , then life is everywhere in the solar system .
just think about that .
we may not be alone .
thank you .

many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see .
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
so before i talk about this car for the blind , let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
so about that time , the national federation of the blind , or nfb , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently .
`` we decided to give it a try , because we thought , `` '' hey , how hard could it be ? '' '' we have already an autonomous vehicle . ''
we just put a blind person in it and we 're done , right ?
( laughter ) we could n't have been more wrong .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch .
so to test this crazy idea , we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility .
and in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-off parking lot — even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
so with this success , we decided to take the next big step , to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads .
so how does it work ?
well , it 's a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simplify it .
so we have three steps .
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
now obviously the driver can not see , so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver .
for that , we use an initial measurement unit .
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration — like a human ear , inner ear .
we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
and we also use three laser range finders .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
one is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment — these are the lanes of the road , there 's the obstacles — and convey this information to the driver .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
but the problem is this : how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who can not see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
so for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology .
so starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system , a vibrating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
but today we 're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
so these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer — the direction and the intensity .
another device is called speedstrip .
so this is a chair — as a matter of fact , it 's actually a massage chair .
we gut it out , and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns , and we actuate them to convey information about the speed , and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you can not see the vibration , we actually put red led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening .
this is the sensory data , and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
but the problem is these are instructional cue devices .
so this is not really freedom , right ?
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
`` we call this the `` '' backseat-driver problem . '' '' so we 're moving away from the instructional cue devices , and we 're now focusing more on the informational devices . ''
a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called airpix .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
so it 's a small tablet , has many holes in it , and compressed air comes out , so it can actually draw images .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
actually , you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature .
so it 's actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
for this , we 're showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the airpix .
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
so basically that 's how it works .
so just a month ago , on january 29th , we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous daytona international speedway during the rolex 24 racing event .
we also had some surprises . let 's take a look .
( music ) ( video ) announcer : this is an historic day in january .
he 's coming up to the grandstand , fellow federationists .
( cheering ) ( honking ) there 's the grandstand now .
and he 's [ unclear ] following that van that 's out in front of him .
well there comes the first box .
now let 's see if mark avoids it .
he does . he passes it on the right .
third box is out . the fourth box is out .
and he 's perfectly making his way between the two .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
well this is what it 's all about , this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity .
he 's approaching the end of the run , makes his way between the barrels that are set up there .
( honking ) ( applause ) dennis hong : i 'm so happy for you .
mark 's going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
mark riccobono : yes .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
`` letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : `` now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) but sometimes — ( laughter ) but sometimes i also do get — i would n't call it hate mail — but letters of really strong concern : `` '' dr. hong , are you insane , trying to put blind people on the road ? ''
`` you must be out of your mind . '' '' but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle , and it 's not going to be on the road until it 's proven as safe as , or safer than , today 's vehicle . ''
and i truly believe that this can happen .
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
how are we going to handle insurance ?
how are we going to issue driver 's licenses ?
there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
of course , the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
the sensors that are used can see through the dark , the fog and rain .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
or for the blind , everyday home appliances — in the educational setting , in the office setting .
just imagine , in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what 's written and read using these non-visual interfaces .
this is priceless .
so today , the things i 've showed you today , is just the beginning .
thank you very much .
( applause )
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they 're supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it 's a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wilds of city hall .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
but really what they 're doing is they 're showing what 's possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
here it kind of looks like he 's looking for a date , but what he 's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he 's not very good at fighting fires when he 's covered in four feet of snow .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named erik michaels-ober , noticed something else , and that 's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it 's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you do n't , someone can steal it from you .
so it 's got cute little game dynamics on it .
this is a modest little app .
it 's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
but it 's doing something that no other government technology does .
it 's spreading virally .
there 's a guy in the i.t . department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
it 's very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
so he 's getting citizens to check on them .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this is n't how it normally goes .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that 's nothing .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it does n't work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that 's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better — not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
and that 's important .
but what 's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government — not as the problem of an ossified institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that 's great news , because , it turns out , we 're very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there 's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it 's not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
they have n't given up on government .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they 're not complaining about it , they 're fixing it .
and these folks know something that we 've lost sight of .
`` and that 's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we 're really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o'reilly , `` what we do together that we ca n't do alone . '' ''
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you 're one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
`` and because government ultimately derives its power from us — remember `` '' we the people ? '' '' — how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens . ''
now i did n't know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
well after two years , i 've come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it 's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city 's call center , as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program — in fact , they all do that — you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
so scott gets this call .
`` he types `` '' opossum '' '' into this official knowledge base . ''
he does n't really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
`` and finally , he says , `` '' look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? '' '' so that worked . so booya for scott . ''
but that was n't the end of the opossums .
boston does n't just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
now we did n't write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
`` so one day — this is an actual report — this came in : `` '' opossum in my trashcan . ca n't tell if it 's dead . ''
`` how do i get this removed ? '' '' but what happens with citizens connect is different . ''
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
`` and the next report we got said , `` '' i walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house . ''
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
`` goodnight sweet opossum . '' '' ( laughter ) pretty simple . ''
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it 's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
but it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
and i do n't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i 'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they 'd been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it 's not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
now how many times have we elected a political leader — and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected — and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that 's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top .
and what 's under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with such contempt .
but it 's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that 's working against us , this other thing , and then we 're disempowering ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we 're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that 's where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
so that 's occupythesec movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it 's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that 's a response to the sec 's request for comment on the financial reform bill .
that 's not being politically active , that 's being bureaucratically active .
now for those of us who 've given up on government , it 's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they 're going to face .
do we really think we 're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
we ca n't do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
and there 's a generation out there that 's grown up on the internet , and they know that it 's not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that 's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
they 're not fighting that battle that we 're all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they 're faced with the problem of government , they do n't care as much about using their voices .
they 're using their hands . they 're using their hands
to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we 're not just consumers , and we 're not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
we 're more than that , we 're citizens .
and we 're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
( applause )
now , if president obama invited me to be the next czar of mathematics , then i would have a suggestion for him that i think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country .
and it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
the mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
and at top of that pyramid , it 's calculus .
and i 'm here to say that i think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit — that all of our students , every high school graduate should know — should be statistics : probability and statistics .
( applause ) i mean , do n't get me wrong . calculus is an important subject .
it 's one of the great products of the human mind .
the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
and every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .
but i 'm here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives .
on the other hand , statistics — that 's a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
it 's risk . it 's reward . it 's randomness .
it 's understanding data .
i think if our students , if our high school students — if all of the american citizens — knew about probability and statistics , we would n't be in the economic mess that we 're in today . ( laughter ) ( applause ) not only — thank you — not only that ...
but if it 's taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
i mean , probability and statistics , it 's the mathematics of games and gambling .
it 's analyzing trends . it 's predicting the future .
look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
and it 's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics — the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data — that being probability and statistics .
in summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . and i mean it .
thank you very much .

the doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it .
so you get a pillbox .
you have some confidence , your physician has some confidence that this is going to work .
the company that invented it did a lot of studies , submitted it to the fda .
they studied it very carefully , skeptically , they approved it .
they have a rough idea of how it works , they have a rough idea of what the side effects are .
it should be ok .
you have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you 've been blue , have n't felt like yourself , you have n't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do .
`` your physician says , `` '' you know , i think you have some depression . ''
`` i 'm going to have to give you another pill . '' '' so now we 're talking about two medications . ''
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
after the drugs hit the market .
three ? five ? seven ?
why do i care about this problem ?
so let me tell you a data science story .
and it begins with my student nick .
`` let 's call him `` '' nick , '' '' because that 's his name . ''
( laughter ) nick was a young student .
`` i said , `` '' you know , nick , we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately , and we do n't have a great understanding . ''
they literally put on the web — publicly available , you could all download it right now — hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients , doctors , companies , pharmacists .
and these reports are pretty simple : it has all the diseases that the patient has , all the drugs that they 're on , and all the adverse events , or side effects , that they experience .
it is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in america today , but it 's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs .
`` so i said to nick , `` '' let 's think about glucose . ''
glucose is very important , and we know it 's involved with diabetes .
let 's see if we can understand glucose response .
i sent nick off . nick came back .
`` `` '' russ , '' '' he said , `` '' i 've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database , and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not . '' '' he did it . it was very simple , in a way . ''
`` he took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that do n't change glucose , and said , `` '' what 's the difference in their side effects ? ''
`` differences in fatigue ? in appetite ? in urination habits ? '' '' all those things conspired to give him a really good predictor . ''
`` `` '' but nick , there 's a problem . ''
it 's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose , because it 's core to our practice .
`` `` '' i thought you might say that , so i did one other experiment . ''
`` i looked at people in this database who were on two drugs , and i looked for signals similar , glucose-changing signals , for people taking two drugs , where each drug alone did not change glucose , but together i saw a strong signal . '' '' and i said , `` '' oh ! you 're clever . good idea . show me the list . '' '' and there 's a bunch of drugs , not very exciting . ''
so that 's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the fda database actually holds up .
we have a copy of it that 's ok for research , we removed identifying information .
`` and i said , `` '' let 's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose . '' '' now there are thousands and thousands of people in the stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin . ''
but we needed special patients .
we needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement , then got the second one and had another glucose measurement , all within a reasonable period of time — something like two months .
and when we did that , we found 10 patients .
however , eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second p — we call this p and p — when they got the second p .
either one could be first , the second one comes up , glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter .
and if it gets up to 120 , 125 , your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes .
so a 20 bump — pretty significant .
`` i said , `` '' nick , this is very cool . ''
and we said , let 's call our friends at harvard and vanderbilt , who also — harvard in boston , vanderbilt in nashville , who also have electronic medical records similar to ours .
let 's see if they can find similar patients with the one p , the other p , the glucose measurements in that range that we need .
god bless them , vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients , same trend .
harvard found 100 patients , same trend .
so at the end , we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly .
more interestingly , we had left out diabetics , because diabetics already have messed up glucose .
when we looked at the glucose of diabetics , it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter , not just 20 .
`` this was a big deal , and we said , `` '' we 've got to publish this . '' '' we submitted the paper . ''
it was all data evidence , data from the fda , data from stanford , data from vanderbilt , data from harvard .
we had not done a single real experiment .
but we were nervous .
so nick , while the paper was in review , went to the lab .
we found somebody who knew about lab stuff .
i do n't do that .
i take care of patients , but i do n't do pipettes .
they taught us how to feed mice drugs .
we took mice and we gave them one p , paroxetine .
we gave some other mice pravastatin .
and we gave a third group of mice both of them .
and lo and behold , glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice .
that was great , and the story could have ended there .
but i still have six and a half minutes .
they could and they should .
`` how would we ever determine that ? '' '' we said , well , what do you do ? ''
you 're taking a medication , one new medication or two , and you get a funny feeling .
`` you go to google and type in the two drugs you 're taking or the one drug you 're taking , and you type in `` '' side effects . '' '' what are you experiencing ? ''
google , i am sorry to say , denied our request .
so i was bummed .
`` i was at a dinner with a colleague who works at microsoft research and i said , `` '' we wanted to do this study , google said no , it 's kind of a bummer . '' '' he said , `` '' well , we have the bing searches . '' '' ( laughter ) yeah . ''
that 's great .
now i felt like i was — ( laughter ) i felt like i was talking to nick again .
he works for one of the largest companies in the world , and i 'm already trying to make him feel better .
we not only have bing searches , but if you use internet explorer to do searches at google , yahoo , bing , any ...
`` so we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they 're having hyperglycemia , like `` '' fatigue , '' '' `` '' loss of appetite , '' '' `` '' urinating a lot , '' '' `` '' peeing a lot '' '' — forgive me , but that 's one of the things you might type in . ''
`` so we had 50 phrases that we called the `` '' diabetes words . '' '' and we did first a baseline . ''
and it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the internet involve one of those words .
so that 's our baseline rate .
`` if people type in `` '' paroxetine '' '' or `` '' paxil '' '' — those are synonyms — and one of those words , the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words , if you already know that there 's that `` '' paroxetine '' '' word . ''
`` if it 's `` '' pravastatin , '' '' the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline . ''
`` if both `` '' paroxetine '' '' and `` '' pravastatin '' '' are present in the query , it goes up to 10 percent , a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in , and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words . ''
we published this , and it got some attention .
the reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches .
we brought this to the attention of the fda .
they were interested .
what do i take from this ? why tell this story ?
well , first of all , we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really , fundamentally , drug actions .
this will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use .
nick went on ; he 's a professor at columbia now .
he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs .
he found several very important interactions , and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions .
however , there 's a couple of things .
we do n't just use pairs of drugs at a time .
as i said before , there are patients on three , five , seven , nine drugs .
have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction ?
yes , we can do pair-wise , a and b , a and c , a and d , but what about a , b , c , d , e , f , g all together , being taken by the same patient , perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected ?
we really have no idea .
it 's a blue sky , open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs .
two more lessons : i want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists , through themselves , through their doctors , the people who allowed the databases at stanford , harvard , vanderbilt , to be used for research .
but we ca n't have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
and the final thing i want to say is , in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story .
the two drugs actually caused problems .
they increased glucose .
they could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes , and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together , perhaps not together , make different choices when you 're prescribing .
but there was another possibility .
we could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way .
we could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone , but together , instead of causing a side effect , they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that do n't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective .
if we think about drug treatment today , all the major breakthroughs — for hiv , for tuberculosis , for depression , for diabetes — it 's always a cocktail of drugs .
and so the upside here , and the subject for a different ted talk on a different day , is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments , new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better ?
thank you very much .

my journey to become a polar specialist , photographing , specializing in the polar regions , began when i was four years old , when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island , up by greenland .
there we lived with the inuit in the tiny inuit community of 200 inuit people , where [ we ] were one of three non-inuit families .
and in this community , we did n't have a television ; we did n't have computers , obviously , radio .
we did n't even have a telephone .
all of my time was spent outside with the inuit , playing .
the snow and the ice were my sandbox , and the inuit were my teachers .
and that 's where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm .
and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it .
`` i 'd like to share with you , for just two minutes only , some images , a cross-section of my work , to the beautiful music by brandi carlile , `` '' have you ever . '' '' i do n't know why national geographic has done this , they 've never done this before , but they 're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i 've just completed that is not published yet . ''
national geographic does n't do this , so i 'm very excited to be able to share this with you .
and what these images are — you 'll see them at the start of the slide show — there 's only about four images — but it 's of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest .
it 's pure white , but it 's not a polar bear .
it 's a spirit bear , or a kermode bear .
there are only 200 of these bears left .
they 're more rare than the panda bear .
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one .
i thought , my career 's over .
i proposed this stupid story to national geographic .
what in the heck was i thinking ?
so i had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what i was going to do in my next life , after i was a photographer , because they were going to fire me .
because national geographic is a magazine ; they remind us all the time : they publish pictures , not excuses .
( laughter ) and after two months of sitting there — one day , thinking that it was all over , this incredible big white male came down , right beside me , three feet away from me , and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it .
and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest .
he went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep .
and i actually got to sleep within three feet of him , just in the forest , and photograph him .
so i 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i 've done on the polar regions .
please enjoy .

my clock is ticking . ok , let 's stop .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
we 're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it 's at its lowest level .
and in fact , scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years , then they said 50 years .
now they 're saying the sea ice in the arctic , the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years .
and what does that mean ?
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
you glaze over with it .
and what i 'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this .
and i want people to understand and get the concept that , if we lose ice , we stand to lose an entire ecosystem .
projections are that we could lose polar bears , they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years .
and there 's no better , sexier , more beautiful , charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on .
polar bears are amazing hunters .
this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores .
there was no ice around .
but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it .
and this bear swam out to that seal — 800 lb . bearded seal — grabbed it , swam back and ate it .
and he was so full , he was so happy and so fat eating this seal , that , as i approached him — about 20 feet away — to get this picture , his only defense was to keep eating more seal .
and as he ate , he was so full — he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly — and as he ate inside one side of his mouth , he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth .
so as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive , but it 's the ice that 's disappearing .
we 're finding more and more dead bears in the arctic .
when i worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago , we never found dead bears .
and in the last four or five years , we 're finding dead bears popping up all over the place .
we 're seeing them in the beaufort sea , floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
i found a couple in norway last year . we 're seeing them on the ice .
these bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice .
here 's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere , and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice , which is great for them ; they 're safe at this point .
they 're not going to die of hypothermia .
they 're going to get to land .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem .
`` these ringed seals , these are the `` '' fatsicles '' '' of the arctic . ''
these little , fat dumplings , 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear .
and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here .
these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice .
they give birth inside the ice , and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice .
and here 's a picture of sick ice .
this is a piece of multi-year ice that 's 12 years old .
and what scientists did n't predict is that , as this ice melts , these big pockets of black water are forming and they 're grabbing the sun 's energy and accelerating the melting process .
and here we are diving in the beaufort sea .
the visibility 's 600 ft. ; we 're on our safety lines ; the ice is moving all over the place .
i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive .
but what 's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice , that big chunk of ice up in the corner .
in that one single piece of ice , you have 300 species of microorganisms .
and in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden .
it acts like the soil in a garden . it 's an inverted garden .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
here 's me in my office .
i hope you appreciate yours .
this is after an hour under the ice .
i ca n't feel my lips ; my face is frozen ; i ca n't feel my hands ; i ca n't feel my feet .
and i 've come up , and all i wanted to do was get out of the water .
after an hour in these conditions , it 's so extreme that , when i go down , almost every dive i vomit into my regulator because my body ca n't deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
and so i 'm just so happy that the dive is over .
`` i get to hand my camera to my assistant , and i 'm looking up at him , and i 'm going , `` '' woo . woo . woo . '' '' which means , `` '' take my camera . '' '' and he thinks i 'm saying , `` '' take my picture . '' '' so we had this little communication breakdown . ''
( laughter ) but it 's worth it .
i 'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales , bowhead whales , and narwhals , and polar bears , and leopard seals today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other i 've ever made .
i dropped down in this ice hole , just through that hole that you just saw , and i looked up under the underside of the ice , and i was dizzy ; i thought i had vertigo .
`` i got very nervous — no rope , no safety line , the whole world is moving around me — and i thought , `` '' i 'm in trouble . '' '' but what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice , giving birth and living out their entire life cycle . ''
this is the foundation of the whole food chain in the arctic , right here .
and when you have low productivity in this , in ice , the productivity in copepods go down .
this is a bowhead whale .
supposedly , science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now .
this very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution .
it could have survived 150 years of whaling .
and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we 're leading in the south .
narwhals , these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks , do n't have to be here ; they could be out on the open water .
but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe , catch a breath , because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod .
and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods .
alright , my favorite part .
when i 'm on my deathbed , i 'm going to remember one story more than any other .
even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , i do n't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals .
leopard seals , since the time of shackleton , have had a bad reputation .
they 've got that wryly smile on their mouth .
they 've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body .
they look positively prehistoric and a bit scary .
and tragically in [ 2003 ] , a scientist was taken down and drowned , and she was being consumed by a leopard seal .
`` and people were like , `` '' we knew they were vicious . we knew they were . '' '' and so people love to form their opinions . ''
and that 's when i got a story idea : i want to go to antarctica , get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake — find out if they really are these vicious animals , or if they 're misunderstood .
so this is that story .
oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
( laughter ) as a species , as humans , we like to say penguins are really cute , therefore , leopard seals eat them , so leopard seals are ugly and bad .
it does n't work that way .
the penguin does n't know it 's cute , and the leopard seal does n't know it 's kind of big and monstrous .
this is just the food chain unfolding .
they 're also big .
they 're not these little harbor seals .
they are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
and they 're also curiously aggressive .
you get 12 tourists packed into a zodiac , floating in these icy waters , and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon .
the boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked .
all the leopard seal was doing — it 's just biting a balloon .
it just sees this big balloon in the ocean — it does n't have hands — it 's going to take a little bite , the boat pops , and off they go .
( laughter ) so after five days of crossing the drake passage — is n't that beautiful — after five days of crossing the drake passage , we have finally arrived at antarctica .
i 'm with my swedish assistant and guide .
his name is goran ehlme from sweden — goran .
and he has a lot of experience with leopard seals . i have never seen one .
so we come around the cove in our little zodiac boat , and there 's this monstrous leopard seal .
`` and even in his voice , he goes , `` '' that 's a bloody big seal , ya . '' '' ( laughter ) and this seal is taking this penguin by the head , and it 's flipping it back and forth . ''
and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out , so it can eat the meat off the bones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin , came under the boat , the zodiac , starting hitting the hull of the boat .
and we 're trying to not fall in the water .
`` and we sit down , and that 's when goran said to me , `` '' this is a good seal , ya . ''
`` it 's time for you to get in the water . '' '' ( laughter ) and i looked at goran , and i said to him , `` '' forget that . '' '' but i think i probably used a different word starting with the letter `` '' f. '' '' but he was right . ''
`` he scolded me out , and said , `` '' this is why we 're here . ''
and you purposed this stupid story to national geographic .
and now you 've got to deliver .
`` and you ca n't publish excuses . '' '' so i had such dry mouth — probably not as bad as now — but i had such , such dry mouth . ''
and my legs were just trembling . i could n't feel my legs .
i put my flippers on . i could barely part my lips .
i put my snorkel in my mouth , and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water .
and this was the first thing she did .
she came racing up to me , engulfed my whole camera — and her teeth are up here and down here — but goran , before i had gotten in the water , had given me amazing advice .
`` he said , `` '' if you get scared , you close your eyes , ya , and she 'll go away . '' '' ( laughter ) so that 's all i had to work with at that point . ''
but i just started to shoot these pictures .
so she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened — she totally relaxed .
she went off , she got a penguin .
she stopped about 10 feet away from me , and she sat there with this penguin , the penguin 's flapping , and she let 's it go .
the penguin swims toward me , takes off .
she grabs another one . she does this over and over .
and it dawned on me that she 's trying to feed me a penguin .
why else would she release these penguins at me ?
and after she did this four or five times , she swam by me with this dejected look on her face .
`` you do n't want to be too anthropomorphic , but i swear that she looked at me like , `` '' this useless predator 's going to starve in my ocean . '' '' ( laughter ) so realizing i could n't catch swimming penguins , she 'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me , bobbing like this , and she 'd let them go . ''
this did n't work .
i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding , because i was crying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
and so that did n't work .
so then she 'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this . ( laughter ) and she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me .
this went on for four days .
this just did n't happen a couple of times .
and then so she realized i could n't catch live ones , so she brought me dead penguins .
( laughter ) now i 've got four or five penguins floating around my head , and i 'm just sitting there shooting away .
`` and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like , `` '' are you for real ? '' '' because she ca n't believe i ca n't eat this penguin . ''
because in her world , you 're either breeding or you 're eating — and i 'm not breeding , so ...
( laughter ) and then that was n't enough ; she started to flip penguins onto my head .
she was trying to force-feed me . she 's pushing me around .
she 's trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer 's dream .
and she would get frustrated ; she 'd blow bubbles in my face .
she would , i think , let me know that i was going to starve .
but yet she did n't stop .
she would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far , i got nervous because she came up to me , she rolled over on her back , and she did this deep , guttural jackhammer sound , this gok-gok-gok-gok .
and i thought , she 's about to bite .
she 's about to let me know she 's too frustrated with me .
what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me , and she did that to threat display .
she chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
( laughter ) that was n't the only seal i got in the water with .
i got in the water with 30 other leopard seals , and i never once had a scary encounter .
they are the most remarkable animals i 've ever worked with , and the same with polar bears .
and just like the polar bears , these animals depend on an icy environment .
i get emotional . sorry .
it 's a story that lives deep in my heart , and i 'm proud to share this with you .
and i 'm so passionate about it .
anybody want to come with me to antarctica or the arctic , i 'll take you ; let 's go .
we 've got to get the story out now . thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
thank you . thanks very much .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
something called the danish twin study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives , within certain biological limits , is dictated by our genes .
the other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle .
so the premise of blue zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity .
but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably could n't tell you .
they 've probably heard of the south beach diet , or the atkins diet .
you have the usda food pyramid .
there is what oprah tells us .
there is what doctor oz tells us .
the fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better .
should you be running marathons or doing yoga ?
should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
when it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
how about these hormones or resveratrol ?
and does purpose play into it ?
spirituality ? and how about how we socialize ?
well , our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic , and the national institute on aging , to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined .
and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do , to distill down the cross-cultural distillation .
and at the end of this i 'm going to tell you what that distillation is .
but first i 'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity .
and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
false .
the problem is , only about one out of 5,000 people in america live to be 100 .
your chances are very low .
even though it 's the fastest growing demographic in america , it 's hard to reach 100 .
the problem is that we 're not programmed for longevity .
we are programmed for something called procreative success .
i love that word .
it reminds me of my college days .
biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation , the age when your children have children .
after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates .
if you 're a mammal , if you 're a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it 's the same story .
so to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery .
the second myth is , there are treatments that can help slow , reverse , or even stop aging .
false .
when you think of it , there is 99 things that can age us .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
play tennis too hard , on your knees , ruin your cartilage , the cartilage never comes back .
our arteries can clog . our brains can gunk up with plaque , and we can get alzheimer 's .
there is just too many things to go wrong .
`` our bodies have 35 trillion cells , trillion with a `` '' t. '' '' we 're talking national debt numbers here . ''
( laughter ) those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage . and that damage builds up .
and it builds up exponentially .
it 's a little bit like the days when we all had beatles albums or eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape , and let our friends copy that cassette tape , and pretty soon , with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage .
well , the same things happen to our cells .
that 's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person .
so , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am i doing here ?
well , the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body , my body , your body , is about 90 years , a little bit more for women .
but life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
so somewhere along the line , we 're leaving about 12 good years on the table .
these are years that we could get .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
we think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them , areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are , areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years , the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country .
we found our first blue zone about 125 miles off the coast of italy , on the island of sardinia .
and not the entire island , the island is about 1.4 million people , but only up in the highlands , an area called the nuoro province .
and here we have this area where men live the longest , about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in america .
and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work , chop wood , and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them .
( laughter ) their history actually goes back to about the time of christ .
it 's actually a bronze age culture that 's been isolated .
because the land is so infertile , they largely are shepherds , which occasions regular , low-intensity physical activity .
their diet is mostly plant-based , accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields .
they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .
it 's called cannonau .
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society .
and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat older people .
you ever notice here in america , social equity seems to peak at about age 24 ?
just look at the advertisements .
here in sardinia , the older you get the more equity you have , the more wisdom you 're celebrated for .
you go into the bars in sardinia , instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar , you see the centenarian of the month calendar .
this , as it turns out , is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family — it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy — research shows it 's also good for the children of those families , who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease .
that 's called the grandmother effect .
we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet , about 800 miles south of tokyo , on the archipelago of okinawa .
okinawa is actually 161 small islands .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
this is a place where the oldest living female population is found .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
they have what we want .
they live a long time , and tend to die in their sleep , very quickly , and often , i can tell you , after sex .
they live about seven good years longer than the average american .
five times as many centenarians as we have in america .
one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer , big killers here in america .
and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us .
what do they do ?
once again , a plant-based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them .
and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do .
more significant than what they eat is how they eat it .
they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating , which , as you know , is a big problem here in america .
a few of the strategies we observed : they eat off of smaller plates , so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting .
instead of serving family style , where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking , they serve at the counter , put the food away , and then bring it to the table .
they also have a 3,000-year-old adage , which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented .
it was invented by confucius .
and that diet is known as the hara , hatchi , bu diet .
it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ 80 ] percent full .
it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain .
and by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing .
but , like sardinia , okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .
we know that isolation kills .
fifteen years ago , the average american had three good friends .
we 're down to one and half right now .
if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa , you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life .
they call it a moai . and if you 're in a moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , parent dies , you always have somebody who has your back .
this particular moai , these five ladies have been together for 97 years .
their average age is 102 .
typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two sections .
there is our work life , where we 're productive .
and then one day , boom , we retire .
and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to arizona to play golf .
in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement .
`` instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is `` '' ikigai . '' '' and , roughly translated , it means `` the reason for which you wake up in the morning . '' ''
for this 102-year-old karate master , his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art .
for this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week .
and this is a question . the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians .
and one of the questions , they were very culturally astute , the people who put the questionnaire .
`` one of the questions was , `` '' what is your ikigai ? '' '' they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning . ''
for this 102 year old woman , her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter .
two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years .
and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter .
`` and she put her head back and she said , `` it feels like leaping into heaven . '' ''
i thought that was a wonderful thought .
my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone .
and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota , where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians .
but that 's because all the young people left .
( laughter ) so , we turned to the data again .
and we found america 's longest-lived population among the seventh-day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda , california .
adventists are conservative methodists .
they celebrate their sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday .
`` a `` '' 24-hour sanctuary in time , '' '' they call it . ''
and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity , comparatively speaking .
in america here , life expectancy for the average woman is 80 .
but for an adventist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
and the difference is even more pronounced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their american counterparts .
now , this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years .
sterling study . and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project .
this is a heterogeneous community .
it 's white , black , hispanic , asian .
the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives .
they take their diet directly from the bible .
genesis : chapter one , verse [ 29 ] , where god talks about legumes and seeds , and on one more stanza about green plants , ostensibly missing is meat .
they take this sanctuary in time very serious .
for 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how stressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their god , their social network , and then , hardwired right in the religion , are nature walks .
and the power of this is not that it 's done occasionally , the power is it 's done every week for a lifetime .
none of it 's hard . none of it costs money .
adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists .
so , if you go to an adventist 's party you do n't see people swilling jim beam or rolling a joint .
instead they 're talking about their next nature walk , exchanging recipes , and yes , they pray .
but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham .
ellsworth whareham is 97 years old .
`` he 's a multimillionaire , yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence , he said , `` '' for that kind of money i 'll do it myself . '' '' so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement , and hauling poles around . ''
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
but not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing open-heart surgery .
at 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month .
ed rawlings , 103 years old now , an active cowboy , starts his morning with a swim .
and on weekends he likes to put on the boards , throw up rooster tails .
and then marge deton .
marge is 104 .
her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here .
she starts her day with lifting weights .
she rides her bicycle .
and then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 cadillac seville , and tears down the san bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .
i 've been on 19 hardcore expeditions .
i 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen .
but i 'll tell you , there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with marge deton .
`` `` '' a stranger is a friend i have n't met yet ! '' '' she 'd say to me . ''
so , what are the common denominators in these three cultures ?
what are the things that they all do ?
and we managed to boil it down to nine .
in fact we 've done two more blue zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true .
and the first one , and i 'm about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise .
instead , they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity .
these 100-year-old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day .
sardinians live in vertical houses , up and down the stairs .
every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk .
they do n't have any conveniences .
there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work .
if they want to mix up a cake , they 're doing it by hand .
that 's physical activity .
that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does .
when they do do intentional physical activity , it 's the things they enjoy . they tend to walk , the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline , and they all tend to have a garden .
they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .
each of these cultures take time to downshift .
the sardinians pray . the seventh-day adventists pray .
the okinawans have this ancestor veneration .
but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out , that triggers something called the inflammatory response , which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease .
when you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state .
they have vocabulary for sense of purpose , ikigai , like the okinawans .
you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born , because of infant mortality , and the year you retire .
these people know their sense of purpose , and they activate in their life , that 's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy .
there 's no longevity diet .
instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the american population .
( laughter ) they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
does n't mean they do n't eat meat , but lots of beans and nuts .
and they have strategies to keep from overeating , little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .
and then the foundation of all this is how they connect .
they put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
they all tend to belong to a faith-based community , which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month .
and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe .
they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people .
we know from the framingham studies , that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight .
so , if you hang out with unhealthy people , that 's going to have a measurable impact over time .
instead , if your friend 's idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they 're engaged , and they 're trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time .
diets do n't work . no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .
exercise programs usually start in january ; they 're usually done by october .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
but when you think about it , your friends are long-term adventures , and therefore , perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life , and life to your years . thank you very much .
( applause )
i 'm a man who 's trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
nelson mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
and so this talk is going to be for him .
i grew up in wonder .
i grew up amongst those animals .
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called londolozi game reserve .
it 's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations .
now for as long as i can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so i think it 's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
now my stories are not the stories that you 'll hear on the news , and while it 's true that africa is a harsh place , i also know it to be a place where people , animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world .
when i was nine years old , president mandela came to stay with my family .
he had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye , and it 's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi .
( laughter ) but it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
i would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
at night , i would sit with my family around the snowy , bunny-eared tv , and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly .
he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa , one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity .
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
`` through this act of immense open-heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call `` '' ubuntu . '' '' ubuntu : i am because of you . ''
or , people are not people without other people .
it 's not a new idea or value but it 's one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on .
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
ubuntu is at play right now .
you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am .
without you , i 'm just a guy talking to an empty room , and i spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it 's not the same as this .
( laughter ) if mandela was the national and international embodiment , then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man , solly mhlongo .
solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet .
solly grew up tending to his father 's cattle .
now , i can tell you , i do n't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for über-resourcefulness .
the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks .
where he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea , but he could do it .
he then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
he fixed roads , he mended wetlands , he did some anti-poaching .
and then one day we were out together , and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked .
and it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and i tell you , i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a ph.d.-level tracker .
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you 'd see he 'd stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
`` the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , `` solly , you are pathologically helpful . '' ''
( laughter ) when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment , solly was my tracker .
we worked together as a team .
`` and the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your east coast , and they said to solly , on the side , they said , `` '' before we even go out to see lions and leopards , we want to see where you live . '' '' so we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when solly 's wife , who was learning english , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , `` '' hello , i love you . ''
`` welcome , i love you . '' '' ( laughter ) and there was something so beautifully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it . ''
now on the day that solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
because of the heat , i took my shoes off , and i rolled up my pants , and i walked into the water .
solly remained on the bank .
the water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
and a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
`` and if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , `` '' do n't go in there . do n't go in there . '' '' ( laughter ) and of course , the crocodile was in the shadows . ''
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite .
wham ! it hits me by my right leg .
it pulls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i 'm able to grab a branch .
it 's shaking me violently .
it 's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you , and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that .
( laughter ) solly on the bank sees that i 'm in trouble .
he turns . he begins to make his way to me .
the croc again continues to shake me .
it goes to bite me a second time .
i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream .
as it bites the second time , i kick .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
i pull myself up into the branches , and as i come out of the water , i look over my shoulder .
my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
the bone is cracked .
the meat is torn up .
i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again .
as i come out of the water , solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
he knows , he sees the state of my leg , he knows that between him and i there is a crocodile , and i can tell you this man does n't slow down for one second .
he comes straight into the channel .
he wades in to above his waist .
he gets to me . he grabs me .
i 'm still in a vulnerable position .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
this is the other thing about solly , he 's freakishly strong .
he turns . he walks me up the bank .
he lays me down . he pulls his shirt off .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he 's able to get me to medical attention .
and i survive .
now — ( applause ) now i do n't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for solly , it was as natural as breathing .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
danger is shared . pain is shared .
joy is shared . achievement is shared .
houses are shared . food is shared .
ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
now although the root word is about people , i thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people .
and then i met this young lady .
her name was elvis .
in fact , solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance .
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route .
when i first saw her , i thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
and yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
and we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track .
it looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
and that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her , it was this sense of kinship .
and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
and yet still i remained amazed that she was surviving .
and then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
it was sort of a hollow in the ground .
and i watched as the matriarch drank , and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants , looks like the arm in motion , and she began to make her way up the steep bank .
the rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
and i watched young elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill .
she got visibly — ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
she attempted it a second time , and again , halfway up , she fell backwards .
and on the third attempt , an amazing thing happened .
halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
the next day i watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
and a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant .
what elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and i believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
if africa has a gift to share , it 's a gift of a more collective society .
and while it 's true that ubuntu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here .
thank you .
( applause ) pat mitchell : so boyd , we know that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today , and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world .
but i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
boyd varty : well thanks , pat .
i 'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
he was suffering .
and so of course there 's the mixed emotions .
but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about .
`` ( laughter ) and she was like , `` '' well , it 'll be about you . '' '' i mean , that 's just incredible humility . ( laughter ) ''
he was the father of our nation and we 've got a road to walk in south africa .
and everything , they used to call it madiba magic .
you know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
anywhere he went , things went well .
but i think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
and so that 's what i 'm going to try and do , and that 's what people all over south africa are trying to do .
pm : and that 's what you 've done today . bv : oh , thank you .
pm : thank you . bv : thank you . thanks very much .

( music ) for any of you who have visited or lived in new york city , these shots might start to look familiar .
this is central park , one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in america .
but to anyone who has n't visited , these images ca n't really fully convey .
to really understand central park , you have to physically be there .
well , the same is true of the music , which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park .
( music ) i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that 's us there . that 's both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
now , my brother and i , we 're musicians and music producers .
we 've been working together since , well , since we were kids , really .
but recently , we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect , from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts .
but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space .
but before i go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne-claude did their temporary installation , the gates , in central park .
hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks , and unlike work that 's exhibited in a more neutral space , like on the walls of a gallery or a museum , this was work that was really in dialogue with this place , and in a lot of ways , the gates was really a celebration of frederick olmsted 's incredible design .
this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time , and years later , my brother and i moved back to washington , d.c. , and we started to ask the question , would it be possible , in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park , to compose music for a landscape ?
which brought us to this .
`` ( music ) on memorial day , we released `` '' the national mall , '' '' a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device 's built-in gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington , d.c . ''
hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape , a musical score is actually unfolding around them .
so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park , but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory .
so think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
let 's take a closer look .
let 's look at one example here .
so using the app , as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument , you hear the sounds of instruments warming up , which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody .
this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
keep walking , and a full choir joins in , until you finally reach the top of the hill and you 're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness , as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park .
but were you to walk in the opposite direction , this entire sequence happens in reverse .
and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park , the music would fade to silence , and the play button would disappear .
we 're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who ca n't travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
well , unlike a normal album , we have n't been able to accommodate this request .
when they ask for a c.d . or an mp3 version , we just ca n't make that happen , and the reason is because this is n't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record .
in this case , the app is the work itself , and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience .
six months later , we did a location-aware album for central park , a park that is over two times the size of the national mall , with music spanning from the sheep 's meadow to the ramble to the reservoir .
currently , my brother and i are working on projects all over the country , but last spring we started a project , here actually at stanford 's experimental media art department , where we 're creating our largest location-aware album to date , one that will span the entirety of highway 1 here on the pacific coast .
but what we 're doing , integrating gps with music , is really just one idea .
but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age , that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model , but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music .
thank you .

i want you to imagine this for a moment .
and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists and psychologists , particularly in the developing world .
eric berlow : i 'm an ecologist , and sean 's a physicist , and we both study complex networks .
and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war , and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met .
and then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other talks out there , especially tedx talks , that are popping up all over the world .
how are they connected , and what does that global conversation look like ?
so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that .
sean gourley : exactly . so we took 24,000 tedx talks from around the world , 147 different countries , and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them .
and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other .
and so , of course , if you 're going to do this kind of stuff , you need a lot of data .
so the data that you 've got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comments , all the views , who 's watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comments .
but we can also pull up , using speech-to-text translation , we can pull the entire transcript , and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself .
so we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things .
we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extracting key concepts from this .
and we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea .
and we call that the meme-ome .
and the meme-ome , you know , quite simply , is the mathematics that underlies an idea , and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it , which i want to share with you now .
so each idea has its own meme-ome , and each idea is unique with that , but of course , ideas , they borrow from each other , they kind of steal sometimes , and they certainly build on each other , and we can go through mathematically and take the meme-ome from one talk and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk , and if there 's a similarity between the two of them , we can create a link and represent that as a graph , just like eric and i are connected .
so that 's theory , that 's great .
let 's see how it works in actual practice .
so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
and what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these , and we started to see where the connections occurred , where they connected with each other .
cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe .
we 've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east .
and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere .
so from this , we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection , but luckily , computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful .
eb : so i want to just point out here that every node is a talk , they 're linked if they share similar ideas , and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts , and then all these topics that pop out , they 're not from tags and keywords .
they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas . keep going .
sg : absolutely . so i got a little quick on that , but he 's going to slow me down .
we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media .
you 've got , of course , the human brain right next to healthcare , which you might expect , but also you 've got video games , which is sort of adjacent , as those two spaces interface with each other .
but i want to take you into one cluster that 's particularly important to me , and that 's the environment .
and i want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what 's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones .
the structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world .
so you 've got food economy and local food at the top , you 've got greenhouse gases , solar and nuclear waste .
what you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a broader concept of the environment .
and of course , from here , we can go and zoom in and see , well , what are young people looking at ?
and they 're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment .
if we split along gender lines , we can see females resonating heavily with food economy , but also out there in hope and optimism .
and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here , and i 'll throw to eric for the next part .
eb : yeah , i mean , just to point out here , you can not get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube .
let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
now often , when we 're faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
we might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
and a few rise to the surface .
there 's a talk about gratitude .
there 's another one about personal health and nutrition .
and of course , there 's got to be one about porn , right ?
and so then we might say , well , gratitude , that was last year .
what 's trending now ? what 's the popular talk now ?
and we can see that the new , emerging , top trending topic is about digital privacy .
so this is great . it simplifies things .
but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom .
and i hate that . how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting ?
well , we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that .
remember , it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics , and let 's say we could take two of them , like cities and genetics , and say , well , are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines .
and that 's — essentially , this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation .
well here 's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings .
it 's literally defining a new field .
and we could go back to those topics and say , well , what talks are central to those conversations ?
in the cities cluster , one of the most central was one by mitch joachim about ecological cities , and in the genetics cluster , we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter .
these are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline .
we could go the other direction and say , well , what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields .
we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this .
like , a talk by steven pinker on the history of violence , very synthetic .
and then , of course , there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere , in their own special place , and we call that the colleen flanagan index .
`` and if you do n't know colleen , she 's an artist , and i asked her , `` '' well , what 's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space ? '' '' and apparently it smells like bacon . ''
i would n't know .
so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique , ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields .
okay ? we never would have found those with our obsession with what 's trending now .
and all of this comes from the architecture of complexity , or the patterns of how things are connected .
sg : so that 's exactly right .
we 've got ourselves in a world that 's massively complex , and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it .
and those algorithms , whilst being kind of useful , are also very , very narrow , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
it has mathematical structure , and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what 's being said , to see what 's not being said , and to be a little bit more human and , hopefully , a little smarter .
thank you .

i have the answer to a question that we 've all asked .
the question is , why is it that the letter x represents the unknown ?
now i know we learned that in math class , but now it 's everywhere in the culture — the x prize , the x-files , project x , tedx .
where 'd that come from ?
about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language .
to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information .
that 's one of the reasons so much of what we 've come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
this includes the little system in arabic called al-jebra .
`` and al-jebr roughly translates to `` the system for reconciling disparate parts . '' ''
al-jebr finally came into english as algebra .
one example among many .
the arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to europe — which is to say spain — in the 11th and 12th centuries .
and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european language .
but there were problems .
one problem is there are some sounds in arabic that just do n't make it through a european voice box without lots of practice .
trust me on that one .
also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages .
here 's one of the culprits .
`` this is the letter sheen , and it makes the sound we think of as sh — `` '' sh . '' '' it 's also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means `` '' something '' '' just like the the english word `` '' something '' '' — some undefined , unknown thing . ''
`` now in arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article `` '' al . '' '' so this is al-shalan — the unknown thing . ''
and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs .
`` the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter sheen and the word shalan ca n't be rendered into spanish because spanish does n't have that sh , that `` '' sh '' '' sound . ''
`` so by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the ck sound , `` '' ck '' '' sound , from the classical greek in the form of the letter kai . ''
later when this material was translated into a common european language , which is to say latin , they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x .
and once that happened , once this material was in latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
but now we have the answer to our question .
why is it that x is the unknown ? x is the unknown
`` because you ca n't say `` '' sh '' '' in spanish . ''
( laughter ) and i thought that was worth sharing .
( applause )
so it does n't matter whatsoever .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
seven years ago , a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm working with three friends , and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online . '' '' and i said , `` '' ok , you guys spent the whole summer on this , right ? '' '' `` no , we all took internships just in case it does n't work out . '' ''
`` `` all right , but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate . '' ''
`` `` not exactly . we 've all lined up backup jobs . '' ''
six months go by , it 's the day before the company launches , and there is still not a functioning website .
and they ended up naming the company warby parker .
( laughter ) they sell glasses online .
they were recently recognized as the world 's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars .
why was i so wrong ?
`` to find out , i 've been studying people that i come to call `` '' originals . '' '' originals are nonconformists , people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them . ''
they are people who stand out and speak up .
originals drive creativity and change in the world .
they 're the people you want to bet on .
and they look nothing like i expected .
i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them .
so the first reason that i passed on warby parker was they were really slow getting off the ground .
now , you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator .
well , i have a confession for you . i 'm the opposite . i 'm a precrastinator .
yes , that 's an actual term .
i just feel that a few months ahead of time .
( laughter ) so this started early : when i was a kid , i took nintendo games very seriously .
i would wake up at 5am , start playing and not stop until i had mastered them .
eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo , starring me .
( laughter ) ( applause ) since then , i have traded hair for teeth . ( laughter )
but this served me well in college , because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline .
and i was proud of that , until a few years ago .
`` i had a student named jihae , who came to me and said , `` i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating . '' ''
so i challenged her to get some data .
she goes into a bunch of companies .
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are .
and sure enough , the precrastinators like me , who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately .
so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators .
`` she was like , `` '' i do n't know . they did n't fill out my survey . '' '' ( laughter ) no , here are our results . ''
you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they do n't have any new ideas .
and on the flip side , the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they do n't have original thoughts either .
there 's a sweet spot where originals seem to live .
why is this ?
to find out , we designed some experiments .
and some of them are asked to do the task right away .
and sure enough , the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups .
( laughter ) and then i worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal .
it was agony .
but when i came back to it , i had all sorts of new ideas .
`` as aaron sorkin put it , `` you call it procrastinating . i call it thinking . '' ''
and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators .
take leonardo da vinci .
he toiled on and off for 16 years on the mona lisa .
he felt like a failure .
he wrote as much in his journal .
but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter .
he 's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage , and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines .
that was not in the script .
by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute , he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas .
and because the text was n't set in stone , he had freedom to improvise .
procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity , but it can be a virtue for creativity .
what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish .
and this is what i missed with warby parker .
what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent , compared with only 8 percent for the improvers .
look at facebook , waiting to build a social network until after myspace and friendster .
look at google , waiting for years after altavista and yahoo .
it 's much easier to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch .
so the lesson i learned is that to be original you do n't have to be first .
you just have to be different and better .
they had backup plans lined up , and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original , because i expected that originals would look something like this .
and so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four .
well , there 's a clue , it turns out , in the internet browser that you use .
yes .
why ? it 's not a technical advantage .
the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge .
it 's about how you got the browser .
because if you use internet explorer or safari , those came preinstalled on your computer , and you accepted the default option that was handed to you .
`` so people hear about this study and they 're like , `` great , if i want to get better at my job , i just need to upgrade my browser ? '' ''
and if you do that well , you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu .
there 's a name for it . it 's called vuja de .
( laughter ) vuja de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes .
it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that ca n't get the green light for more than half a century .
in every past version , the main character has been an evil queen .
but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
so there 's a simple message from this story .
when you feel doubt , do n't let it go .
( laughter ) what about fear ?
originals feel fear , too .
they 're afraid of failing , but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they 're even more afraid of failing to try .
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all .
they know that in the long run , our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions .
elon musk told me recently , he did n't expect tesla to succeed .
but i have some good news for you .
you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas .
a lot of people think they will .
they were afraid of embarrassing themselves , of looking stupid .
but guess what ? originals have lots and lots of bad ideas , tons of them , in fact .
take the guy who invented this .
no . you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb .
( laughter ) if you look across fields , the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most , because they 're the ones who try the most .
take classical composers , the best of the best .
why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times ?
the more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
even the three icons of classical music — bach , beethoven , mozart — had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces .
now , you may be wondering , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
i do n't know how wagner pulled that off .
so if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
they feel fear and doubt . they procrastinate .
they have bad ideas .
and sometimes , it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed .
do n't write them off .
and when that 's you , do n't count yourself out either .
look , being original is not easy , but i have no doubt about this : it 's the best way to improve the world around us .
thank you .

in the year 1901 , a woman called auguste was taken to a medical asylum in frankfurt .
auguste was delusional and could n't remember even the most basic details of her life .
her doctor was called alois .
alois did n't know how to help auguste , but he watched over her until , sadly , she passed away in 1906 .
after she died , alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain — the likes of which he 'd never seen before .
now here 's the even more striking thing .
if auguste had instead been alive today , we could offer her no more help than alois was able to 114 years ago .
alois was dr. alois alzheimer .
since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
we 've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , many treatments for cancer , antiretrovirals for hiv , statins for heart disease and much more .
but we 've made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer 's disease .
i 'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for alzheimer 's for over a decade .
alzheimer 's now affects 40 million people worldwide .
but by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you .
if you 're hoping to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting alzheimer 's will be almost one in two .
in other words , odds are you 'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with alzheimer 's .
one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer 's .
it may surprise you that , put simply , alzheimer 's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation .
but we 've done relatively little to address it .
today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , alzheimer 's is the only one we can not prevent , cure or even slow down .
we understand less about the science of alzheimer 's than other diseases because we 've invested less time and money into researching it .
the us government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimer 's despite the fact that alzheimer 's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer .
the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer 's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
remember dr. alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain a century ago .
for almost a century , we did n't know much about these .
today we know they 're made from protein molecules .
you can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami .
there are spots on the paper that are sticky .
and when it folds correctly , these sticky bits end up on the inside .
but sometimes things go wrong , and some sticky bits are on the outside .
this causes the protein molecules to stick to each other , forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles .
that 's what we see in the brains of alzheimer 's patients .
we 've spent the past 10 years at the university of cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works .
there are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex — like defusing a bomb .
cutting one wire might do nothing .
cutting others might make the bomb explore .
we have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it .
until recently , we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best .
but now we 've got together a diverse group of people — medics , biologists , geneticists , chemists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians .
and together , we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .
now let me show you some of our latest results .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
let 's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
so these are healthy worms , and you can see they 're moving around normally .
these worms , on the other hand , have protein molecules sticking together inside them — like humans with alzheimer 's .
and you can see they 're clearly sick .
but if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage , then we see that they 're healthy , and they live a normal lifespan .
this is n't about scientists like me — it 's about you .
that was essential for advancing treatment for hiv in the late 1980s .
today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
but alzheimer 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
and their families , the hidden victims , caring for their loved ones night and day , are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change .
so , it really is down to you .
everyone with a brain is at risk .
today , there are 40 million patients like auguste , who ca n't create the change they need for themselves .
help speak up for them , and help demand a cure .
thank you .

my travels to afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , poland .
i was walking through the forests of my grandmother 's tales .
a land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century .
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
i met humble people .
i heard their prayer and ate their bread .
then i have been walking east for 20 years — from eastern europe to central asia — through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
and i ever met more humble people .
and i shared their bread and their prayer .
this is why i went to afghanistan .
one day , i crossed the bridge over the oxus river .
i was alone on foot .
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .
but he gave me a cup of tea .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
so i have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from iran 's border to the bottom , to the edge of the wakhan corridor .
and in this way i could find noor , the hidden light of afghanistan .
my only weapon was my notebook and my leica .
i heard prayers of the sufi — humble muslims , hated by the taliban .
hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from gibraltar to india .
the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears , and welcomed as a gift .
what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ?
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
these are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for afghan businessmen .
what do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?
clothed in this nylon bag , made in china , with the name of burqa .
i saw one day , the largest school in afghanistan , a girls ' school .
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions .
and their love [ for studying ] was so big that i cried .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
the region is not secure , but full of the taliban , and they did it .
my aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict .
thanks .

`` and that happened a lot : `` you pommies , you ca n't play cricket , rugby . '' ''
and of course , they were right .
but it 's not just australia that has better health than britain .
within britain , there is a gradient of health — and this is what 's called standardized mortality , basically your chances of dying .
this is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago , but it 's true today .
now , we know about smoking , deep-fried mars bars , chips — the glasgow diet .
but this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors .
and we need vitamin d. it 's now a requirement that children have a certain amount .
and i as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother .
i distinctly — nobody forgets cod liver oil .
there seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin d is very good for you .
and it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
it 's not the only reason preventing heart disease .
anyway , i came back from australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , i moved to aberdeen .
but i also became interested in research , and in particular i became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
and they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter , nitric oxide .
what nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels , so it lowers your blood pressure .
it also dilates the coronary arteries , so it stops angina .
and i started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
how do you have low blood pressure in your skin ?
we thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death , and how cells survive , and their resistance to other things .
so they 're really an ideal model .
could the sun activate those stores into the circulation , and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system ?
and so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light .
so these are kind of sunlamps .
so we used ultraviolet a , which does n't make vitamin d .
but certainly in people older than my wife , this appears to be a more marked effect .
there is no change in blood flow , in dilatation of the blood vessels .
but the active irradiation , during the uv and for an hour after it , there is dilation of the blood vessels .
different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that .
so you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that .
in winter or summer , it 's the same amount of light .
so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that 's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation .
so if you 're on the equator , december or june , you 've got masses of no being released from the skin .
so ventura is in southern california .
we 're still working at this story , we 're still developing it , we 're still expanding it .
we think it 's very important .
and this is ongoing work , but dermatologists — i mean , i 'm a dermatologist .
`` `` '' why ? '' '' is a question that parents ask me all the time . ''
`` `` why did my child develop autism ? '' ''
as a pediatrician , as a geneticist , as a researcher , we try and address that question .
that same diagnosis of autism , though , also applies to gabriel , another 13-year-old boy who has quite a different set of challenges .
he 's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics .
he does n't make eye contact .
he has difficulty starting a conversation , feels awkward , and when he gets nervous , he actually shuts down .
yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder .
one of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism .
these days , one in 88 children will be diagnosed with autism , and the question is , why does this graph look this way ?
has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism , simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply did n't have that label ?
and in fact , in the late 1980s , the early 1990s , legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources , with access to educational materials that would help them .
as a result of that , more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed .
in addition , we 've changed our definition over time , so in fact we 've widened the definition of autism , and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see .
the next question everyone wonders is , what caused autism ?
and a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism .
but let me be very clear : vaccines do not cause autism .
( applause ) in fact , the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent .
it was actually retracted from the journal lancet , in which it was published , and that author , a physician , had his medical license taken away from him .
furthermore , one of the ingredients in vaccines , something called thimerosal , was thought to be what the cause of autism was .
that was actually removed from vaccines in the year 1992 , and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism .
so the question remains , what does cause autism ?
in fact , there 's probably not one single answer .
based on epidemiological data , we know that one of the causes , or one of the associations , i should say , is advanced paternal age , that is , increasing age of the father at the time of conception .
in particular , there 's a medication , valproic acid , which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take , we know can increase that risk of autism .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
and one of the things i 'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism .
i 'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism , but it 's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene .
one of the genetic factors that we do n't understand , however , is the difference that we see in terms of males and females .
males are affected four to one compared to females with autism , and we really do n't understand what that cause is .
one of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate .
and we can look in particular at three types of siblings : identical twins , twins that actually share 100 percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment , versus fraternal twins , twins that actually share 50 percent of their genetic information , versus regular siblings , brother-sister , sister-sister , also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information , yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment .
and when you look at those concordance ratios , one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins , that concordance rate is 77 percent .
it is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism , but yet they account for a lot of that risk , because when you look at fraternal twins , that concordance rate is only 31 percent .
on the other hand , there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings , suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone .
so this provides some of the data that autism is genetic .
when we compare it to other conditions that we 're familiar with , things like cancer , heart disease , diabetes , in fact , genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions .
but with this , that does n't tell us what the genes are .
it does n't even tell us in any one child , is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes ?
and so in fact , in some individuals with autism , it is genetic !
that is , that it is one single , powerful , deterministic gene that causes the autism .
however , in other individuals , it 's genetic , that is , that it 's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism .
we do n't know in any one person , necessarily , which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper .
so the question becomes , how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are .
in certain individuals , they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family .
and the reason is because in certain individuals , they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father , but actually start brand new in them , mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family .
and we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals .
so in fact , at the simons foundation , we took 2,600 individuals that had no family history of autism , and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases ?
to do that , we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother , the father and the child .
in doing so , i apologize , i 'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than wikipedia , but i 'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory , we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information .
our genetic information is organized into a set of 46 volumes , and when we did that , we had to be able to account for each of those 46 volumes , because in some cases with autism , there 's actually a single volume that 's missing .
we had to get more granular than that , though , and so we had to start opening those books , and in some cases , the genetic change was more subtle .
it might have been a single paragraph that was missing , or yet , even more subtle than that , a single letter , one out of three billion letters that was changed , that was altered , yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior .
in doing this within these families , we were able to account for approximately 25 percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families .
on the other hand , there 's 75 percent that we still have n't figured out .
as we did this , though , it was really quite humbling , because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism .
in fact , the current estimates are that there are 200 to 400 different genes that can cause autism .
and that explains , in part , why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects .
although there are that many genes , there is some method to the madness .
it 's not simply random 200 , 400 different genes , but in fact they fit together .
they fit together in a pathway .
they fit together in a network that 's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions .
but early diagnosis is a key for us .
being able to make that diagnosis of someone who 's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform , to be able to impact that growing , developing brain is critical .
and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants , small babies , and be able to use biomarkers , in this case eye contact and eye tracking , to identify an infant at risk .
`` this particular infant , you can see , making very good eye contact with this woman as she 's singing `` '' itsy , bitsy spider , '' '' in fact is not going to develop autism . ''
this baby we know is going to be in the clear .
on the other hand , this other baby is going to go on to develop autism .
in this particular child , you can see , it 's not making good eye contact .
instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection , looking at the mouth , looking at the nose , looking off in another direction , but not again socially connecting , and being able to do this on a very large scale , screen infants , screen children for autism , through something very robust , very reliable , is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact .
how are we going to intervene ?
it 's probably going to be a combination of factors .
in part , in some individuals , we 're going to try and use medications .
beyond just drugs , we 're going to use educational strategies .
individuals with autism , some of them are wired a little bit differently .
they learn in a different way .
they absorb their surroundings in a different way , and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best .
all of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism , but yet we have a long way to go .
as much as we know , there is so much more that we do n't know , and so i invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference , and in particular , for the individuals in families with autism , i invite you to join the interactive autism network , to be part of the solution to this , because it 's going to take really a lot of us to think about what 's important , what 's going to be a meaningful difference .
thank you .
what 's in the box ?
whatever it is must be pretty important , because i 've traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
( laughter ) ( applause ) sound familiar ?
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
three times .
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
nope .
there 's a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq . ft. industry : that of personal storage .
so we 've got triple the space , but we 've become such good shoppers that we need even more space .
so where does this lead ?
lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way , that less might actually equal more .
i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college — in your dorm , traveling — in a hotel room , camping — rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
it 's actually a great way to save you some money .
and it 's going to give you a little more ease in your life .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq . ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
i wanted it all — home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
with over 300 entries from around the world , i got it , my own little jewel box .
by buying a space that was 420 sq . ft .
instead of 600 , immediately i 'm saving 200 grand .
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities — save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
and because it 's really designed around an edited set of possessions — my favorite stuff — and really designed for me , i 'm really excited to be there .
so how can you live little ?
three main approaches .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives .
and that shirt that i had n't worn in years ?
it 's time for me to let it go .
we 've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow .
we need to think before we buy .
`` ask ourselves , `` is that really going to make me happier ? truly ? '' ''
by all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
but we want stuff that we 're going to love for years , not just stuff .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
we want space efficiency .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
you can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear — it 's magic .
finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares — a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed — same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
look at the coffee table — it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
guests ? move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
and of course , my own movie theater .
so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq . ft .
but consider the benefits of an edited life .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
`` so when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , `` '' could i do with a little life editing ? ''
would that give me a little more freedom ?
`` maybe a little more time ? '' '' what 's in the box ? ''
it does n't really matter .
i know i do n't need it .
what 's in yours ?
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
so let 's make room for the good stuff .
thank you .

when i was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
and as a special treat , he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .
and there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands .
and that day i knew that when i grew up , i was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
years later , when i finally grew up , my dream came true .
and it was while i was doing my ph.d .
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today .
it is estimated that one in six children , that 's one in six children , suffer from some developmental disorder .
this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments .
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
but here 's what really perplexed me .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .
it seemed so intuitive to me .
to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly .
looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete , or even a misleading , picture of the child 's problems .
yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
their groundbreaking technology records the eeg , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition .
a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain .
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms .
and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team , and we 're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders .
and i 'm happy to say that i 'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india .
i 'd like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by abc news .
seven-year-old justin senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body .
there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially , and he would probably never have too much language .
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain , the results were startling .
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic .
he was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism .
after justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures .
these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin .
all these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism , attention deficit disorder , mental retardation , language problems .
instead , our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that could n't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment .
for too long now , children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen .
and for too long , these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation .
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .
so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
one more mind will be unlocked .
and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there 's still time for his or her brain to recover .
and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves .
thank you .

imagine if you could record your life — everything you said , everything you did , available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips , so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them , or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered .
well that 's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago .
this is my wife and collaborator , rupal .
and on this day , at this moment , we walked into the house with our first child , our beautiful baby boy .
and we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system .
( video ) man : okay .
deb roy : this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house , if you looked up , you 'd see a camera and a microphone , and if you looked down , you 'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .
here 's our living room , the baby bedroom , kitchen , dining room and the rest of the house .
and all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture .
so here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and , finally , lights out for the day .
over the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours a day , amassing roughly a quarter-million hours of multi-track audio and video .
so you 're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made .
( laughter ) and what this data represents for our family at a personal level , the impact has already been immense , and we 're still learning its value .
countless moments of unsolicited natural moments , not posed moments , are captured there , and we 're starting to learn how to discover them and find them .
but there 's also a scientific reason that drove this project , which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language — that child being my son .
and so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data , we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at mit so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set , trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition .
so we 're looking here at one of the first things we started to do .
this is my wife and i cooking breakfast in the kitchen , and as we move through space and through time , a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen .
in order to convert this opaque , 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see , we use motion analysis to pull out , as we move through space and through time , what we call space-time worms .
and this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data , and with it , trace the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could focus our transcription efforts , all of the speech environment around my son — all of the words that he heard from myself , my wife , our nanny , and over time , the words he began to produce .
so with that technology and that data and the ability to , with machine assistance , transcribe speech , we 've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts .
and with that , let me take you now for a first tour into the data .
so you 've all , i 'm sure , seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time .
i 'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form .
`` my son , soon after his first birthday , would say `` '' gaga '' '' to mean water . ''
`` and over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , `` '' water . '' '' so we 're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds . ''
no video here , so you can focus on the sound , the acoustics , of a new kind of trajectory : gaga to water .
( audio ) baby : gagagagagaga gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water .
dr : he sure nailed it , did n't he .
( applause ) so he did n't just learn water .
over the course of the 24 months , the first two years that we really focused on , this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order .
and because we have full transcripts , we 've identified each of the 503 words that he learned to produce by his second birthday .
he was an early talker .
and so we started to analyze why .
why were certain words born before others ?
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is , on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances .
and the [ horizontal ] axis is time .
and all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
and we would plot the relative length of the utterances .
and what we found was this curious phenomena , that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum , making language as simple as possible , and then slowly ascend back up in complexity .
and the amazing thing was that bounce , that dip , lined up almost precisely with when each word was born — word after word , systematically .
so it appears that all three primary caregivers — myself , my wife and our nanny — were systematically and , i would think , subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .
and the implications of this — there are many , but one i just want to point out , is that there must be amazing feedback loops .
of course , my son is learning from his linguistic environment , but the environment is learning from him .
that environment , people , are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now .
but that 's looking at the speech context .
what about the visual context ?
we 're not looking at — think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house .
we 've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras , and we 've done some optical correction , and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life .
so welcome to my home .
this is a moment , one moment captured across multiple cameras .
the reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine , where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video-life into this system .
what i 'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes , again , of just life in the living room .
that 's me and my son on the floor .
and there 's video analytics that are tracking our movements .
my son is leaving red ink . i am leaving green ink .
we 're now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
and finally , my son playing in a walking toy by himself .
now we freeze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the vertical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we 've just left behind .
`` and we see these amazing structures — these little knots of two colors of thread we call `` '' social hot spots . '' '' the spiral thread we call a `` '' solo hot spot . '' '' and we think that these affect the way language is learned . ''
what we 'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they 're learned — so in other words , the relationship between words and what they 're about in the world .
so here 's how we 're approaching this .
in this video , again , my son is being traced out .
he 's leaving red ink behind .
and there 's our nanny by the door .
( video ) nanny : you want water ? ( baby : aaaa . ) nanny : all right . ( baby : aaaa . ) dr : she offers water , and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water .
`` and what we 've done is use the word `` '' water '' '' to tag that moment , that bit of activity . ''
and now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in , and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water .
and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
we call these wordscapes .
this is the wordscape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
that 's where those big peaks are over to the left .
and just for contrast , we can do this with any word .
`` we can take the word `` '' bye '' '' as in `` '' good bye . '' '' and we 're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house . ''
`` and we look , and we find , as you would expect , a contrast in the landscape where the word `` '' bye '' '' occurs much more in a structured way . ''
so we 're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition , and that 's ongoing work now .
in my lab , which we 're peering into now , at mit — this is at the media lab .
this has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space .
three of the key people in this project , philip decamp , rony kubat and brandon roy are pictured here .
philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you 're seeing .
`` and michael fleischman was another ph.d. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that `` '' just the way that we 're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . '' '' and so our effort took an unexpected turn . ''
think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place .
we 've started analyzing television content using the same principles — analyzing event structure of a tv signal — episodes of shows , commercials , all of the components that make up the event structure .
and we 're now , with satellite dishes , pulling and analyzing a good part of all the tv being watched in the united states .
and you do n't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people 's conversations , you just tune into publicly available social media feeds .
so we 're pulling in about three billion comments a month , and then the magic happens .
you have the event structure , the common ground that the words are about , coming out of the television feeds ; you 've got the conversations that are about those topics ; and through semantic analysis — and this is actually real data you 're looking at from our data processing — each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal .
and the same idea now can be built up .
and we get this wordscape , except now words are not assembled in my living room .
instead , the context , the common ground activities , are the content on television that 's driving the conversations .
and what we 're seeing here , these skyscrapers now , are commentary that are linked to content on television .
same concept , but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere .
and so fundamentally , rather than , for example , measuring content based on how many people are watching , this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content .
and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family , we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people .
this is a subset of data from our database — just 50,000 out of several million — and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources .
and if you put them on one plain , a second plain is where the content lives .
so we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials , and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph .
and then the important third dimension .
each of the links that you 're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content .
and we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways .
so if we , for example , trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it , and then we follow where that comment goes , and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content , a very interesting structure becomes visible .
we call this a co-viewing clique , a virtual living room if you will .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
it 's not one way .
a piece of content , an event , causes someone to talk .
they talk to other people .
that drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
another example — very different — another actual person in our database — and we 're finding at least hundreds , if not thousands , of these .
we 've given this person a name .
this is a pro-amateur , or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate .
so a lot of people are following this person — very influential — and they have a propensity to talk about what 's on tv .
so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .
one last example from this data : sometimes it 's actually a piece of content that is special .
so if we go and look at this piece of content , president obama 's state of the union address from just a few weeks ago , and look at what we find in this same data set , at the same scale , the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable .
a nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what 's on the broadcast .
and of course , through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language .
we can x-ray and get a real-time pulse of a nation , real-time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content .
so , to summarize , the idea is this : as our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they 're saying it in , what 's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen .
it 's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication .
and i think the implications here are profound , whether it 's for science , for commerce , for government , or perhaps most of all , for us as individuals .
and so just to return to my son , when i was preparing this talk , he was looking over my shoulder , and i showed him the clips i was going to show to you today , and i asked him for permission — granted .
`` and then i went on to reflect , `` '' is n't it amazing , this entire database , all these recordings , i 'm going to hand off to you and to your sister '' '' — who arrived two years later — `` '' and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? '' '' and he was quiet for a moment . ''
`` and i thought , `` '' what am i thinking ? ''
`` he 's five years old . he 's not going to understand this . '' '' and just as i was having that thought , he looked up at me and said , `` '' so that when i grow up , i can show this to my kids ? '' '' and i thought , `` '' wow , this is powerful stuff . '' '' so i want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family . ''
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once — captured on film .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
it 's a cluttered environment ; it 's natural life .
my mother 's in the kitchen , cooking , and , of all places , in the hallway , i realize he 's about to do it , about to take more than two steps .
and so you hear me encouraging him , realizing what 's happening , and then the magic happens .
listen very carefully .
`` about three steps in , he realizes something magic is happening , and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in , and he takes a breath in , and he whispers `` '' wow '' '' and instinctively i echo back the same . ''
and so let 's fly back in time to that memorable moment .
( video ) dr : hey .
come here .
can you do it ?
oh , boy .
can you do it ?
baby : yeah .
dr : ma , he 's walking .
( laughter ) ( applause ) dr : thank you . ( applause )
the magical moment , the magical moment of conducting .
which is , you go onto a stage . there is an orchestra sitting .
they are all , you know , warming up and doing stuff .
and i go on the podium .
you know , this little office of the conductor .
or rather a cubicle , an open-space cubicle , with a lot of space .
and in front of all that noise , you do a very small gesture .
something like this , not very pomp , not very sophisticated , this .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
noise becomes music .
and this is fantastic . and it 's so tempting to think that it 's all about me .
( laughter ) all those great people here , virtuosos , they make noise , they need me to do that .
not really . if it were that , i would just save you the talk , and teach you the gesture .
so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want , and you have perfect harmony . it does n't work .
let 's look at the first video .
i hope you 'll think it 's a good example of harmony .
and then speak a little bit about how it comes about .
( music ) was that nice ?
so that was a sort of a success .
now , who should we thank for the success ?
i mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the vienna philharmonic orchestra .
they do n't often even look at the conductor .
then you have the clapping audience , yeah , actually taking part in doing the music .
you know viennese audiences usually do n't interfere with the music .
this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in vienna .
( laughter ) unlike , for example israel , where audiences cough all the time .
`` you know , arthur rubinstein , the pianist , used to say that , `` '' anywhere in the world , people that have the flu , they go to the doctor . ''
`` in tel aviv they come to my concerts . '' '' ( laughter ) so that 's a sort of a tradition . ''
but viennese audiences do not do that .
here they go out of their regular , just to be part of that , to become part of the orchestra , and that 's great .
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event .
but what about the conductor ? what can you say the conductor was doing , actually ?
um , he was happy .
and i often show this to senior management .
people get annoyed .
`` `` you come to work . how come you 're so happy ? '' ''
something must be wrong there , yeah ? but he 's spreading happiness .
and i think the happiness , the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music .
the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time .
you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body .
you have the story of the audience as a community . yeah .
you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience .
and then you have other stories , unseen .
people who build this wonderful concert hall .
people who made those stradivarius , amati , all those beautiful instruments .
and all those stories are being heard at the same time .
this is the true experience of a live concert .
that 's a reason to go out of home . yeah ?
and not all conductors do just that .
let 's see somebody else , a great conductor .
riccardo muti , please .
( music ) yeah , that was very short , but you could see it 's a completely different figure . right ?
he 's awesome . he 's so commanding . yeah ?
so clear . maybe a little bit over-clear .
can we have a little demonstration ? would you be my orchestra for a second ?
can you sing , please , the first note of don giovanni ?
`` you have to sing `` '' aaaaaah , '' '' and i 'll stop you . ''
okay ? ready ?
audience : ♫ aaaaaaah ... ♫ itay talgam : come on , with me . if you do it without me i feel even more redundant than i already feel .
so please , wait for the conductor .
`` now look at me . `` `` aaaaaah , '' '' and i stop you . let 's go . ''
audience : ♫ ... aaaaaaaah ... ♫ ( laughter ) itay talgam : so we 'll have a little chat later . ( laughter )
but ... there is a vacancy for a ...
but — ( laughter ) — you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger .
now what does riccardo muti do ? he does something like this ...
( laughter ) and then — sort of — ( laughter ) so not only the instruction is clear , but also the sanction , what will happen if you do n't do what i tell you . ( laughter )
so , does it work ? yes , it works — to a certain point .
`` when muti is asked , `` '' why do you conduct like this ? '' '' he says , `` '' i 'm responsible . '' '' responsible in front of him . ''
no he does n't really mean him . he means mozart , which is — ( laughter ) — like a third seat from the center . ( laughter )
`` so he says , `` '' if i 'm — ( applause ) if i 'm responsible for mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told . ''
`` it 's mozart as i , riccardo muti , understand it . '' '' and you know what happened to muti ? ''
`` three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of la scala , musical employees , i mean the musicians , saying , `` '' you 're a great conductor . we do n't want to work with you . please resign . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' why ? because you do n't let us develop . ''
you 're using us as instruments , not as partners .
`` and our joy of music , etc. , etc . ... '' '' so he had to resign . is n't that nice ? ''
( laughter ) he 's a nice guy . he 's a really nice guy .
well , can you do it with less control , or with a different kind of control ?
let 's look at the next conductor , richard strauss .
( music ) i 'm afraid you 'll get the feeling that i really picked on him because he 's old .
`` it 's not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called `` the ten commandments for conductors . '' ''
the first one was : if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .
that 's the first one . the fourth one you 'll like better .
it says : never look at the trombones — it only encourages them .
( laughter ) so , the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself .
do not interfere .
but how does it happen ? did you see him turning pages in the score ?
now , either he is senile , and does n't remember his own music , because he wrote the music .
`` or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them , saying , `` '' come on guys . you have to play by the book . ''
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
`` it 's only the execution of the written music , no interpretation . '' '' interpretation is the real story of the performer . ''
so , no , he does n't want that . that 's a different kind of control .
let 's see another super-conductor , a german super-conductor . herbert von karajan , please .
( music ) what 's different ? did you see the eyes ? closed .
did you see the hands ?
did you see this kind of movement ? let me conduct you . twice .
once like a muti , and you 'll — ( claps ) — clap , just once .
and then like karajan . let 's see what happens . okay ?
like muti . you ready ? because muti ...
( laughter ) okay ? ready ? let 's do it .
audience : ( claps ) itay talgam : hmm ... again . audience : ( claps )
itay talgam : good . now like a karajan . since you 're already trained , let me concentrate , close my eyes . come , come .
audience : ( claps ) ( laughter ) itay talgam : why not together ? ( laughter ) because you did n't know when to play .
now i can tell you , even the berlin philharmonic does n't know when to play .
( laughter ) but i 'll tell you how they do it . no cynicism .
this is a german orchestra , yes ?
they look at karajan . and then they look at each other .
`` ( laughter ) `` do you understand what this guy wants ? '' ''
and after doing that , they really look at each other , and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together .
`` and when karajan is asked about it he actually says , `` '' yes , the worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction . ''
`` because that would prevent the ensemble , the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra . '' '' now that 's great . what about the eyes ? ''
why are the eyes closed ?
there is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london .
and he cues in a flute player like this .
`` the guy has no idea what to do . ( laughter ) `` maestro , with all due respect , when should i start ? '' ''
what do you think karajan 's reply was ? when should i start ?
`` oh yeah . he says , `` '' you start when you ca n't stand it anymore . '' '' ( laughter ) meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything . ''
it 's my music . the real music is only in karajan 's head .
and you have to guess my mind . so you are under tremendous pressure because i do n't give you instruction , and yet , you have to guess my mind .
so it 's a different kind of , a very spiritual but yet very firm control .
can we do it in another way ? of course we can . let 's go back to the first conductor we 've seen : carlos kleiber , his name . next video , please .
( music ) ( laughter ) yeah .
well , it is different . but is n't that controlling in the same way ?
no , it 's not , because he is not telling them what to do .
`` when he does this , it 's not , `` '' take your stradivarius and like jimi hendrix , smash it on the floor . '' '' it 's not that . ''
`` he says , `` '' this is the gesture of the music . ''
`` i 'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation . '' '' that is another story . ''
but how does it really work together if it does n't give them instructions ?
it 's like being on a rollercoaster . yeah ?
you 're not really given any instructions , but the forces of the process itself keep you in place .
that 's what he does .
the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist .
it 's not a physical thing . it 's in the players ' heads .
and that 's what makes them into partners .
you have the plan in your head .
you know what to do , even though kleiber is not conducting you .
but here and there and that . you know what to do .
and you become a partner building the rollercoaster , yeah , with sound , as you actually take the ride .
this is very exciting for those players .
they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks , later .
( laughter ) it is very tiring . yeah ?
but it 's the best music making , like this .
but of course it 's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy .
you also have to be very professional .
and look again at this kleiber .
can we have the next video , quickly ?
you 'll see what happens when there is a mistake .
( music ) again you see the beautiful body language . ( music )
and now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done .
go along with the video . look .
see , second time for the same player .
( laughter ) and now the third time for the same player . ( laughter )
`` `` '' wait for me after the concert . ''
`` i have a short notice to give you . '' '' you know , when it 's needed , the authority is there . it 's very important . ''
but authority is not enough to make people your partners .
let 's see the next video , please . see what happens here .
you might be surprised having seen kleiber as such a hyperactive guy .
he 's conducting mozart .
( music ) the whole orchestra is playing . ( music )
now something else . ( music )
see ? he is there 100 percent , but not commanding , not telling what to do .
rather enjoying what the soloist is doing .
( music ) another solo now . see what you can pick up from this . ( music )
look at the eyes .
okay . you see that ?
first of all , it 's a kind of a compliment we all like to get .
`` it 's not feedback . it 's an `` '' mmmm ... '' '' yeah , it comes from here . ''
so that 's a good thing .
and the second thing is it 's about actually being in control , but in a very special way .
when kleiber does — did you see the eyes , going from here ? ( singing ) you know what happens ? gravitation is no more .
kleiber not only creates a process , but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place .
so again , the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work , and creative and all of that .
and the level in which kleiber is in control is in a different level .
so control is no longer a zero-sum game .
you have this control . you have this control . and all you put together , in partnership , brings about the best music .
so kleiber is about process .
kleiber is about conditions in the world .
but you need to have process and content to create the meaning .
lenny bernstein , my own personal maestro .
since he was a great teacher , lenny bernstein always started from the meaning . look at this , please .
( music ) do you remember the face of muti , at the beginning ?
well he had a wonderful expression , but only one .
( laughter ) did you see lenny 's face ?
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
and you 're playing a painful sound .
and you look at lenny and he 's suffering .
but not in a way that you want to stop .
it 's suffering , like , enjoying himself in a jewish way , as they say .
( laughter ) but you can see the music on his face .
you can see the baton left his hand . no more baton .
now it 's about you , the player , telling the story .
now it 's a reversed thing . you 're telling the story . and you 're telling the story .
and even briefly , you become the storyteller to which the community , the whole community , listens to .
and bernstein enables that . is n't that wonderful ?
now , if you are doing all the things we talked about , together , and maybe some others , you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing .
and for the last video , i think this is simply the best title .
`` my friend peter says , `` '' if you love something , give it away . '' '' so , please . ''
( music ) ( applause )
when i was only three or four , i fell in love with poetry , with the rhythms and the music of language ; with the power of metaphor and of imagery , poetry being the essence of communication — the discipline , the distillation .
and all these years later , the poems i 'll read today are from my just-finished seventh book of poetry .
well , five years ago , i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease .
though there 's no cure yet , advances in treatment are really impressive .
but you can imagine that i was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials , despite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men — ( laughter ) who happen to have different reproductive systems .
but you bring to a crisis the person you already are , including the , yes , momentum that you 've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action , both of which require but also create energy .
so as an activist , i began working with the parkinson 's disease foundation — that 's pdf.org — to create a major initiative to put women on the parkinson 's disease map .
and as a poet , i began working with this subject matter , finding it tragic , hilarious , sometimes even joyful .
i do not feel diminished by parkinson 's ; i feel distilled by it , and i actually very much like the woman i 'm distilling into .
`` `` no signs of struggle '' growing small requires enormity of will : just sitting still in the doctor 's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out , watching it stoop ; stare at you while you try not to look . ''
rare is an exchange : a smile of brief , wry recognition .
you are the new kid on the block .
everyone here was you once .
you are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you ca n't fit into yet : acceptance of irritating help from those who love you ; giving way and over , but not up .
`` you 've swallowed hard the contents of the `` '' drink me '' '' bottle , and felt yourself shrink . ''
now , familiar furniture looms , floors tilt , and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands .
it demands colossal patience , all this growing small : your diminished sleep at night , your handwriting , your voice , your height .
you are more the incredible shrinking woman than the buddhist mystic , serene , making do with less .
less is not always more .
yet in this emptying space , space glimmers , becoming visible .
here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment .
it is a place of merciless poetry , a gift of presence previously ignored , drowned in the daily clutter .
here every gesture needs intention , is alive with consciousness .
nothing is automatic .
you can spot it in the provocation of a button , an arm poking at a sleeve , a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark .
feats of such modest valor , who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate , fierce discipline , a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware ?
such understated power here , in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant .
such quiet beauty here , in these , my soft-voiced , stiff-limbed people ; such resolve masked by each placid face .
there is immensity required in growing small , so bent on such unbending grace .
( applause ) thank you .
`` this one is called `` '' on donating my brain to science . '' '' ( laughter ) not a problem . ''
skip over all the pages reassuring religious people .
already a universal donor : kidneys , corneas , liver , lungs , tissue , heart , veins , whatever .
odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research , maybe saving someone else from what it is they 're not quite sure i have .
flattering , that .
so fill in the forms , drill through the answers , trill out a blithe spirit .
and slice me , dice me , spread me on your slides .
find what i 'm trying to tell you .
earn me , learn me , scan me , squint through your lens .
uncover what i 'd hint at if i could .
be my guest , do your best , harvest me , track the clues .
this was a good brain while alive .
this was a brain that paid its dues .
so slice me , dice me , smear me on your slides , stain me , explain me , drain me like a cup .
share me , hear me : i want to be used i want to be used i want to be used up .
some life forms — certain mushrooms , snails , jellyfish , worms — glow bioluminescent , and people as well ; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves .
our tragedy is we ca n't see it .
we see by reflecting .
we need biofluorescence to show our true colors .
external illumination can distort , though .
when gravity bends light , huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes , elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs — a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine .
a glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard 's part ; as if , besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic turner canvasses spied out by the hubble , i could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare .
stare as long as you need to .
if you think about it , walking , even standing , is illogical — such tiny things , feet ! — ( laughter ) especially when one 's body is not al dente anymore . ( laughter )
besides , creature of extremes and excess , i 've always thought apollo beautiful but boring , and a bit of a dumb blonde .
dionysians do n't do balance .
balance , in other words , has never been my strong point .
but i digress .
more and more these days , digression seems the most direct route through from where i 've lost or found myself out of place , mind , turn , time .
place your foot just so , mind how you turn : too swift a swivel can bring you down .
take your time ushering the audience out , saying goodbye to the actors .
the ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater .
( applause ) and this is the last one .
`` `` this dark hour '' late summer , 4 a.m . ''
the rain slows to a stop , dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's dark .
barefoot , careful on the slick slate slabs , i need no light , i know the way , stoop by the mint bed , scoop a fistful of moist earth , then grope for a chair , spread a shawl , and sit , breathing in the wet green august air .
this is the small , still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade , the phone shrills , the computer screen blinks and glares awake .
there is this hour : poem in my head , soil in my hand : unnamable fullness .
this hour , when blood of my blood bone of bone , child grown to manhood now — stranger , intimate , not distant but apart — lies safe , off dreaming melodies while love sleeps , safe , in his arms .
to have come to this place , lived to this moment : immeasurable lightness .
the density of black starts to blur umber .
tentative , a cardinal 's coloratura , then the mourning dove 's elegy .
sable glimmers toward grey ; objects emerge , trailing shadows ; night ages toward day .
the city stirs .
there will be other dawns , nights , gaudy noons .
likely , i 'll lose my way .
there will be stumbling , falling , cursing the dark .
whatever comes , there was this hour when nothing mattered , all was unbearably dear .
and when i 'm done with daylights , should those who loved me grieve too long a while , let them remember that i had this hour — this dark , perfect hour — and smile .
thank you .
( applause )
fifteen years ago , it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life .
back then , 15 years ago , we did n't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological , hormonal , physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable , independent role in society .
( laughter ) it can go on a long time . ( laughter ) one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex .
so this is a model of the human brain , and this is prefrontal cortex , right at the front .
prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area .
so mri studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it peaks in early adolescence .
the arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex . you can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls , and that 's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average , and then during adolescence , there 's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex .
this is a really important process . it 's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in , and the synapses that are being used are strengthened , and synapses that are n't being used in that particular environment are pruned away .
you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush .
you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining , important branches , can grow stronger , and this process , which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue according to the species-specific environment , is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence .
so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional mri to look at changes in brain activity across age .
so in my lab , we 're interested in the social brain , that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people .
so i like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work .
and i think they 're on the wrong end of the stadium , and they 're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize , and that 's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates , how good we are at reading other people 's behavior , their actions , their gestures , their facial expressions , in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states .
so you do n't have to ask any of these guys .
you have a pretty good idea of what they 're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time .
so in my lab , we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan , we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people , their minds , their mental states , their emotions , and one of the findings that we 've found several times now , as have other labs around the world , is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex , which is shown in blue on the slide , and it 's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head .
and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach , a different cognitive strategy , to make social decisions , and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task , and i 'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab .
so imagine that you 're the participant in one of our experiments . you come into the lab , you see this computerized task .
in this task , you see a set of shelves .
now , there are objects on these shelves , on some of them , and you 'll notice there 's a guy standing behind the set of shelves , and there are some objects that he ca n't see .
they 're occluded , from his point of view , with a kind of gray piece of wood .
this is the same set of shelves from his point of view .
notice that there are only some objects that he can see , whereas there are many more objects that you can see .
now your task is to move objects around .
they move the white truck instead of the blue truck .
we tell them , okay , we 're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there 's no director . instead you 've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background .
but it 's when you compare the last two groups , the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting , because there , there is no continued improvement in the no-director condition .
so we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
they 're parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they 're sometimes moody , they 're very self-conscious .
( laughter ) the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave .
`` so people often ask , `` '' well , is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon ? ''
`` is it something we 've invented recently in the west ? '' '' and actually , the answer is probably not . there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today . ''
`` so there 's a famous quote by shakespeare from `` '' the winter 's tale '' '' where he describes adolescence as follows : `` '' i would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting . '' '' ( laughter ) he then goes on to say , `` '' having said that , would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt in this weather ? '' '' ( laughter ) so almost 400 years ago , shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today , but today we try to understand ''
so for example , take risk-taking . we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . they do .
they take more risks than children or adults , and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they 're with their friends . there 's an important drive to become independent from one 's parents and to impress one 's friends in adolescence .
so the limbic system is right deep inside the brain , and it 's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing . it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things , including taking risks .
it gives you the kick out of taking risks .
and this region , the regions within the limbic system , have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults , and at the very same time , the prefrontal cortex , which you can see in blue in the slide here , which stops us taking excessive risks , is still very much in development in adolescents .
so brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development , and this has implications for education , for rehabilitation , and intervention . the environment , including teaching , can and does shape the developing adolescent brain , and yet it 's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west .
all four of my grandparents , for example , left school in their early adolescence . they had no choice .
and that 's still the case for many , many teenagers around the world today . forty percent of teenagers do n't have access to secondary school education .
and yet , this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable .
it 's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity .
so what 's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescents — heightened risk-taking , poor impulse control , self-consciousness — should n't be stigmatized .
it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
`` two weeks ago i was in my studio in paris , and the phone rang and i heard , `` '' hey , jr , you won the ted prize 2011 . ''
`` you have to make a wish to save the world . '' '' i was lost . ''
i mean , i ca n't save the world . nobody can .
the world is fucked up .
come on , you have dictators ruling the world , population is growing by millions , there 's no more fish in the sea , the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said , we 're all becoming fat .
( laughter ) except maybe french people .
whatever .
`` so i called back and i told her , `` '' look , amy , tell the ted guys i just wo n't show up . ''
`` i ca n't do anything to save the world . '' '' she said , `` '' hey , jr , your wish is not to save the world , but to change the world . '' '' `` oh , all right . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` that 's cool . '' ''
i mean , technology , politics , business do change the world — not always in a good way , but they do .
what about art ?
could art change the world ?
i started when i was 15 years old .
and at that time , i was not thinking about changing the world .
i was doing graffiti — writing my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
i was going in the tunnels of paris , on the rooftops with my friends .
each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
`` it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , `` '' i was here , '' '' on the top of a building . ''
so when i found a cheap camera on the subway , i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies — really small photos just that size .
that 's how , at 17 years old , i started pasting them .
`` and i did my first `` '' expo de rue , '' '' which means sidewalk gallery . ''
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
i mean , the city 's the best gallery i could imagine .
i would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people .
i would control it directly with the public in the streets .
so that 's paris .
i would change — depending on the places i would go — the title of the exhibition .
that 's on the champs-elysees .
i was quite proud of that one .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
( laughter ) november 2005 : the streets are burning .
a large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of paris .
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
i mean , these kids , without control , throwing molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops .
these were criminals , thugs , dangerous , destroying their own environment .
and then i saw it — could it be possible ? — my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car — a pasting i 'd done a year earlier — an illegal one — still there .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
i know those guys .
all of them are not angels , but they 're not monsters either .
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
it was the only one i had at that time .
but with that lens , you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person .
so you can do it only with their trust .
so i took full portraits of people from le bosquet .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
a year later , the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris .
and we go from thug images , who 've been stolen and distorted by the media , who 's now proudly taking over his own image .
that 's where i realized the power of paper and glue .
so could art change the world ?
a year later , i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict .
i mean , at that time , trust me , they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict .
so with my friend marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .
are they so different ?
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs — taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
not a smile — that really does n't tell about who you are and what you feel .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall .
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
we called the project face 2 face .
`` the experts said , `` '' no way . ''
the people will not accept .
`` the army will shoot you , and hamas will kidnap you . '' '' we said , `` '' okay , let 's try and push as far as we can . '' '' i love the way that people will ask me , `` how big will my photo be ? '' ''
`` `` it will be as big as your house . '' ''
when we did the wall , we did the palestinian side .
so we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough .
`` and so palestinians guys say , `` calm down . no wait . i 'm going to find you a solution . '' ''
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
( laughter ) we did face 2 face with only six friends , two ladders , two brushes , a rented car , a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper .
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
okay , for example , that 's palestine .
we 're in ramallah right now .
we 're pasting portraits — so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
`` people come around us and start asking , `` what are you doing here ? '' ''
`` `` '' oh , we 're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job . ''
`` and those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . '' '' and then there was always a silence . ''
`` `` '' you mean you 're pasting an israeli face — doing a face — right here ? '' '' `` well , yeah , yeah , that 's part of the project . '' ''
`` and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , `` so can you tell me who is who ? '' ''
and most of them could n't say .
( applause ) we even pasted on israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
when you paste an image , it 's just paper and glue .
people can tear it , tag on it , or even pee on it — some are a bit high for that , i agree — but the people in the street , they are the curator .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
they are not meant to stay .
but exactly four years after , the photos , most of them are still there .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and , you know what , even easy .
we did n't push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
in the middle east , i experienced my work in places without [ many ] museums .
so the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums .
when you go in these developing societies , women are the pillars of their community , but the men are still the ones holding the streets .
so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos .
i called that project women are heroes .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i could n't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
i just observed .
sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
i just took their pictures and pasted them .
women are heroes took me around the world .
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i 've heard about it through the media .
so for example , in june 2008 , i was watching tv in paris , and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de janeiro — the first favela of brazil named providencia .
three kids — that was three students — were [ detained ] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
and the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces .
i was shocked .
all brazil was shocked .
i heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
so i decided to go there .
when i arrived — i mean , i did n't have any contact with any ngo .
there was none in place — no association , no ngos , nothing — no eyewitnesses .
so we just walked around , and we met a woman , and i showed her my book .
`` and she said , `` '' you know what ? ''
we 're hungry for culture .
`` we need culture out there . '' '' so i went out and i started with the kids . ''
i just took a few photos of the kids , and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them .
the day after , i came back and they were already scratched .
but that 's okay .
i wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
they were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
there was the mother , the grandmother , the best friend — they all wanted to shout the story .
after that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
`` the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place , so i told them , `` '' you know what ? ''
i 'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
you see that enough in the media .
what i want to show is the incredible life and energy .
`` i 've been seeing it around me the last few days . '' '' so that 's a really symbolic pasting , because that 's the first one we did that you could n't see from the city . ''
and that 's where the three kids got arrested , and that 's the grandmother of one of them .
and on that stairs , that 's where the traffickers always stand and there 's a lot of exchange of fire .
everyone there understood the project .
and then we pasted everywhere — the whole hill .
( applause ) what was interesting is that the media could n't get in .
i mean , you should see that .
they would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens , and we would see ourselves , on tv , pasting .
`` and they would put a number : `` '' please call this number if you know what 's going on in providencia . '' '' we just did a project and then left so the media would n't know . ''
so how can we know about the project ?
so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them .
so you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women .
we kept traveling .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
in war-torn places like monrovia , people come straight to you .
i mean , they want to know what you 're up to .
`` they kept asking me , `` '' what is the purpose of your project ? ''
`` are you an ngo ? are you the media ? '' '' art . just doing art . ''
`` some people question , `` '' why is it in black and white ? ''
`` do n't you have color in france ? '' '' ( laughter ) or they tell you , `` '' are these people all dead ? '' '' some who understood the project would explain it to others . ''
`` and to a man who did not understand , i heard someone say , `` '' you know , you 've been here for a few hours trying to understand , discussing with your fellows . ''
during that time , you have n't thought about what you 're going to eat tomorrow .
`` this is art . '' '' i think it 's people 's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects . ''
and then it becomes more .
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
on this bridge that 's in monrovia , ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war .
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
this is kibera , kenya , one of the largest slums of africa .
you might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008 .
this time we covered the roofs of the houses , but we did n't use paper , because paper does n't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house — vinyl does .
then art becomes useful .
so the people kept it .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so [ many ] houses inside .
and i went there a few months ago — photos are still there — and it was missing a piece of the eye .
so i asked the people what happened .
`` `` oh , that guy just moved . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) when the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , `` now god can see me . '' ''
when you look at kibera now , they look back .
okay , india .
before i start that , just so you know , each time we go to a place , we do n't have authorization , so we set up like commandos — we 're a group of friends who arrive there , and we try to paste on the walls .
but there are places where you just ca n't paste on a wall .
in india it was just impossible to paste .
i heard culturally and because of the law , they would just arrest us at the first pasting .
so we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
so imagine white guys pasting white papers .
`` so people would come to us and ask us , `` hey , what are you up to ? '' ''
`` `` oh , you know , we 're just doing art . '' `` art ? '' ''
of course , they were confused .
but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets , and the more dust you would have going up in the air , on the white paper you can almost see , but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker .
so the more dust you have , the more it will reveal the photo .
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .
( applause ) thank you .
so we did n't get caught this time .
each project — that 's a film from women are heroes .
( music ) okay .
for each project we do a film .
`` and most of what you see — that 's a trailer from `` '' women are heroes '' '' — its images , photography , taken one after the other . ''
and the photos kept traveling even without us .
( laughter ) ( applause ) hopefully , you 'll see the film , and you 'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .
because that 's a big part of it . there 's layers behind each photo .
behind each image is a story .
women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities , and the women kept that dynamic after we left .
for example , we did books — not for sale — that all the community would get .
but to get it , they would have to [ get ] it signed by one of the women .
we did that in most of the places .
we go back regularly .
and so in providencia , for example , in the favela , we have a cultural center running there .
in kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
`` because of course , when we left , the people who were just at the edge of the project said , `` '' hey , what about my roof ? '' '' so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project . ''
a really important point for me is that i do n't use any brand or corporate sponsors .
so i have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects .
( applause ) and that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
i think , today , as important as the result is the way you do things .
and that has always been a central part of the work .
and what 's interesting is that fine line that i have with images and advertising .
we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
and i was even invited to cover the moca museum .
`` but yesterday the city called them and said , `` '' look , you 're going to have to tear it down . ''
`` because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down . '' '' but tell me , advertising for what ? ''
the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .
but they asked me for a promise basically .
`` they asked me , `` '' please , make our story travel with you . '' '' so i did . that 's paris . ''
that 's rio .
in each place , we built exhibitions with a story , and the story traveled .
you understand the full scope of the project .
that 's london .
new york .
and today , they are with you in long beach .
all right , recently i started a public art project where i do n't use my artwork anymore .
i use man ray , helen levitt , giacomelli , other people 's artwork .
it does n't matter today if it 's your photo or not .
the importance is what you do with the images , the statement it makes where it 's pasted .
so for example , i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country .
( applause ) this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally , and i pasted it in southern italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
in some ways , art can change the world .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
art can change the way we see the world .
art can create an analogy .
actually the fact that art can not change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world .
when i do my work , i have two kinds of reactions .
`` people say , `` '' oh , why do n't you go in iraq or afghanistan . ''
`` they would be really useful . '' '' or , `` '' how can we help ? '' '' i presume that you belong to the second category , and that 's good , because for that project , i 'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them . ''
so now my wish is : ( mock drum roll ) ( laughter ) i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we 'll turn the world inside out .
and this starts right now .
yes , everyone in the room .
everyone watching .
i wanted that wish to actually start now .
so a subject you 're passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos — tell me what you stand for .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it — i 'll give you all the details — and i 'll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
the full data is on the website — insideoutproject.net — that is launching today .
what we see changes who we are .
when we act together , the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts .
so i hope that , together , we 'll create something that the world will remember .
and this starts right now and depends on you .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
well , we all need a reason to wake up .
for me , it just took 11,000 volts .
it was just sitting there , with the wires that run overhead .
we 'd certainly done stupider things .
would you believe that watch still works ?
takes a licking !
that night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient .
so i guess we 're all patients .
why ?
which is to say , of course , it was badly designed .
there are no do-overs .
so let 's begin at the end .
it 's a key distinction .
it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves .
it took me a while , but i learned it eventually .
this , we are finally realizing , is where healing happens .
it serves no good purpose .
how we die is indeed something we can affect .
it 's simply about comfort and living well at any stage .
now , let me introduce you to frank .
sort of makes this point .
in this way , frank grieves .
loss is one thing , but regret , quite another .
was this a good idea ?
with all the risks to his safety and his health , some would say no .
so much of what we 're talking about today is a shift in perspective .
i revere hospitals for what they can do ; i am alive because of them .
but we ask too much of our hospitals .
they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness .
beauty can be found anywhere .
and one night , it began to snow outside .
i remember my nurses complaining about driving through it .
next day , one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me .
in a hospital , that 's a stolen moment .
and we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami .
now is the time to create something new , something vital .
we have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with .
little things are n't so little .
take janette .
priorities change .
beneficence .
`` `` '' play '' '' may sound like a funny word here . ''
but it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation .
the need for food has birthed cuisine .
we ca n't solve for death .
i know some of you are working on this .
thank you .
in india , we have these huge families .
i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it .
which means that there are a lot of family events .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins .
and there was always this one uncle who used to be there , always ready , jumping around with us , having games for us , making us kids have the time of our lives .
this man was extremely successful : he was confident and powerful .
but then i saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health .
he was diagnosed with parkinson 's .
parkinson 's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system , which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee , because of tremors , much more difficult .
my uncle started using a walker to walk , and to take a turn , he literally had to take one step at a time , like this , and it took forever .
so this person , who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering , was suddenly hiding behind people .
he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes .
and he 's not the only one in the world .
every year , 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with parkinson 's , and this number is only rising .
as designers , we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems , one solution that solves it all , but it need not always be like that .
you can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact .
so my aim here was to not cure parkinson 's , but to make their everyday tasks much more simple , and then make an impact .
well , the first thing i targeted was tremors , right ?
my uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment , so , well , i designed the no-spill cup .
it works just purely on its form .
the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors , and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup .
but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product .
it looks like a cup that could be used by you , me , any clumsy person , and that makes it much more comforting for them to use , to blend in .
so , well , one problem solved , many more to go .
all this while , i was interviewing him , questioning him , and then i realized that i was getting very superficial information , or just answers to my questions .
but i really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective .
so i thought , well , let 's observe him in his daily tasks , while he 's eating , while he 's watching tv .
and then , when i was actually observing him walking to his dining table , it struck me , this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land , how does he climb a staircase ?
because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries .
one actually has to climb the stairs .
`` so he told me , `` well , let me show you how i do it . '' ''
let 's take a look at what i saw .
`` so he took really long to reach this position , and then all this while , i 'm thinking , `` '' oh my god , is he really going to do it ? ''
`` is he really , really going to do it without his walker ? '' '' and then ... ''
( laughter ) and the turns , he took them so easily .
so — shocked ?
well , i was too .
so this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs .
on researching this , i realized that it 's because it 's a continuous motion .
there 's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker , but the moment he 's put on a cycle , all his symptoms vanish , because it is a continuous motion .
so the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land .
and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him , but the one that finally worked was this one . let 's take a look .
( laughter ) ( applause ) he walked faster , right ? ( applause )
i call this the staircase illusion , and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended , he froze , and this is called freezing of gait .
so it happens a lot , so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms , making them feel much more confident ?
you know , technology is not always it .
what we need are human-centered solutions .
i could have easily made it into a projection , or a google glass , or something like that .
but i stuck to simple print on the floor .
this print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome .
what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day .
he told me that i made him feel like his old self again .
`` `` '' smart '' '' in today 's world has become synonymous to high tech , and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day . ''
but why ca n't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective ?
all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity , to go out there , observe .
but let 's not stop at that .
let 's find these complex problems . do n't be scared of them .
break them , boil them down into much smaller problems , and then find simple solutions for them .
test these solutions , fail if needed , but with newer insights to make it better .
imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions .
what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions ?
let 's make a smarter world , but with simplicity .
thank you .
( applause )
i 'm going to talk about consciousness .
why consciousness ?
well , it 's a curiously neglected subject , both in our scientific and our philosophical culture .
now why is that curious ?
so consciousness is number one .
when i first got interested in this , i thought , well , it 's a straightforward problem in biology .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
well , i think it 's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they 're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions .
one feature is the tradition of religious dualism : consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
it 's a part of the spiritual world .
it belongs to the soul , and the soul is not a part of the physical world .
that 's the tradition of god , the soul and immortality .
that tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists : consciousness is not a part of the physical world .
either it does n't exist at all , or it 's something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it 's not part of science .
and i used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache .
okay , so these twin traditions are paralyzing us .
it 's very hard to get out of these twin traditions .
it 's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was , but i 'll get back to that .
and four : maybe consciousness exists , but it ca n't make any difference to the world .
how could spirituality move anything ?
now , whenever somebody tells me that , i think , you want to see spirituality move something ?
`` watch . i decide consciously to raise my arm , and the damn thing goes up . ( laughter ) furthermore , notice this : we do not say , `` '' well , it 's a bit like the weather in geneva . ''
`` some days it goes up and some days it does n't go up . '' '' no . it goes up whenever i damn well want it to . ''
okay . i 'm going to tell you how that 's possible .
now , i have n't yet given you a definition .
you ca n't do this if you do n't give a definition .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness .
it begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep , and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious .
dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
now , that 's the common-sense definition . that 's our target .
if you 're not talking about that , you 're not talking about consciousness .
`` but they think , `` '' well , if that 's it , that 's an awful problem . ''
`` how can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? '' '' and this , if you 've ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem . ''
i think that has a simple solution too . i 'm going to give it to you .
it 's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water .
it 's a condition that the system is in .
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
the famous mind-body problem is that simple .
all right ? but now we get into some harder questions .
you ca n't get rid of it .
it consciously seems to us , but that 's not really happening .
but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are , you ca n't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness , because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned , if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious , you are conscious .
you can not doubt the existence of your own consciousness .
okay , that 's the first feature of consciousness .
it 's real and irreducible .
you can not get rid of it by showing that it 's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions .
there 's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
and we have not been able to do that in a robot .
the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we do n't know how to make a conscious robot , so we do n't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
okay , the next feature of consciousness , after this marvelous unified conscious field , is that it functions causally in our behavior .
i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
how can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects ?
well , i 'll tell you the answer .
sorry to use philosophical terminology here , but when it 's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons , a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up .
now , think of what i told you .
one and the same event , my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy-feely spiritual qualities .
it 's a thought in my brain , but at the same time , it 's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm .
now , what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete .
one and the same event has a level of description where it 's neurobiological , and another level of description where it 's mental , and that 's a single event , and that 's how nature works . that 's how it 's possible for consciousness to function causally .
okay , now with that in mind , with going through these various features of consciousness , let 's go back and answer some of those early objections .
i do n't think we need to worry about that .
it 's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that 's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
i mean , anybody who 's thought about computers at all can see that that 's wrong , because computation is defined as symbol manipulation , usually thought of as zeros as ones , but any symbols will do .
you get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code , and that 's the defining trait of the computer program .
but we know that that 's purely syntactical . that 's symbolic .
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
it 's got a content in addition to the syntax .
it 's got a semantics .
it creates a reality of money , property , government , marriage , cern conferences , cocktail parties and summer vacations , and all of those are creations of consciousness .
their existence is observer-relative .
is that absolute , like force and mass and gravitational attraction ?
or is it observer-relative ?
well , some computations are intrinsic .
i add two plus two to get four .
that 's going on no matter what anybody thinks .
but when i haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation , the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior .
that 's the only absolute phenomenon .
all the rest is interpreted by us .
computation only exists relative to consciousness .
either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he 's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
now that does n't mean computation is arbitrary .
i spent a lot of money on this hardware .
but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
so the objection that you ca n't have an objective science of consciousness because it 's subjective and science is objective , that 's a pun .
your mental states are identical with your behavior ?
well , think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior .
you 're giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
and the message i want to leave you with is , consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon , as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology , or , for that matter , the rest of science .
thank you very much .

driving ourselves .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral .
invest sustainably .
you may never have heard of kenema , sierra leone or arua , nigeria .
but i know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth .
lassa virus is a lot like ebola .
it can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal .
but these individuals , they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities , and by doing so , protect us all .
but one of the most extraordinary things i learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning — these challenging , extraordinary days on the front lines — by singing .
they gather together , and they show their joy .
they show their spirit .
and over the years , from year after year as i 've visited them and they 've visited me , i get to gather with them and i sing and we write and we love it , because it reminds us that we 're not just there to pursue science together ; we 're bonded through a shared humanity .
and that of course , as you can imagine , becomes extremely important , even essential , as things begin to change .
and that changed a great deal in march of 2014 , when the ebola outbreak was declared in guinea .
this is the first outbreak in west africa , near the border of sierra leone and liberia .
and it was frightening , frightening for us all .
we 'd already set up this kind of capacity for lassa virus , we knew how to do it , the team is outstanding .
we just had to give them the tools and place to survey for ebola .
and unfortunately , that day came .
on may 23 , 2014 , a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital , and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of ebola in sierra leone .
this was an exceptional work that was done .
they were able to diagnose the case immediately , to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on .
it could 've stopped something .
but by the time that day came , the outbreak had already been breeding for months .
with hundreds of cases , it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks .
and it came into sierra leone not as that singular case , but as a tidal wave .
and we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could , trying to help the individuals , trying to get attention , but we also did one other simple thing .
from that specimen that we take from a patient 's blood to detect ebola , we can discard it , obviously .
the other thing we can do is , actually , put in a chemical and deactivate it , so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean , and that 's what we did .
we sent it to boston , where my team works .
and we also worked around the clock doing shift work , day after day , and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the ebola virus .
this is the blueprint — the genome of a virus is the blueprint .
we all have one .
it says everything that makes up us , and it tells us so much information .
the results of this kind of work are simple and they 're powerful .
now , that 's incredibly important when you 're trying to figure out how to intervene , but the important thing is contact tracing .
we also could see that as the virus was moving between humans , it was mutating .
and each of those mutations are so important , because the diagnostics , the vaccines , the therapies that we 're using , are all based on that genome sequence , fundamentally — that 's what drives it .
and so global health experts would need to respond , would have to develop , to recalibrate everything that they were doing .
that 's the way the status quo works .
well , that was not going to work at this point , right ?
we had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help , lots of help .
we were working together in this virtual way , sharing , regular calls , communications , trying to follow the virus minute by minute , to see ways that we could stop it .
and there are so many ways that we can form communities like that .
everybody , particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally , was reaching out to learn , to participate , to engage .
everybody wants to play a part .
`` and could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other , that we all just said , `` '' let 's do this . ''
`` let 's work together , and let 's make this happen . '' '' but the problem is that the data that all of us are using , googling on the web , is just too limited to do what we need to do . ''
so in the early part of the epidemic from kenema , we 'd had 106 clinical records from patients , and we once again made that publicly available to the world .
but 106 is just not enough to make it powerful , to validate it .
and the data has still not come .
we are still waiting , tweaking away , in silos rather than working together .
and this just — we ca n't accept that .
right ? you , all of you , can not accept that .
it 's our lives on the line .
these are just five of many health-care workers at kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked , quietly and separately .
when we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves , the virus thrives .
we 're all in this fight together .
ebola on one person 's doorstep could soon be on ours .
and so in this place with the same vulnerabilities , the same strengths , the same fears , the same hopes , i hope that we work together with joy .
`` a graduate student of mine was reading a book about sierra leone , and she discovered that the word `` '' kenema , '' '' the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in sierra leone , is named after the mende word for `` '' clear like a river , translucent and open to the public gaze . '' '' that was really profound for us , because without knowing it , we 'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in kenema where we worked , we had to work openly , we had to share and we had to work together . ''
and we have to do that .
we all have to demand that of ourselves and others — to be open to each other when an outbreak happens , to fight in this fight together .
because this is not the first outbreak of ebola , it will not be the last , and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait , like lassa virus and others .
and the next time this happens , it could happen in a city of millions , it could start there .
it could be something that 's transmitted through the air .
it could even be disseminated intentionally .
and i know that that is frightening , i understand that , but i know also , and this experience shows us , that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing , to win this and have the upper hand over viruses .
but we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy .
so for dr. khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always , let us be in this fight with them always .
and let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus , but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity .
thank you .
( applause )
do you need new glasses ?
are you losing your mind ?
you run through a quick mental checklist .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
so i was the first subject .
so that 's pretty cool , but how do we know this is n't a fluke ?
well , the easiest way is to just do the experiment again .
so i got back in the scanner , i looked at more faces and i looked at more objects and i got a similar blob , and then i did it again and i did it again and again and again , and around about then i decided to believe it was for real .
so with the patient 's consent , the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain .
look at my face .
you almost looked like somebody i 'd seen before , but somebody different .
next , i 'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found .
next , let 's find that face area i 've been talking about that responds to images like these .
yes , we do . so if we turn the brain around a little bit , here 's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago , and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch , like these .
okay , now let 's look at these same regions .
yes , we do .
so here in pink are my language regions .
so it 's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language , but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively .
they respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence , but not when you do other complex mental things , like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music .
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
so that may seem crazy , but actually , we humans do this all the time .
and further , he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects .
and his region responded the same to both sets of images .
i mean , it could have been otherwise .
instead , what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind .
it 's early days in this enterprise .
we 've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind .
so for example , what does each of these regions do exactly ?
second , how are all these things connected in the brain ?
that 's a hugely important goal , and i 'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it , but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that 's worth doing .
the effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease .
this is , i think , the greatest scientific quest of all time .
( applause )
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
but since then , much progress has been made , both in our lab and other labs around the world .
`` and given this , we started getting questions like , `` '' if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and leather ? '' '' when someone first suggested this to me , quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy , but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all . ''
what 's crazy is what we do today .
i 'm convinced that in 30 years , when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags , we 'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy .
did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , dairy , eggs and leather goods ?
and over the next few decades , as the world 's population expands to 10 billion , this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals .
but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet .
animals are not just raw materials .
they 're living beings , and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land , fresh water , and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change .
on top of this , when you get so many animals so close together , it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse .
clearly , we can not continue on this path which puts the environment , public health , and food security at risk .
there is another way , because essentially , animal products are just collections of tissues , and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues .
what if , instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal , we started with what the tissues are made of , the basic unit of life , the cell ?
this is biofabrication , where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs .
already in medicine , biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts , like ears , windpipes , skin , blood vessels and bone , that have been successfully implanted into patients .
and beyond medicine , biofabrication can be a humane , sustainable and scalable new industry .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
i emphasize leather because it is so widely used .
it is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat .
it mainly uses one cell type , and it is largely two-dimensional .
it is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators .
until biofabrication is better understood , it is clear that , initially at least , more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods , no matter how delicious .
in this sense , leather is a gateway material , a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry .
if we can succeed here , it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon .
now how do we do it ?
to grow leather , we begin by taking cells from an animal , through a simple biopsy .
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
this process does no harm , and daisy the cow can live a happy life .
we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium .
this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
and we then coax these cells to produce collagen , as they would naturally .
this collagen is the stuff between cells .
it 's natural connective tissue .
it 's the extracellular matrix , but in leather , it 's the main building block .
and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets , and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another , like phyllo pastry , to form thicker sheets , which we then let mature .
and finally , we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process , we create leather .
and so i 'm very excited to show you , for the first time , the first batch of our cultured leather , fresh from the lab .
this is real , genuine leather , without the animal sacrifice .
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to remove , no scars or insect 's bites , and no waste .
this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet , a handbag or a car seat .
it is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator .
and because we make this material , we grow this leather from the ground up , we can control its properties in very interesting ways .
this piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick , and as you can see , it is nearly transparent .
and this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque .
you do n't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
and we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities , like softness , breathability , durability , elasticity and even things like pattern .
we can mimic nature , but in some ways also improve upon it .
this type of leather can do what today 's leather does , but with imagination , probably much more .
what could the future of animal products look like ?
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
rather , it could be much more like this .
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
and speaking of food , our cultured food has evolved , and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful , sterile facilities like this .
a brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
it is where cell culture takes place .
imagine that in this facility , instead of brewing beer , we were brewing leather or meat .
imagine touring this facility , learning about how the leather or meat is cultured , seeing the process from beginning to end , and even trying some .
it 's clean , open and educational , and this is in contrast to the hidden , guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today .
perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind .
it 's environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
it allows us to be creative .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved .
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
thank you .
( applause )
i 'm a garbage man .
and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man , because i absolutely hate waste .
i hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
and i 'd like to start at the very beginning .
think back when you were just a kid .
how did look at the stuff in your life ?
perhaps it was like these toddler rules : it 's my stuff if i saw it first .
the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something .
the more stuff that 's mine , the better .
and of course , it 's your stuff if it 's broken .
( laughter ) well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it 's become pretty clear to me that we do n't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
and let me tell you why i have that perspective .
because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff .
now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world — well less than one percent .
in fact , the united nations estimates that there 's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year — and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
and of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage .
we see above-ground mines .
and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
and it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
because as we 've heard all week at ted , the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
and of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
it 's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
and the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
and the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today .
the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
most of what 's extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
to put that in perspective — and i 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it 's the most common metal — if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
in fact , it 's more like five percent .
most of it 's incinerated or landfilled .
now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw-away material , have very little value .
but actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
well it 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .
they have very different densities .
they have different electrical and magnetic properties .
and they even have different colors .
so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
and any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know .
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply do n't work for plastics .
another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world — and sadly to say , particularly from the united states , where we do n't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe — finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling .
people , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
they extract what they can , which is mostly the metals — circuit boards and so forth — and they leave behind mostly what they ca n't recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
and they extract the metals by hand .
now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution , this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution .
i call this environmental arbitrage .
and it 's not fair , it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable .
now because the plastics are so plentiful — and by the way , those other methods do n't lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously — but people do try to recover the plastics .
this is just one example .
this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai , india .
they store the plastics on the roofs .
they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can .
`` and sometimes they 'll resort to what 's known as the `` '' burn and sniff '' '' technique where they 'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic . ''
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
and by the way , please do n't try this technique at home .
so what are we to do about this space-age material , at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ?
well i certainly believe that it 's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke .
so about 20 years ago , i literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
because after all , we 're doing above-ground mining .
and we eventually broke the code .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
it 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth .
and we finally figured out how to do it .
and in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics .
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
you breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
we said , there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
well a good place to start is with waste .
it certainly does n't cost as much as oil , and it 's plentiful , as i hope that you 've been able to see from the photographs .
and because we 're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we 're using a mining approach to extract the materials .
we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
we have enormous energy savings .
i do n't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
and we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that 's made from petrochemicals .
our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings .
they get to close the loop with their products .
and they get to make more sustainable products .
in the short time period i have , i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue — it 's their waste — a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics .
we take out the things that are n't plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
and it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling .
we 're sieving the material , we 're using magnets , we 're using air classification .
it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics , not only by type , but by grade .
and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
we blend it in 50,000-lb . blending silos .
we push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
and we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
this is the same material that you would get from oil .
and today , we 're producing it from your old stuff , and it 's going right back into your new stuff .
( applause ) so now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home .
and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
so i hope i 've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
we took our clues from mother nature .
mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer — that 's a label i 've always hated my entire life — and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .
`` and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : `` '' if it 's broken , it 's my stuff . '' '' thank you for your time . ''

i wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation , sharing some of the problems .
and warren buffet had recommended i do that — being honest about what was going well , what was n't , and making it kind of an annual thing .
a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems , because i think there are some very important problems that do n't get worked on naturally .
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .
so this morning i 'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .
so that 's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate .
it 's a phenomenal thing .
each one of those lives matters a lot .
and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs : vaccines that were used more widely .
for example , measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 .
so we really can make changes .
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
and i think that 's doable in well under 20 years .
so that brings us to the first problem that i 'll raise this morning , which is how do we stop a deadly disease that 's spread by mosquitos ?
well , what 's the history of this disease ?
it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years .
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it 's the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .
deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s .
so it was absolutely gigantic .
and the disease was all over the world .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
people did n't know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
so it was everywhere .
and two tools helped bring the death rate down .
now , ironically , what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones , which is where the rich countries are .
so we can see : 1900 , it 's everywhere .
1945 , it 's still most places .
1970 , the u.s. and most of europe have gotten rid of it .
1990 , you 've gotten most of the northern areas .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it does n't get much investment .
for example , there 's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria .
now , baldness , it 's a terrible thing .
( laughter ) and rich men are afflicted .
and so that 's why that priority has been set .
but , malaria — even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .
over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .
it means that you ca n't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
we 'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
( laughter ) there 's no reason only poor people should have the experience .
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
and that 's happened now in a number of countries .
it 's great to see .
but we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
so every tool that we 've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .
and so you end up with two choices .
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication .
and that 's where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
or , if you go in kind of half-heartedly , for a period of time you 'll reduce the disease burden , but eventually those tools will become ineffective , and the death rate will soar back up again .
and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then did n't pay attention .
now we 're on the upswing .
bed net funding is up .
there 's new drug discovery going on .
our foundation has backed a vaccine that 's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months .
and that should save over two thirds of the lives if it 's effective .
so we 're going to have these new tools .
but that alone does n't give us the road map .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
it involves communicators to keep the funding high , to keep the visibility high , to tell the success stories .
it involves social scientists , so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets , but 90 percent .
we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this , to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together .
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
and so as these elements come together , i 'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .
now let me turn to a second question , a fairly different question , but i 'd say equally important .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on , and we 'd understand very well .
and the answer is , really , that we do n't .
let 's start with why this is important .
well , all of us here , i 'll bet , had some great teachers .
we all had a wonderful education .
that 's part of the reason we 're here today , part of the reason we 're successful .
i can say that , even though i 'm a college drop-out .
i had great teachers .
in fact , in the united states , the teaching system has worked fairly well .
there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent .
and they 've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront .
now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting .
not only has that been weak . it 's getting weaker .
and if you look at the economy , it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education .
and we have to change this .
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics .
when i first learned the statistics , i was pretty stunned at how bad things are .
over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
because they were n't tracking where the kids were before that .
but most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
they had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent .
for minority kids , it 's over 50 percent .
and even if you graduate from high school , if you 're low-income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree .
if you 're low-income in the united states , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .
and that does n't seem entirely fair .
so , how do you make education better ?
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
there 's many people working on it .
we 've worked on small schools , we 've funded scholarships , we 've done things in libraries .
a lot of these things had a good effect .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile — the very best — and the bottom quartile .
how much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class — based on test scores — by over 10 percent in a single year .
what does that mean ?
that means that if the entire u.s. , for two years , had top quartile teachers , the entire difference between us and asia would go away .
within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away .
so , it 's simple . all you need are those top quartile teachers .
`` and so you 'd say , `` '' wow , we should reward those people . ''
we should retain those people .
`` we should find out what they 're doing and transfer that skill to other people . '' '' but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today . ''
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
what do they look like ?
you might think these must be very senior teachers .
and the answer is no .
once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter .
the variation is very , very small .
you might think these are people with master 's degrees .
they 've gone back and they 've gotten their master 's of education .
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
that bottom thing , which says there 's no effect at all , is a master 's degree .
now , the way the pay system works is there 's two things that are rewarded .
one is seniority .
because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
the second is giving extra money to people who get their master 's degree .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
teach for america : slight effect .
for math teachers majoring in math there 's a measurable effect .
but , overwhelmingly , it 's your past performance .
there are some people who are very good at this .
and we 've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it , to raise the average capability — or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system .
`` you might say , `` '' do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher 's leave ? '' '' the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system . ''
and it 's a system with very high turnover .
now , there are a few places — very few — where great teachers are being made .
a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp .
kipp means knowledge is power .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
they have 66 schools — mostly middle schools , some high schools — and what goes on is great teaching .
they take the poorest kids , and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges .
and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
they 're team teaching . they 're constantly improving their teachers .
`` they 're taking data , the test scores , and saying to a teacher , `` '' hey , you caused this amount of increase . '' '' they 're deeply engaged in making teaching better . ''
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it 's very bizarre .
`` i sat down and i thought , `` '' what is going on ? '' '' the teacher was running around , and the energy level was high . ''
`` i thought , `` '' i 'm in the sports rally or something . ''
`` what 's going on ? '' '' and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids were n't paying attention , which kids were bored , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board . ''
it was a very dynamic environment , because particularly in those middle school years — fifth through eighth grade — keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention , nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who does n't want to be there .
everybody needs to be involved .
and so kipp is doing it .
how does that compare to a normal school ?
well , in a normal school , teachers are n't told how good they are .
the data is n't gathered .
in the teacher 's contract , it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom — sometimes to once per year .
and they need advanced notice to do that .
`` so imagine running a factory where you 've got these workers , some of them just making crap and the management is told , `` '' hey , you can only come down here once a year , but you need to let us know , because we might actually fool you , and try and do a good job in that one brief moment . '' '' even a teacher who wants to improve does n't have the tools to do it . ''
they do n't have the test scores , and there 's a whole thing of trying to block the data .
for example , new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers .
and so that 's sort of working in the opposite direction .
but i 'm optimistic about this , i think there are some clear things we can do .
first of all , there 's a lot more testing going on , and that 's given us the picture of where we are .
and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools .
`` and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say , `` '' ok , here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well . ''
here 's a little clip of something i think i did poorly .
`` advise me — when this kid acted up , how should i have dealt with that ? '' '' and they could all sit and work together on those problems . ''
you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it , have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff .
you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course , learn from that .
if you have a kid who 's behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .
and in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that dvds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
and so by thinking of this as a personnel system , we can do it much better .
`` now there 's a book actually , about kipp — the place that this is going on — that jay matthews , a news reporter , wrote — called , `` '' work hard , be nice . '' '' and i thought it was so fantastic . ''
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
i 'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .
( applause ) now , we put a lot of money into education , and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .
in fact we have in the stimulus bill — it 's interesting — the house version actually had money in it for these data systems , and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things .
but i — i 'm optimistic .
i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is , and it really can make a difference for millions of lives , if we get it right .
i only had time to frame those two problems .
there 's a lot more problems like that — aids , pneumonia — i can just see you 're getting excited , just at the very name of these things .
and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad .
you know , the system does n't naturally make it happen .
governments do n't naturally pick these things in the right way .
the private sector does n't naturally put its resources into these things .
so it 's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things , get other people involved — and you 're helping to come up with solutions .
and with that , i think there 's some great things that will come out of it .
thank you .
( applause )
when i was growing up in montana , i had two dreams .
i wanted to be a paleontologist , a dinosaur paleontologist , and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur .
and so that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life .
i was very fortunate early in my career .
i was fortunate in finding things .
i was n't very good at reading things .
in fact , i do n't read much of anything .
i am extremely dyslexic , and so reading is the hardest thing i do .
but instead , i go out and i find things .
then i just pick things up .
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
( laughter ) and i wander about the hills , and i have found a few things .
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests , the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones .
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs were n't the big , stupid , green reptiles that people had thought for so many years .
people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special .
and so , at that time , i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .
we were able to actually say that dinosaurs — based on the evidence we had — that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young , brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults .
the appearance of them would have been different — which it is in all social animals .
in social groups of animals , the juveniles always look different than the adults .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and so we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like .
and they did n't just all chase jeeps around .
( laughter ) but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton .
and in his book , he talked about the social animals .
and then steven spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
`` the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of `` '' jurassic park . '' '' michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life . ''
you all know the story , right .
`` i mean , i assume everyone here has seen `` '' jurassic park . '' '' if you want to make a dinosaur , you go out , you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap — otherwise known as amber — that has some blood-sucking insects in it , good ones , and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna , because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out . ''
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that , and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur .
and everybody 's happy about that .
( laughter ) and they 're happy over and over again .
they keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
and then , then , then , and then ...
then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness , and they get together , and they conspire .
and , of course , that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie — conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around .
so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it , and you drilled into it , and you got something out of that insect , and you cloned it , and you did it over and over and over again , you 'd have a room full of mosquitos .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
now if you want dinosaur dna , i say go to the dinosaur .
so that 's what we 've done .
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur , and we chose the dinosaur on the left , a tyrannosaurus rex , which was a very nice specimen .
and one of my former doctoral students , dr. mary schweitzer , actually had the background to do this sort of thing .
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex , one of the thigh bones , and she actually found some very interesting structures in there .
they found these red circular-looking objects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
and they 're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
so she sampled some material out of it .
now it was n't dna ; she did n't find dna .
but she did find heme , which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin .
and that was really cool .
that was interesting .
that was — here we have 65-million-year-old heme .
well we tried and tried and we could n't really get anything else out of it .
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell creek project .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
and out in eastern montana there 's a lot of space , a lot of badlands , and not very many people , and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
we found a lot of tyrannosaurs , but we found one special tyrannosaur , and we called it b-rex .
and b-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock .
it was n't a very complete t. rex , and it was n't a very big t. rex , but it was a very special b-rex .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
we do n't really know how long dinosaurs lived , because we have n't found the oldest one yet .
but this one died at the age of 16 .
we gave samples to mary schweitzer , and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when an animal is pregnant , when a bird is pregnant .
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs .
but mary went further .
she took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there should n't be anything left .
but there was something left .
there were blood vessels left .
there were flexible , clear blood vessels .
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur .
it was extraordinary .
but she also found osteocytes , which are the cells that laid down the bones .
and try and try , we could not find dna , but she did find evidence of proteins .
but we thought maybe — well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer , and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .
and we did . we got better material .
the cells looked better .
the vessels looked better .
found the protein collagen .
i mean , it was wonderful stuff .
but it 's not dinosaur dna .
so we have discovered that dinosaur dna , and all dna , just breaks down too fast .
`` we 're just not going to be able to do what they did in `` '' jurassic park . '' '' we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur . ''
but birds are dinosaurs .
birds are living dinosaurs .
we actually classify them as dinosaurs .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
so we do n't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them .
( laughter ) i know , you 're as bad as the sixth-graders . ( laughter )
`` the sixth-graders look at it and they say , `` '' no . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool . '' '' ( laughter ) `` the chicken is not . '' ( laughter ) ''
so this is our problem , as you can imagine .
the chicken is a dinosaur .
i mean it really is .
you ca n't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way .
( laughter ) ( applause ) but the sixth-graders demand it .
`` `` fix the chicken . '' ''
( laughter ) so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken .
so we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
we 'll call them biological modification tools .
we have selection .
and we know selection works .
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .
i mean , that 's — that 's definitely genetic modification .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
we also have transgenesis .
transgenesis is really cool too .
that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .
that 's how people make glofish .
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish , and , puff , they glow .
and that 's pretty cool .
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and now they 're making glow-rabbits and glow-all-sorts-of-things .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
( laughter ) but i do n't think that 'll satisfy the sixth-graders either .
but there 's another thing .
there 's what we call atavism activation .
and atavism activation is basically — an atavism is an ancestral characteristic .
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails , and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic .
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
and here 's an example .
this is a chicken with teeth .
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens .
now that 's a good characteristic .
we can save that one .
we know we can use that .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
that 's getting closer .
that 's better than a glowing chicken .
( laughter ) a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university , is actually looking at atavisms .
and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop , and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail .
he 's also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
he 's looking for those genes as well .
`` and i said , `` '' well , if you can find those , i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth-graders . '' '' and so he agreed . ''
and so that 's what we 're looking into .
if you look at dinosaur hands , a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it .
archaeopteryx , which is a bird , a primitive bird , still has that very primitive hand .
but as you can see , the pigeon , or a chicken or anything else , another bird , has kind of a weird-looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
it has the three fingers , the three digits .
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together .
and so what we 're looking for is that gene .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
and the same goes for the tails .
birds have basically rudimentary tails .
and so we know that in embryo , as the animal is developing , it actually has a relatively long tail .
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
so that 's the other gene we 're looking for .
we want to stop that tail from resorbing .
so what we 're trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chickenosaurus .
( laughter ) it 's a cooler-looking chicken .
but it 's just the very basics .
so that really is what we 're doing .
`` and people always say , `` '' why do that ? ''
why make this thing ?
`` what good is it ? '' '' well , that 's a good question . ''
actually , i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
( laughter ) anyway — when our dino-chicken hatches , it will be , obviously , the poster child , or what you might call a poster chick , for technology , entertainment and design .
thank you .
( applause )
vision is the most important and prioritized sense that we have .
we are constantly looking at the world around us , and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see .
let 's just start with an example of that very fact .
i 'm going to show you a photograph of a person , just for a second or two , and i 'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face .
ready ?
here you go . go with your gut reaction .
okay . what did you see ?
well , we actually surveyed over 120 individuals , and the results were mixed .
people did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face .
maybe you saw discomfort .
that was the most frequent response that we received .
so we are all looking at the very same face again .
we might see something entirely different , because perception is subjective .
what we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind 's eye .
of course , there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind 's eye .
and actually , our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people , including politicians .
so my research team and i decided to test this question .
in 2008 , barack obama was running for president for the very first time , and we surveyed hundreds of americans one month before the election .
of these people , 75 percent voted for obama in the actual election .
so how is that possible ?
how could it be that when i look at a person , an object , or an event , i see something very different than somebody else does ?
well , the reasons are many , but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work .
similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .
it 's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people 's minds .
i 'm talking about your language , of course , because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else 's mind , and they can attempt to do the same to you , without either of you having to perform surgery .
instead , when you speak , you 're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television .
it 's just that , whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light , your language relies on pulses , discrete pulses , of sound .
and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood , you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else 's brain to suit your interests .
languages are genes talking , getting things that they want .
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
now language 's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you ca n't read , phrases you ca n't use and words you ca n't say .
in fact , the tower of babel story in the bible is a fable and warning about the power of language .
according to that story , early humans developed the conceit that , by using their language to work together , they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven .
now god , angered at this attempt to usurp his power , destroyed the tower , and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt , he scattered the people by giving them different languages — confused them by giving them different languages .
and this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
even today , we know that there are words we can not use , phrases we can not say , because if we do so , we might be accosted , jailed , or even killed .
and all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths .
now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there 's something worth explaining .
and that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve , and why did it evolve only in our species ?
now it 's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees .
now these chimpanzees are using tools , and we take that as a sign of their intelligence .
but if they really were intelligent , why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel ?
and if they really were intelligent , why would they crack open nuts with a rock ?
why would n't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them ?
why not ? i mean , that 's what we do .
now the reason the chimpanzees do n't do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning .
they seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching .
as a result , they ca n't improve on others ' ideas or learn from others ' mistakes — benefit from others ' wisdom .
and so they just do the same thing over and over and over again .
in fact , we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts .
now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
how do we know this ?
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the homo erectus , did .
these upright apes evolved on the african savanna about two million years ago , and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands .
but if we look at the fossil record , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years .
you can follow it through the fossil record .
now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived , what their generation time was , that 's about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring , and other individuals watching , in which that hand axe did n't change .
it 's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives , the neanderthals , had social learning .
sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the neanderthals , lived in eurasia .
`` okay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old adage , `` monkey see , monkey do , '' the surprise really is that all of the other animals really can not do that — at least not very much . ''
and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it — something from a barnum & bailey circus .
but by comparison , we can learn .
we can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do .
we can then choose , from among a range of options , the best one .
we can benefit from others ' ideas .
we can build on their wisdom .
and as a result , our ideas do accumulate , and our technology progresses .
and this cumulative cultural adaptation , as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .
i mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago .
and all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation .
the chairs you 're sitting in , the lights in this auditorium , my microphone , the ipads and ipods that you carry around with you — all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation .
now to many commentators , cumulative cultural adaptation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
our species can make stuff , therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has .
`` in fact , we can even make the `` '' stuff of life '' '' — as i just said , all the stuff around us . ''
but in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story .
because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it 's fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
and most importantly for this , it 'll tell us why we have language .
and the reason that dilemma arose is , it turns out , that social learning is visual theft .
if i can learn by watching you , i can steal your best ideas , and i can benefit from your efforts , without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them .
if i can watch which lure you use to catch a fish , or i can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better , or if i follow you secretly to your mushroom patch , i can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills , and maybe even catch that fish before you do .
social learning really is visual theft .
and in any species that acquired it , it would behoove you to hide your best ideas , lest somebody steal them from you .
and so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
one of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups .
because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives .
had we chosen this option , sometime around 200,000 years ago , we would probably still be living like the neanderthals were when we first entered europe 40,000 years ago .
and this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas , there are fewer innovations .
and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
so if we 'd chosen that path , our evolutionary path would have led into the forest — and been a short one indeed .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others .
choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own .
well , we chose the second option , and language is the result .
language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation — for reaching agreements , for striking deals and for coordinating our activities .
and you can see that , in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language , not having language would be a like a bird without wings .
just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
and we take this utterly for granted , because we 're a species that is so at home with language , but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language .
and to see why , consider two scenarios from early in our evolution .
let 's imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads , but you 're hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached .
two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts , but they 're hopeless at making the arrowheads .
so what you do is — one of those people has not really acquired language yet .
and let 's pretend the other one is good at language skills .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that ca n't speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he 'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
but he looks at the pile of arrowheads , thinks they 're a gift , picks them up , smiles and walks off .
now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
a scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads .
okay , now replay this scene now , and you 're approaching the one who has language .
`` you put down your arrowheads and say , `` i 'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . i 'll split you 50/50 . '' ''
`` the other one says , `` '' fine . looks good to me . ''
`` we 'll do that . '' '' now the job is done . ''
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we could n't have before we acquired it .
and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , languishing .
that 's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites .
all right , if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true , any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity .
and this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
if you look at our ancestors , the neanderthals and the homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they 're confined to small regions of the world .
but when our species arose about 200,000 years ago , sometime after that we quickly walked out of africa and spread around the entire world , occupying nearly every habitat on earth .
now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to , with social learning and language , we could transform the environment to suit our needs .
and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
it is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised .
language really is the voice of our genes .
now having evolved language , though , we did something peculiar , even bizarre .
as we spread out around the world , we developed thousands of different languages .
currently , there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on earth .
now you might say , well , this is just natural .
as we diverge , our languages are naturally going to diverge .
but the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on earth is found where people are most tightly packed together .
if we go to the island of papua new guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone .
there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles .
now , incredible as this sounds , i once met a papuan man , and i asked him if this could possibly be true .
`` and he said to me , `` '' oh no . ''
`` they 're far closer together than that . '' '' and it 's true ; there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile . ''
and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
and so it seems that we use our language , not just to cooperate , but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities , and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside .
and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures , we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups .
they slow the flow of technologies .
and they even slow the flow of genes .
now i ca n't speak for you , but it seems to be the case that we do n't have sex with people we ca n't talk to .
( laughter ) now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the neanderthals and the denisovans . ( laughter )
okay , this tendency we have , this seemingly natural tendency we have , towards isolation , towards keeping to ourselves , crashes head first into our modern world .
this remarkable image is not a map of the world .
in fact , it 's a map of facebook friendship links .
and when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude , it literally draws a map of the world .
our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
and that communication , that connectivity around the world , that globalization now raises a burden .
because these different languages impose a barrier , as we 've just seen , to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom .
and they impose a barrier to cooperation .
and nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the european union , whose 27 member countries speak 23 official languages .
the european union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages .
that 's something on the order of 1.45 billion u.s. dollars on translation costs alone .
now think of the absurdity of this situation .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 253 translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities .
the european union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators .
and in 2007 alone — and i 'm sure there are more recent figures — something on the order of 1.3 million pages were translated into english alone .
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
and that question is whether in this modern , globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
to put it this way , nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist .
one of them always drives the other extinct .
and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring things — weighing them and measuring their length — but the metric system is winning .
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring time , but a really bizarre base 60 system known as hours and minutes and seconds is nearly universal around the world .
there are many , many ways of imprinting cds or dvds , but those are all being standardized as well .
and you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
and so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma .
and it 's the dilemma that this chinese man faces , who 's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language , and yet he is sitting at his blackboard , converting chinese phrases into english language phrases .
and what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange , and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity , his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language .
thank you .
( applause ) matt ridley : mark , one question .
svante found that the foxp2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in neanderthals as us .
do we have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if they also had language ?
mark pagel : this is a very good question .
so many of you will be familiar with the idea that there 's this gene called foxp2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that 's associated with language .
the reason why i do n't believe that tells us that the neanderthals had language is — here 's a simple analogy : ferraris are cars that have engines .
my car has an engine , but it 's not a ferrari .
now the simple answer then is that genes alone do n't , all by themselves , determine the outcome of very complicated things like language .
what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths — who knows .
but that does n't tell us they necessarily had language .
mr : thank you very much indeed .
( applause )
let me introduce to you rezero .
this little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at eth-zurich .
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots .
instead of wheels , a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground .
this means that the robot is inherently unstable .
it 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot .
you might ask yourself , what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable ?
now we 'll explain that in a second .
let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance .
rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately .
this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
now to move and to balance , rezero needs to turn the ball .
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
due to his instability , rezero is always in motion . now here 's the trick .
it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] .
let 's play a little .
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push .
in this mode , he 's trying to maintain his position .
for the next demo , i 'd like you to introduce to my colleagues michael , on the computer , and thomas who 's helping me onstage .
in the next mode , rezero is passive , and we can move him around .
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity .
i can also make him spin .
in the next mode , we can get rezero to follow a person .
he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas .
this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
we call this the orbiting mode .
all right , thank you , thomas .
( applause ) now , what 's the use of this technology ?
for now , it 's an experiment , but let me show you some possible future applications .
rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .
in a hospital , this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .
due to the ballbot system , it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around .
and of course , who would n't like to take a ride on one of these .
and these are more practical applications .
but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
so let me ask for a show of hands .
how many people here are over the age of 48 ?
well , congratulations , because if you look at this particular slide of u.s. life expectancy , you are now in excess of the average life span of somebody who was born in 1900 .
but look what happened in the course of that century .
if you follow that curve , you 'll see that it starts way down there .
there 's that dip there for the 1918 flu .
now , that 's the good news .
but there 's still a lot of work to do .
so , for instance , if you ask , how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis ?
turns out it 's about 4,000 , which is pretty amazing , because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while .
it 's exciting to see that in terms of what we 've learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
only about 250 .
you would think this would n't be too hard , that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we 're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we 've learned about basic science and its application , a bridge that would look maybe something like this , where you 'd have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other .
well , would n't it be nice if it was that easy ?
in reality , trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this .
there are no shiny bridges .
you sort of place your bets .
well , what does this really look like ?
well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ?
what 's a drug ? a drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape , and it 's those shapes that determine whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to hit its target .
is it going to land where it 's supposed to ?
so look at this picture here — a lot of shapes dancing around for you .
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
ultimately , maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these , and if all goes well , 14 years after you started , you will get one approval .
and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success .
how can we make this go faster ?
how can we make it more successful ?
well , let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked .
one that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis .
but it 's taken a long time to get there .
that picture you see there ?
here it is . that 's the same kid .
that 's danny bessette , 23 years later , because this is the year , and it 's also the year where danny got married , where we have , for the first time , the approval by the fda of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is , this drug does n't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis , and it wo n't work for danny , and we 're still waiting for that next generation to help him .
but it took 23 years to get this far . that 's too long .
fallen faster than moore 's law , down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced , or mine , and we 're headed for the $ 1,000 genome fairly soon .
well , that 's exciting .
how does that play out in terms of application to a disease ?
i want to tell you about another disorder .
this one is a disorder which is quite rare .
it 's called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
only about one in every four million kids has this disease , and in a simple way , what happens is , because of a mutation in a particular gene , a protein is made that 's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate .
let me show you a video of what that does to the cell .
a progeria cell , on the other hand , because of this toxic protein called progerin , has these lumps and bumps in it .
so what we would like to do after discovering this back in 2003 is to come up with a way to try to correct that .
well again , by knowing something about the molecular pathways , it was possible to pick one of those many , many compounds that might have been useful and try it out .
in an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon , if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria , and you watch to see what happened , in just 72 hours , that cell becomes , for all purposes that we can determine , almost like a normal cell .
well that was exciting , but would it actually work in a real human being ?
this has led , in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial , to a test of that very compound .
and the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this , 28 of them , and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other .
and instead of telling you more about it , i 'm going to invite one of them , sam berns from boston , who 's here this morning , to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria .
sam is 15 years old . his parents , scott berns and leslie gordon , both physicians , are here with us this morning as well .
sam , please have a seat .
( applause ) so sam , why do n't you tell these folks what it 's like being affected with this condition called progeria ?
sam burns : well , progeria limits me in some ways .
i can not play sports or do physical activities , but i have been able to take interest in things that progeria , luckily , does not limit .
( applause ) francis collins : so what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this ?
what would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well ?
sb : well , research on progeria has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria , and it shows that if that drive exists , anybody can cure any disease , and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future , and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases that francis was talking about .
please join me in thanking and welcoming sam .
sb : thank you very much . fc : well done . well done , buddy .
( applause ) so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
you might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
turned out , it did n't work very well for cancer , but it has exactly the right properties , the right shape , to work for progeria , and that 's what 's happened .
would n't it be great if we could do that more systematically ?
that could be a phenomenal , valuable activity .
there are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances .
the first drug for hiv/aids was not developed for hiv/aids .
it was developed for cancer . it was azt .
it did n't work very well for cancer , but became the first successful antiretroviral , and you can see from the table there are others as well .
so how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ?
well , we have to come up with a partnership between academia , government , the private sector , and patient organizations to make that so .
it just started last december , and this is one of its goals .
how do we know , for instance , whether drugs are safe before we give them to people ? we test them on animals .
and it 's not all that reliable , and it 's costly , and it 's time-consuming .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
you probably know , if you 've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
so what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it 's going to be safe ?
here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
this is something created by the wyss institute in boston , and what they have done here , if we can run the little video , is to take cells from an individual , turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung , and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe .
you can see this chip even breathes .
it has an air channel . it has a blood channel .
are those cells happy or not ?
you can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys , for hearts , for muscles , all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem , for the liver .
and ultimately , because you can do this for the individual , we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip , what we 're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety .
so let me sum up .
we are in a remarkable moment here .
we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world .
what do we need to capitalize on this ? first of all , we need resources .
this is research that 's high-risk , sometimes high-cost .
the payoff is enormous , both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth . we need to support that .
and third , and maybe most important , we need talent .
we need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort — all ages , all different groups — because this is the time , folks .
i hope that 's your goal .
i think it 'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we 're trying to do here and why it matters .
it matters for now . it matters as soon as possible .
if you do n't believe me , just ask sam .
thank you all very much .
( applause )
do you remember the story of odysseus and the sirens from high school or junior high school ?
there was this hero , odysseus , who 's heading back home after the trojan war .
`` and he 's standing on the deck of his ship , he 's talking to his first mate , and he 's saying , `` '' tomorrow , we will sail past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called sirens . ''
`` and these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die . '' '' now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens , but instead odysseus says , `` '' i want to hear that song . ''
`` and so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men — stay with me — so that you ca n't hear the song , and then i 'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected . '' '' so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song . ''
and i 'd like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times .
`` odysseus would have said , `` '' okay , let 's do a dry run . ''
you tie me to the mast , and i 'm going to beg and plead .
and no matter what i say , you can not untie me from the mast .
`` all right , so tie me to the mast . '' '' and the first mate takes a rope and ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot . ''
`` and odysseus does his best job playacting and says , `` '' untie me . untie me . ''
`` i want to hear that song . untie me . '' '' and the first mate wisely resists and does n't untie odysseus . ''
`` and then odysseus says , `` '' i see that you can get it . ''
`` all right , untie me now and we 'll get some dinner . '' '' and the first mate hesitates . ''
`` he 's like , `` '' is this still the rehearsal , or should i untie him ? '' '' and the first mate thinks , `` well , i guess at some point the rehearsal has to end . '' ''
so he unties odysseus , and odysseus flips out .
`` he 's like , `` '' you idiot . you moron . ''
if you do that tomorrow , i 'll be dead , you 'll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
`` now just do n't untie me no matter what . '' '' he throws the first mate to the ground . ''
this repeats itself through the night — rehearsal , tying to the mast , conning his way out of it , beating the poor first mate up mercilessly .
hilarity ensues .
tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you do n't do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
because there 's two heads inside one person when you think about it .
scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
there is first , the present self .
this is like odysseus when he 's hearing the song .
he just wants to get to the front row .
he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification .
but then there 's this other self , the future self .
this is odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca — the other one .
so why do we need commitment devices ?
`` well resisting temptation is hard , as the 19th century english economist nassau william senior said , `` '' to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power , or to seek distant rather than immediate results , are among the most painful exertions of the human will . '' '' if you set goals for yourself and you 're like a lot of other people , you probably realize it 's not that your goals are physically impossible that 's keeping you from achieving them , it 's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them . ''
it 's physically possible to lose weight .
it 's physically possible to exercise more .
but resisting temptation is hard .
the other reason that it 's difficult to resist temptation is because it 's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self .
i mean , let 's face it , the present self is present .
it 's in control . it 's in power right now .
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .
and the future self is not even around .
it 's off in the future . it 's weak .
it does n't even have a lawyer present .
there 's nobody to stick up for the future self .
and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
so there 's this battle between the two selves that 's being fought , and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two .
now i 'm a big fan of commitment devices actually .
tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one , but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you wo n't eat it or unplugging your internet connection so you can use your computer .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
so when i was a starving post-doc at columbia university , i was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career .
i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars .
and when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details .
because it 's not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
i mean , you ca n't burn it ; that 's illegal .
and i thought , well i could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that .
but then i thought , oh , i 'm sending myself mixed messages .
because not writing is bad , but giving to charity is good .
so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift .
and then i kind of flipped that around and thought , well i could give it to the neo-nazis .
but then i was like , that 's more bad than writing is good , and so that would n't work .
so ultimately , i just decided i would leave it in an envelope on the subway .
sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
on average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret .
( laughter ) such it is with commitment devices .
but despite my like for them , there 's two nagging concerns that i 've always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
so the first is , when you 've got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it 's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .
`` you 're just telling yourself , `` '' without you , commitment device , i am nothing , i have no self-discipline . '' '' and then when you 're ever in a situation where you do n't have a commitment device in place — like , `` '' oh my god , that person 's offering me a doughnut , and i have no defense mechanism , '' '' — you just eat it . ''
so i do n't like the way that they take the power away from you .
i think self-discipline is something , it 's like a muscle .
the more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
`` you say , `` '' well , of course i ca n't write today , because i 'm giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i 'm going to a cocktail party and then i 'll be drunk after that . ''
`` and so there 's no way that this is going to work . '' '' so in effect , you are like odysseus and the first mate in one person . ''
you 're putting yourself , you 're binding yourself , and you 're weaseling your way out of it , and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards .
so i 've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people 's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices .
in particular , i 'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
and this is a timely issue .
i 'm talking about the topic of saving .
now saving is a classic two selves problem .
the present self does not want to save at all .
it wants to consume .
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
so this is a timely problem .
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
at the same time , the retirement risk index , the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement , has been increasing .
and we 're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they 're in retirement .
so what can we do about this ?
there 's a philosopher , derek parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i .
`` he said that , `` '' we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination . '' '' that is to say , we somehow might not believe that we 're going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we 're going to get old some day . ''
on the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
of course , we know that we 're going to get old .
but are n't there things that we believe and do n't believe at the same time ?
so my coauthors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people 's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
and i 'll show you some of these tools right here .
the first is called the distribution builder .
it shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future .
each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .
being up at the top means that you 're enjoying a high income in retirement .
being down at the bottom means that you 're struggling to make ends meet .
`` when you make an investment , what you 're really saying is , `` '' i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . '' '' now you can try to move your outcomes around . ''
you can try to manipulate your fate , like this person is doing , but it costs you something to do it .
it means that you have to save more today .
`` once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click `` '' done '' '' and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one . ''
it simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out .
at the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .
yes , this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement .
they 're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
if you 're like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy — just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before .
however , had you ended up on the very bottom , it might have given you a slight sense of dread and/or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement .
by using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome , people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future .
now people are motivated through emotions , but different people find different things motivating .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , i show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you 're retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on .
as you move down the ladder of apartments , you see that they get worse and worse .
some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student .
and as you get to the very bottom , you 're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you do n't save anything for retirement , you wo n't be able to afford any housing at all .
those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the internet .
the last thing i 'll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
and what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
so what we do is we take pictures of people — in this case , college-age people — and we use software to age them and show these people what they 'll look like when they 're 60 , 70 , 80 years old .
and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .
so this is one of our experiments .
here we see the face of the young subject on the left .
he 's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate .
as he moves his savings rate down , it means that he 's saving zero when it 's all the way here at the left .
you can see his current annual income — this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today — is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low .
he 's going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working .
if he saves the maximum legal amount , his retirement income goes up , but he 's unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today .
other conditions show people the future self .
and from the future self 's point of view , everything is in reverse .
if you save very little , the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income .
whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent .
to bring this to a wider audience , i 've been working with hal and allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth .
so for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
the younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing .
the older face is miserable .
and slowly , slowly we 're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .
and then it 's a high savings rate .
the younger face is getting unhappy .
the older face is quite pleased with the decision .
we 're going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
and what 's nice about it is it 's not something that biasing people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face frowns .
it 's not telling you which way to put the slider , it 's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self .
your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
and that 's something that 's easy to forget .
this use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older .
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on .
and what 's good is , unlike in the experiments that hal and myself ran with russ smith , you do n't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality .
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
this is actually a picture of hal , my coauthor .
you might recognize him from the previous demos .
and just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
hal is here , so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .
and i 'll close it there .
on behalf of hal and myself , i wish all the best to your present and future selves .
thank you .

the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional .
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
for instance , just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft .
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
( laughter ) ... if we use pennies .
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say dangerously powerful , insight .
but it 's also a morally important one .
because this is n't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we 're talking about , but this is actual economic losses .
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sorghum — whatever sorghum is — losing sorghum .
so that 's a chunk of what we 're looking for .
but total movie revenues across theaters , home video and pay-per-view are up .
and tv , satellite and cable revenues are way up .
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling .
( laughter ) ( applause ) since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms , it 's not additional growth that piracy has prevented , but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms — one that did n't exist in the 90 's .
what we 're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .
other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people .
and this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day .
it 's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
now when this law first passed , the world 's hottest mp3 player could hold just 10 songs .
and it was a big christmas hit .
because what little hoodlum would n't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
i want to talk to you about my kids .
because what i see in them is myself — or what would have been myself .
at five years old , i thought everyone had a life just like mine .
at five years old , i thought everyone was just like me .
these are things my kids do n't get .
why does n't everyone get this ?
why is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich ?
it was like i had some sort of survivor 's remorse .
i think we 've got it all wrong .
an oversimplification of american educational history .
blacks were kept out — you know , the whole slavery thing .
for years , i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading .
`` and then they 'd say , almost suspiciously , `` but they 're brand-new . '' ''
really ?
until then , there 's no democracy in our democratic education .
what is a carpenter with no tools ?
what is an actress with no stage ?
what is a scientist with no laboratory ?
what is a doctor with no equipment ?
i 'll tell you : they 're my kids .
should n't they be your kids , too ?
i 'm a brain scientist , and as a brain scientist , i 'm actually interested in how the brain learns , and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter , better and faster .
this is in this context i 'm going to tell you about video games . when we say video games , most of you think about children .
it 's true . ninety percent of children do play video games .
but let 's be frank .
when the kids are in bed , who is in front of the playstation ?
so what we are asking in the lab is , how can we leverage that power ?
( shooting noises ) the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
most parents would find that great .
well , i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
it 's not , and binging is never good .
and so i 'm going to take a few examples from our work .
one first saying that i 'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
it 's better than those that do n't play .
and it 's better in two different ways .
another saying that i 'm sure you have all heard around : video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
i 'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so .
right ? so this is the first example .
`` [ `` '' board '' '' ] audience : red.daphne bavelier : red . ''
`` [ `` '' horse '' '' ] db : yellow . audience : yellow . ''
`` [ `` '' yellow '' '' ] db : red . audience : yellow . ''
`` [ `` '' blue '' '' ] db : yellow . ''
you 're also keeping track of the pedestrian , the running dog , and that 's how you can actually be safe driving , right ?
but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat .
was it yellow initially or blue ?
yellow or blue ?
audience : yellow.db : good .
so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention .
that 's what we just did . your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention , which is what is shown in this video here .
that 's for you guys , action video game players .
now , we can measure that kind of skills in the lab .
when we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really , really good .
they switch really fast , very swiftly . they pay a very small cost .
that 's a multimedia-tasker .
there was a first study done by colleagues at stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking .
when we measure them in the lab , they 're really bad .
right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points .
the first one is that not all media are created equal .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
i 'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game , i can actually change your vision for the better , whether you want to play that action game or not , right ?
that 's the point of rehabilitation or education .
`` most of the kids do n't go to school saying , `` great , two hours of math ! '' ''
so that 's really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
and one more step is to do training studies .
mental rotation is a task where i 'm going to ask you , and again you 're going to do the task , to look at this shape . study it , it 's a target shape , and i 'm going to present to you four different shapes .
okay , i 'll help you . fourth one .
one more . get those brains working . come on .
that 's our target shape .
third . good ! this is hard , right ?
it does n't really feel like playing mindless action video games .
they do n't play 10 hours of action games in a row .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
well , we 're working on it , but here is a challenge .
that 's the chocolate side of the equation .
who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
and i would like to explain to you not only why it 's time to change this , but also how we can do it .
as you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get , investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money .
a rating can range from a so-called aaa , which means it 's a top-performing product , and it can go down to the level of the so-called bbb- , which means it 's a fairly risky investment .
rating agencies are rating companies .
they are rating banks .
they are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities .
and i can tell , as you 're listening to me right now , you 're thinking , so why should i really care about this , right ?
be honest .
well , ratings affect you .
they affect all of us .
if a rating agency rates a country , it basically assesses and evaluates a country 's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt .
so it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer , because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow .
but what if a country ca n't afford to pay more because it 's maybe too expensive ?
well , then the country has less available for other services , like roads , schools , healthcare .
and this is the reason why you should care , because sovereign ratings affect everyone .
and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods .
they should be transparent , accessible , and available to everyone at no cost .
but here 's the situation : the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only — standard & poor 's , moody 's , and fitch — and we know whenever there is a market concentration , there is really no competition .
there is no incentive to improve the quality of your product .
and let 's face it , the credit rating agencies have contributed , putting the global economy on the brink , and yet they have to change the way they operate .
the second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
obviously not , right ? that would be irresponsible .
but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
the third point is , the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings , but in this day and age , you ca n't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that 's inside .
but for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
we are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work , and we need to change this .
i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trimming at the margins .
i think it 's time for a bold move .
i think it 's time to upgrade the system .
and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector .
and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk , and we call it by its acronym , incra .
incra would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix .
it would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment .
the endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation , to run the rating agency , and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available .
but this is not enough to make a difference , right ?
incra would also be based on a very , very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest , and it would include many stakeholders from society .
incra would not only be a european or an american rating agency , it would be a truly international one , in which , in particular , the emerging economies would have an equal interest , voice and representation .
the second big difference that incra would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators .
think about it that way .
if we conduct a sovereign rating , we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country , its macroeconomic fundamentals .
but we also have to ask the question , who is cultivating the economic soil of a country , right ?
well , a country has many gardeners , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
how is it managed ?
and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
i hope you would agree it 's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education .
for example , if incra would rate south africa right now , of course we would take a very , very close look at the youth unemployment of the country , the highest in the world .
if over 70 percent of a country 's population under the age of 35 is unemployed , of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future .
well , our friends at moody 's , standard & poor 's , and fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well .
but guess what ? we do not know exactly how they will take this into account .
and this leads me to the third big difference that incra would make .
incra would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology .
so in contrast to the current system , incra would be fully transparent .
so in a nutshell , incra would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new , nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition , it would increase the transparency of the sector , and it would also increase the quality .
i can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world , but i tell you it 's a very important one , and a very important one to fix , because sovereign ratings affect all of us , and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods .
and this is why we are testing our model right now , and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring incra to life .
because for way too long , we have left the big financial players on their own .
it 's time to give them some company .
thank you .

i still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 .
i 'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i 've done during my first five tedtalks .
instead , i have progressed , and i am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea : this box .
this box contains one billion people .
and our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people .
in the developing world , she said , they had two billion people .
and they lived away then .
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
in the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
and their aspiration was to buy a car .
and in 1960 , all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this .
this was the economic level at which sweden was .
but in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day .
they were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up .
`` and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about `` '' the west '' '' and `` '' the developing world . '' '' but the world has changed , and it 's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it . ''
and that 's what i 'm going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population .
just look how many .
the world population has doubled since i went to school .
and of course , there 's been economic growth in the west .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here .
and now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
so this is where they are today .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
they are now buying cars .
and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company , geely , they acquired the volvo company , and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world .
( laughter ) so there they are .
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those [ richer also ] have .
and their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also .
but this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
but the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever .
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
this is the new world we have today in 2010 .
and what will happen in the future ?
well , i 'm going to project into 2050 .
i was in shanghai recently , and i listened to what 's happening in china , and it 's pretty sure that they will catch up , just as japan did .
all the projections [ say that ] this one [ billion ] will [ only ] grow with one to two or three percent .
[ but this second ] grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here .
they will start flying .
and these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
and if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology — so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap — then they will move all the way up here .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
this is what we will find there .
so what about the poorest two billion ?
what about the poorest two billion here ?
will they move on ?
well , here population [ growth ] comes in because there [ among emerging economies ] we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end .
here [ among the poorest ] , population is growing .
so these [ poorest ] two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion .
there is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we 've never seen — that can stop this [ growth ] from happening .
because we already have this [ growth ] in process .
but if , and only if , [ the poorest ] get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [ to live ] here , then population growth will stop in 2050 .
we can not have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
and let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
here i have on the screen my country bubbles .
every bubble is a country . the size is population .
the colors show the continent .
the yellow on there is the americas ; dark blue is africa ; brown is europe ; green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia .
that 's india and this is china . size is population .
here i have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families .
the year is 1960 .
and down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
what has happened ? i start the world . here we go .
can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
they get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . family size is decreasing .
[ when ] they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there [ to small families ] .
look , bangladesh catching up with india .
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
can you see the poorest billion , those [ two ] boxes i had over here ?
they are still up here .
and they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
and the population will double in one generation .
so the only way of really getting world population [ growth ] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
that 's why investments by gates foundation , unicef and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world .
we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
child survival is the new green .
it 's only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
and will it happen ?
well , i 'm not an optimist , neither am i a pessimist .
`` i 'm a very serious `` '' possibilist . '' '' it 's a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world . ''
it can be done .
we can have a much more just world .
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
and look at the position of the old west .
remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
this will not happen [ again ] .
the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less .
but it 's a very important role .
do it well and get used to it .
thank you very much .
( applause )
this is the large hadron collider .
it 's 27 kilometers in circumference .
it 's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .
over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
what we do is we accelerate protons — so , hydrogen nuclei — around 99.999999 percent the speed of light .
right ? at that speed , they go around that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second .
and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction .
we collide them inside giant detectors .
they 're essentially digital cameras .
and this is the one that i work on , atlas .
you get some sense of the size — you can just see these eu standard-size people underneath .
( laughter ) you get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
and we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector — immense numbers .
and if you see those metal bits there — those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they 're traveling .
this is a picture about a year ago .
those magnets are in there .
and , again , a eu standard-size , real person , so you get some sense of the scale .
and it 's in there that those mini-big bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
and actually , this morning , i got an email saying that we 've just finished , today , building the last piece of atlas .
so as of today , it 's finished . i 'd like to say that i planned that for ted , but i did n't . so it 's been completed as of today .
( applause ) yeah , it 's a wonderful achievement .
`` so , you might be asking , `` '' why ? ''
`` why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began ? '' '' well , particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious . ''
and the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything 's made of , and how everything sticks together .
and by everything i mean , of course , me and you , the earth , the sun , the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
absolutely everything .
`` now you might say , `` '' well , ok , but why not just look at it ? ''
`` you know ? if you want to know what i 'm made of , let 's look at me . '' '' well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets hotter and hotter , denser and denser , and simpler and simpler . ''
now , there 's no real reason i 'm aware of for that , but that seems to be the case .
so , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and understandable .
all this complexity , all the way to these wonderful things — human brains — are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .
back at the start , in the first billionth of a second , we believe , or we 've observed , it was very simple .
it 's almost like ...
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it 's an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it 'll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h20 , water .
so it 's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of .
and , as of today , it 's made of these things .
just 12 particles of matter , stuck together by four forces of nature .
the quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
the electron — the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus — held around in orbit , by the way , by the electromagnetic force that 's carried by this thing , the photon .
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
and these guys , here , they 're the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
but , without it , the sun would n't shine .
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
actually , if you just look at your thumbnail — about a square centimeter — there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun , passing through every square centimeter of your body .
but you do n't feel them , because the weak force is correctly named — very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
and these particles have been discovered over the last century , pretty much .
the first one , the electron , was discovered in 1897 , and the last one , this thing called the tau neutrino , in the year 2000. actually just — i was going to say , just up the road in chicago . i know it 's a big country , america , is n't it ?
just up the road .
relative to the universe , it 's just up the road .
( laughter ) so , this thing was discovered in the year 2000 , so it 's a relatively recent picture .
one of the wonderful things , actually , i find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
you know , they 're a step in size from the entire observable universe .
so , 100 billion galaxies , 13.7 billion light years away — a step in size from that to monterey , actually , is about the same as from monterey to these things .
absolutely , exquisitely minute , and yet we 've discovered pretty much the full set .
`` so , one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university , ernest rutherford , discoverer of the atomic nucleus , once said , `` '' all science is either physics or stamp collecting . '' '' now , i do n't think he meant to insult the rest of science , although he was from new zealand , so it 's possible . ''
( laughter ) but what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
ok , we 've discovered the particles , but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern — you know , why it 's built the way it is — really you 've done stamp collecting . you have n't done science .
fortunately , we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern .
it 's the newton 's laws , if you want , of particle physics .
it 's called the standard model — beautifully simple mathematical equation .
you could stick it on the front of a t-shirt , which is always the sign of elegance .
this is it .
( laughter ) i 've been a little disingenuous , because i 've expanded it out in all its gory detail .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything — other than gravity — that happens in the universe .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together — in principle , you 've got a big enough computer — why dna is the shape it is .
in principle , you should be able to calculate it from that equation .
but there 's a problem .
can anyone see what it is ?
a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
i 'll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
basically , each of these terms refers to some of the particles .
so those ws there refer to the ws , and how they stick together .
these carriers of the weak force , the zs , the same .
but there 's an extra symbol in this equation : h .
right , h .
h stands for higgs particle .
higgs particles have not been discovered .
but they 're necessary : they 're necessary to make that mathematics work .
so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation would n't be possible without an extra bit .
so it 's a prediction : a prediction of a new particle .
what does it do ?
well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
`` and back in the 1980s , when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u.k. government , margaret thatcher , at the time , said , `` '' if you guys can explain , in language a politician can understand , what the hell it is that you 're doing , you can have the money . ''
`` i want to know what this higgs particle does . '' '' and we came up with this analogy , and it seemed to work . ''
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
and the picture is that the whole universe — and that does n't mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you — the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field .
higgs particles , if you will .
the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
but imagine someone who 's not very popular moves through the room .
then everyone ignores them . they can just pass through the room very quickly , essentially at the speed of light . they 're massless .
and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room .
they 're surrounded by people , and their passage through the room is impeded .
it 's almost like they get heavy . they get massive .
and that 's exactly the way the higgs mechanism works .
the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy , in a sense , and massive , because they 're surrounded by higgs particles .
they 're interacting with the higgs field .
if that picture 's true , then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc .
if it 's not true — because it 's quite a convoluted mechanism , although it 's the simplest we 've been able to think of — then whatever does the job of the higgs particles we know have to turn up at the lhc .
so , that 's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine .
i 'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher .
actually , i thought about making it more culturally relevant , but — ( laughter ) anyway .
so that 's one thing .
that 's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find .
there are many other things . you 've heard many of the big problems in particle physics .
one of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature — it 's quite beautiful , actually — seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
well , they do change in strength .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
the strong force , the strong nuclear force , which sticks nuclei together , gets weaker . and what you see is the standard model — you can calculate how these change — is the forces , the three forces , other than gravity , almost seem to come together at one point .
it 's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force , back at the beginning of time .
but they just miss .
now there 's a theory called super-symmetry , which doubles the number of particles in the standard model , which , at first sight , does n't sound like a simplification .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang — absolutely beautiful prophecy . the model was n't built to do that , but it seems to do it .
also , those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter .
so a very compelling theory that 's really mainstream physics .
and if i was to put money on it , i would put money on — in a very unscientific way — that that these things would also crop up at the lhc .
many other things that the lhc could discover .
but in the last few minutes , i just want to give you a different perspective of what i think — what particle physics really means to me — particle physics and cosmology .
and that 's that i think it 's given us a wonderful narrative — almost a creation story , if you 'd like — about the universe , from modern science over the last few decades .
and i 'd say that it deserves , in the spirit of wade davis ' talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north .
this is a creation story , i think , equally as wonderful .
the story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
it began to expand about a million , billion , billion , billion billionth of a second — i think i got that right — after the big bang .
gravity separated away from the other forces .
the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation .
in about the first billionth of a second or so , the higgs field kicked in , and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass .
the universe continued to expand and cool .
after about a few minutes , there was hydrogen and helium in the universe . that 's all .
the universe was about 75 percent hydrogen , 25 percent helium . it still is today .
it continued to expand about 300 million years .
then light began to travel through the universe .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god .
after about 400 million years , the first stars formed , and that hydrogen , that helium , then began to cook into the heavier elements .
so the elements of life — carbon , and oxygen and iron , all the elements that we need to make us up — were cooked in those first generations of stars , which then ran out of fuel , exploded , threw those elements back into the universe .
they then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
on at least one , and maybe only one of those planets , primitive life evolved , which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania , and eventually left a footprint on another world .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
as one of my great heroes , carl sagan , said , these are the things — and actually , not only these , but i was looking around — these are the things , like saturn v rockets , and sputnik , and dna , and literature and science — these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years .
absolutely remarkable .
and , the laws of physics . right ?
so , the right laws of physics — they 're beautifully balanced .
if the weak force had been a little bit different , then carbon and oxygen would n't be stable inside the hearts of stars , and there would be none of that in the universe .
and i think that 's a wonderful and significant story .
50 years ago , i could n't have told that story , because we did n't know it .
it makes me really feel that that civilization — which , as i say , if you believe the scientific creation story , has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics , and a few hydrogen atoms — then i think , to me anyway , it makes me feel incredibly valuable .
so that 's the lhc .
the lhc is certainly , when it turns on in summer , going to write the next chapter of that book .
and i 'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
thanks .

democracy .
in the west , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted .
we tend to think of it as an intransigent given .
we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
it does n't .
singapore 's lee kuan yew and his great imitators in beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy-free .
indeed , democracy is receding in our neck of the woods , here in europe .
at that moment , i felt that there could be no greater vindication of lee kuan yew , or the chinese communist party , indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything .
tonight , here , i want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy .
i want to ask you to join me in believing again that lee kuan yew , the chinese communist party and indeed the eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy — that we need an authentic , boisterous democracy .
and without democracy , our societies will be nastier , our future bleak and our great , new technologies wasted .
speaking of waste , allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak .
i call it the twin peaks paradox .
one peak you understand — you know it , you recognize it — is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the united states , europe , the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debts .
but few people discern its twin .
a mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations , too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs , like green energy .
now let me give you two numbers .
over the last three months , in the united states , in britain and in the eurozone , we have invested , collectively , 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods — things like industrial plants , machinery , office blocks , schools , roads , railways , machinery , and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries , in our financial institutions , doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices .
so a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks , failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets .
the result is stagnant wages , more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in america , in japan and in europe out of work .
and consequently , low aggregate demand , which in a never-ending cycle , reinforces the pessimism of the investors , who , fearing low demand , reproduce it by not investing — exactly like oedipus ' father , who , terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him , unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that oedipus , his son , would kill him .
this is my quarrel with capitalism .
its gross wastefulness , all this idle cash , should be energized to improve lives , to develop human talents , and indeed to finance all these technologies , green technologies , which are absolutely essential for saving planet earth .
am i right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
i believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democracy ?
aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor , being in the majority , control government .
now , of course athenian democracy excluded too many .
women , migrants and , of course , the slaves .
but it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded .
what was more pertinent , and continues to be so about ancient athenian democracy , was the inclusion of the working poor , who not only acquired the right to free speech , but more importantly , crucially , they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state .
now , of course , athenian democracy did n't last long .
like a candle that burns brightly , it burned out quickly .
and indeed , our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient athens .
they have their roots in the magna carta , in the 1688 glorious revolution , indeed in the american constitution .
whereas athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor , our liberal democracies are founded on the magna carta tradition , which was , after all , a charter for masters .
and indeed , liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere , so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere , leaving the economic sphere — the corporate world , if you want — as a democracy-free zone .
now , in our democracies today , this separation of the economic from the political sphere , the moment it started happening , it gave rise to an inexorable , epic struggle between the two , with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere , eating into its power .
have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be ?
it 's not because their dna has degenerated .
( laughter ) it is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere , which is separate .
indeed , i spoke about my quarrel with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of predators , that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on , that in the end they starve .
similarly , the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself , causing economic crisis .
corporate power is increasing , political goods are devaluing , inequality is rising , aggregate demand is falling and ceos of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations .
so the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy , the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity 's wealth .
clearly , if this is right , we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control , like in ancient athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants .
now , this is not an original idea .
the marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it did n't go very well , did it ?
the lesson that we learned from the soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered , as they were in ancient athens , without creating new forms of brutality and waste .
but there is a solution : eliminate the working poor .
capitalism 's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata , androids , robots .
the problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate , automation makes the twin peaks taller , the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper , including — soon , i believe — in places like china .
so we need to reconfigure , we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres , but we 'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere , lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes the matrix , the movie , look like a documentary .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a matrix dystopia or something much closer to a star trek-like society , where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient , athenian-like , high tech agora .
i think we can afford to be optimistic .
but what would it take , what would it look like to have this star trek-like utopia , instead of the matrix-like dystopia ?
in practical terms , allow me to share just briefly , a couple of examples .
at the level of the enterprise , imagine a capital market , where you earn capital as you work , and where your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company — whichever one you happen to work at at that time — is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment .
then all income stems from capital , from profits , and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete .
no more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company ; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor ; no great gap between investment and saving ; indeed , no towering twin peaks .
at the level of the global political economy , imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate , with a universal , global , digital currency , one that is issued by the international monetary fund , the g-20 , on behalf of all humanity .
`` and imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency — let 's call it `` '' the cosmos , '' '' in units of cosmos — with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country 's trade deficit , or indeed to a country 's trade surplus . ''
and imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce .
this is not a new idea .
it 's what , effectively , john maynard keynes proposed in 1944 at the bretton woods conference .
the problem is that back then , they did n't have the technology to implement it .
now we do , especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere .
the world that i am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian , in that it prioritizes empowered individuals , marxist , since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor , and keynesian , global keynesian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy .
will such a world dawn ?
or shall we descend into a matrix-like dystopia ?
the answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively .
it is our choice , and we 'd better make it democratically .
thank you .
( applause ) bruno giussani : yanis ...
it was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian marxist .
what is the relevance of marx 's analysis today ?
yanis varoufakis : well , if there was any relevance in what i just said , then marx is relevant .
because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is — if we do n't do it , then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand , what larry summers refers to as secular stagnation .
with this crisis migrating from one part of the world , as it is now , it will destabilize not only our democracies , but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy .
so if this analysis holds water , then marx is absolutely relevant .
but so is hayek , that 's why i 'm a libertarian marxist , and so is keynes , so that 's why i 'm totally confused .
( applause ) yv : if you are not confused , you are not thinking , ok ?
would you like to share that ?
yv : well , there 's a great degree of hypocrisy .
in our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .
in a sense , if i am allowed to be provocative , china today is closer to britain in the 19th century .
because remember , we tend to associate liberalism with democracy — that 's a mistake , historically .
liberalism , liberal , it 's like john stuart mill .
john stuart mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process .
so what you are seeing now in china is a very similar process to the one that we had in britain during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
and to be castigating china for doing that which the west did in the 19th century , smacks of hypocrisy .
bg : i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the finance minister of greece earlier this year .
yv : i knew this was coming .
bg : yes .
bg : six months after , how do you look back at the first half of the year ?
not just greece , the eurozone .
to move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive — and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the eurozone , which is threatening , massively , the whole of the european union process .
we had an opportunity on the basis of the greek program — which by the way , was the first program to manifest that denial — to put it right .
and , unfortunately , the powers in the eurozone , in the eurogroup , chose to maintain denial .
but you know what happens .
this is the experience of the soviet union .
when you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally can not survive , through political will and through authoritarianism , you may succeed in prolonging it , but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically .
bg : what kind of change are you foreseeing ?
yv : well , there 's no doubt that if we do n't change the architecture of the eurozone , the eurozone has no future .
bg : did you make any mistakes when you were finance minister ?
yv : every day .
bg : for example ? yv : anybody who looks back — ( applause ) no , but seriously .
if there 's any minister of finance , or of anything else for that matter , who tells you after six months in a job , especially in such a stressful situation , that they have made no mistake , they 're dangerous people .
of course i made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of february .
and there was n't .
they were simply interested in crushing our government , just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the eurozone .
and because they did n't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in greece .
we lost one-third of our nominal gdp .
this is worse than the great depression .
`` and no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say , `` '' this was a colossal mistake . '' '' bg : despite all this , and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion , you seem to be remaining quite pro-european . ''
yv : absolutely .
look , my criticism of the european union and the eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes europe .
my greatest fear is that the eurozone will not survive .
because if it does n't , the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic , and they will destroy the european union .
and that will be catastrophic not just for europe but for the whole global economy .
we are probably the largest economy in the world .
and if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930 's , which seems to me to be what we are doing , then that will be detrimental to the future of europeans and non-europeans alike .
yv : thank you .

gabriel garcía márquez is one of my favorite writers , for his storytelling , but even more , i think , for the beauty and precision of his prose .
`` and whether it 's the opening line from `` '' one hundred years of solitude '' '' or the fantastical stream of consciousness in `` '' autumn of the patriarch , '' '' where the words rush by , page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal south american jungle , reading márquez is a visceral experience . ''
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation .
now i was a comparative literature major in college , which is like an english major , only instead of being stuck studying chaucer for three months , we got to read great literature in translation from around the world .
and as great as these books were , you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .
but not so with márquez who once praised his translator 's versions as being better than his own , which is an astonishing compliment .
so when i heard that the translator , gregory rabassa , had written his own book on the subject , i could n't wait to read it .
`` it 's called apropos of the italian adage that i lifted from his forward , `` if this be treason . '' ''
and it 's a charming read .
it 's highly recommended for anyone who 's interested in the translator 's art .
`` but the reason that i mention it is that early on , rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight : `` '' every act of communication is an act of translation . '' '' now maybe that 's been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i 'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light . ''
ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things , communication has been my central passion .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
so no ego problems .
`` it 's funny , my wife , daisy , whose family is littered with schizophrenics — and i mean littered with them — once said to me , `` '' chris , i already have a brother who thinks he 's god . ''
`` i do n't need a husband who wants to be . '' '' ( laughter ) anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in . ''
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
`` interestingly , when your opening line of communication is , `` '' hey , listen up , because i 'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you , '' '' it 's amazing how quickly you 'll discover both ice and the firing squad . ''
finally , after about 10 years of alienating friends and strangers alike , i finally got it , a new personal truth all my own , that if i was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was gaining , i 'd better find a different way of going about it .
and that 's when i discovered comedy .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum , i 'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies .
and i 'm not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there 's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives — comedy as the philosopher 's stone .
it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world .
because that 's what i take from the theme of this conference : gained in translation .
that it 's about communication that does n't just produce greater understanding within the individual , but leads to real change .
which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self-interest .
now i 'm big on speaking to people 's self-interest because we 're all wired for that .
it 's part of our survival package , and that 's why it 's become so important for us , and that 's why we 're always listening at that level .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self-interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
now as to what i mean by the best comedy and satire , i mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity .
now if you think back on tina fey 's impersonations on saturday night live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate sarah palin , they were devastating .
fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate 's fundamental lack of seriousness , cementing an impression that the majority of the american public still holds today .
and the key detail of this is that fey 's scripts were n't written by her and they were n't written by the snl writers .
they were lifted verbatim from palin 's own remarks .
( laughter ) here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word for word .
now that 's honesty and integrity , and it 's also why fey 's performances left such a lasting impression .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the first time that i heard rush limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful john edwards as the breck girl i knew that he 'd made a direct hit .
now it 's not often that i 'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh , but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline .
the description perfectly captured edwards ' personal vanity .
and guess what ?
that ended up being the exact personality trait that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career .
now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most — ( applause ) ( laughter ) it 's by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy .
survey after survey , from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy , has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows .
( applause ) now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart 's viewers , the larger point remains that stewart 's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts — not because his intent is to inform . it 's not .
his intent is to be funny .
it just so happens that stewart 's brand of funny does n't work unless the facts are true .
and the result is great comedy that 's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media .
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people 's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
a great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick , where you think it 's going over here and then all of a sudden you 're transported over here .
and there 's this mental delight that 's followed by the physical response of laughter , which , not coincidentally , releases endorphins in the brain .
and just like that , you 've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight-or-fight responses , operate .
flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
and the comedy comes along , dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest — race , religion , politics , sexuality — only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin , we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows , revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view .
now let me give you an example from my act .
i have some material about the so-called radical gay agenda , which starts off by asking , how radical is the gay agenda ?
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
( laughter ) three things i 've tried to avoid my entire life . ( laughter )
have at it you radical bastards . the field is yours . ( laughter )
and that 's followed by these lines about gay adoption : what is the problem with gay adoption ?
why is this remotely controversial ?
if you have a baby and you think that baby 's gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
( laughter ) you have given birth to an abomination .
remove it from your household .
`` now by taking the biblical epithet `` '' abomination '' '' and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence , a baby , this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity , through their laughter , to question its validity . ''
misdirection is n't the only trick that comedy has up its sleeve .
economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
`` bill hicks — and if you do n't know his work , you should really google him — hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground , where finally the other kid says to him , `` huh ? well my dad can beat up your dad , '' to which hicks replies , `` really ? how soon ? '' ''
( laughter ) that 's an entire childhood in three words . ( laughter )
not to mention what it reveals about the adult who 's speaking them .
and one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it 's inherently viral .
people ca n't wait to pass along that new great joke .
and this is n't some new phenomenon of our wired world .
comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the internet , social media , even cable tv .
back in 1980 when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident , i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d.c. two days after that .
and i heard the exact same punchline on both coasts — something about the ignited negro college fund .
clearly , it did n't come out of a tonight show monologue .
and my guess here — and i have no research on this — is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it , you 'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession .
first there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
( laughter ) but it 's when you put all of these elements together — when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that 's crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
now i have a close friend , joel pett , who 's the editorial cartoonist for the lexington herald-leader .
and he used to be the usa today monday morning guy .
i was visiting with joel the weekend before the copenhagen conference on climate change opened in december of 2009 .
and joel was explaining to me that , because usa today was one of america 's four papers of record , it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference , which meant that , if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on monday , the opening day of the conference , it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision-makers .
so we started talking about climate change .
and it turned out that joel and i were both bothered by the same thing , which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or was n't , which , to both of us , seems somewhat intentionally off point .
because first of all , there 's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists .
now governor perry of my newly-adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the republican presidential nomination , proclaiming over and over that the science was n't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of texas were on fire .
and perry 's policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain .
personally , i was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science .
( laughter ) but back in 2009 , the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science .
so we tossed it back and forth until joel came up with this .
`` cartoon : `` '' what if it 's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? '' '' ( laughter ) you 've got to love that idea . ''
( applause ) how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ?
not for god , not for country , not for profit — just as a basic metric for global decision-making .
and this cartoon hit the bull 's eye .
shortly after the conference was over , joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the epa in washington whose wall it now hangs on .
and not long after that , he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year .
and it did n't stop there .
to date , joel 's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups , in the united states , canada and europe .
and earlier this year , he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world .
( applause ) that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
so my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny , because you might just find the question that you 've been looking for .
thank you .
( applause )
hi , my name is frank , and i collect secrets .
it all started with a crazy idea in november of 2004 .
i printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
they were blank on one side , and on the other side i listed some simple instructions .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before .
and i handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of washington , d.c. , not knowing what to expect .
but soon the idea began spreading virally .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
i started receiving secrets in my home mailbox , not just with postmarks from washington , d.c. , but from texas , california , vancouver , new zealand , iraq .
soon my crazy idea did n't seem so crazy .
postsecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
and this is my postcard collection today .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
`` `` '' i found these stamps as a child , and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to . ''
`` i never did have someone . '' '' secrets can take many forms . ''
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet .
( laughter ) maybe one of you sent this one in .
i do n't know .
this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard .
this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side .
`` `` '' dear birthmother , i have great parents . ''
`` i 've found love . i 'm happy . '' '' secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now . ''
`` `` '' everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes i 'm dead . '' '' `` `` i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i did n't wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . '' '' ( laughter ) this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you . ''
i love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
and sometimes afterwards i 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
and i should also mention that , just like today , at that postsecret event , i was using a wireless microphone .
`` `` '' your mic was n't off during sound check . ''
`` we all heard you pee . '' '' ( laughter ) this was really embarrassing when it happened , until i realized it could have been worse . ''
right . you know what i 'm saying .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i did n't use . ''
`` i feel like the happiest person on earth ( now . ) '' '' `` `` one of these men is the father of my son . ''
`` he pays me a lot to keep it a secret . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' that saturday when you wondered where i was , well , i was getting your ring . ''
`` it 's in my pocket right now . '' '' i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day . ''
it was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
and it had n't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
`` and he said , `` '' frank , i 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . '' '' he said , `` '' my knees are still shaking . '' '' he said , `` '' for three years , my girlfriend and i , we 've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud . ''
`` i read some to her , she reads some to me . '' '' he says , `` '' it 's really brought us closer together through the years . ''
and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom , i was beside myself .
and i tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
`` and just like every sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . '' '' he said , `` '' but this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . '' '' but she finally did . ''
she got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
`` and he said , `` '' she read it once and then she read it again . '' '' and she turned to him and said , `` is that our cat ? '' ''
( laughter ) and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending .
`` so i emailed him back and i said , `` '' please share with me an image , something , that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . '' '' and he emailed me this picture . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer . ''
`` i finally got the pictures developed and i 'd love to give them to you . '' '' this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it , but this secret has impacted many lives , starting with a student up in canada named matty . ''
matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called ifoundyourcamera .
matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they 've found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
this one 's my favorite .
( laughter ) matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
and it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge .
matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
`` `` '' that 's me , my husband and son . ''
the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
thank you for making your site .
these pictures mean more to me than you know .
my son 's birth is on this camera .
`` he turns four tomorrow . '' '' every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it — sometimes crossing oceans , sometimes going through language barriers . ''
this is the last postcard i have to share with you today .
`` `` '' when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . '' '' when i posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died . ''
they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
secrets can take many forms .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet again .
voicemail recording : first saved voice message .
grandma : ♫ it 's somebody 's birthday today ♫ ♫ somebody 's birthday today ♫ ♫ the candles are lighted ♫ ♫ on somebody 's cake ♫ ♫ and we 're all invited ♫ ♫ for somebody 's sake ♫ you 're 21 years old today .
have a real happy birthday , and i love you .
i 'll say bye for now .
fw : thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
june cohen : frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret ?
fw : i have one of my own secrets in every book .
i think in some ways , the reason i started the project , even though i did n't know it at the time , was because i was struggling with my own secrets .
and it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
jc : and has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book ?
has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
fw : sometimes i share that information , yeah .
( laughter ) ( applause )
when i was 14 years old , i was interested in science — fascinated by it , excited to learn about it .
`` and i had a high school science teacher who would say to the class , `` the girls do n't have to listen to this . '' ''
encouraging , yes .
( laughter ) i chose not to listen — but to that statement alone .
so let me take you to the andes mountains in chile , 500 kilometers , 300 miles northeast of santiago .
it 's very remote , it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful .
and there 's not much there .
there are condors , there are tarantulas , and at night , when the light dims , it reveals one of the darkest skies on earth .
it 's kind of a magic place , the mountain .
it 's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology .
and our ancestors , for as long as there 's been recorded history , have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence .
and we 're no exception , our generation .
the only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights .
and so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos .
so telescopes are our window to the cosmos .
it 's no exaggeration to say that the southern hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century .
we have an array of existing telescopes already , in the andes mountains in chile , and that 's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability .
there will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes , sensitive to optical radiation , as our eyes are .
there will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights .
there will be radio telescopes , sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation .
and then there will be telescopes in space .
there 'll be a successor to the hubble space telescope ; it 's called the james webb telescope , and it will be launched in 2018 .
there 'll be a satellite called tess that will discover planets outside of our solar system .
for the last decade , i 've been leading a group — a consortium — international group , to build what will be , when it 's finished , the largest optical telescope in existence .
it 's called the giant magellan telescope , or gmt .
this telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter — each of the mirrors .
that 's almost 27 feet .
so it dwarfs this stage — maybe out to the fourth row in this audience .
each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost 27 feet in diameter .
together , the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter .
so , essentially the size of this entire auditorium .
the whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high , and again , being in rio , some of you have been to see the statue of the giant christ .
the scale is comparable in height ; in fact , it 's smaller than this telescope will be .
it 's comparable to the size of the statue of liberty .
and it 's going to be housed in an enclosure that 's 22 stories — 60 meters high .
but it 's an unusual building to protect this telescope .
it will have open windows to the sky , be able to point and look at the sky , and it will actually rotate on a base — 2,000 tons of rotating building .
the giant magellan telescope will have 10 times the resolution of the hubble space telescope .
it will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye .
and it may , for the first time ever , be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system .
it 's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe — literally , the dawn of the cosmos .
the cosmic dawn .
it 's a telescope that 's going to allow us to peer back , witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling , the first black holes in the universe , the first galaxies .
now , for thousands of years , we have been studying the cosmos , we 've been wondering about our place in the universe .
the ancient greeks told us that the earth was the center of the universe .
five hundred years ago , copernicus displaced the earth , and put the sun at the heart of the cosmos .
and as we 've learned over the centuries , since galileo galilei , the italian scientist , first turned , in that time , a two-inch , very small telescope , to the sky , every time we have built larger telescopes , we have learned something about the universe ; we 've made discoveries , without exception .
we 've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion .
we know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies that are visible to us , and each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it .
so we 're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that 's ever been taken .
it was taken using the hubble space telescope , and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky , before the launch of hubble .
and if you can imagine this tiny area , it 's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon .
so , if you can imagine the full moon .
and there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image .
and the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away , the vast distances .
and each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars .
telescopes are like time machines .
so the farther back we look in space , the further back we see in time .
and they 're like light buckets — literally , they collect light .
so larger the bucket , the larger the mirror we have , the more light we can see , and the farther back we can view .
so , we 've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe — black holes .
we 've even learned that there 's dark matter and dark energy that we ca n't see .
so you 're looking now at an actual image of dark matter .
( laughter ) you got it . not all audiences get that . ( laughter )
so the way we infer the presence of dark matter — we ca n't see it — but there 's an unmistakable tug , due to gravity .
we now can look out , we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that 's expanding .
what i do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe , and one of the projects that i carried out in the 1990s used the hubble space telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding .
we can now trace back to 14 billion years .
we 've learned over time that stars have individual histories ; that is , they have birth , they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths .
so the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see , most of which turn out to have planets going around them .
and one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars .
these are called exoplanets .
and until 1995 , we did n't even know the existence of any other planets , other than going around our own sun .
but now , there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect , measure masses for .
there are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems .
and there are 4,000 — and still counting — other candidates for planets orbiting other stars .
they come in a bewildering variety of different kinds .
`` there are jupiter-like planets that are hot , there are other planets that are icy , there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the earth , so-called `` '' super-earths , '' '' and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds . ''
so we know there 's at least one planet , our own earth , in which there is life .
we 've even found planets that are orbiting two stars .
that 's no longer the province of science fiction .
so around our own planet , we know there 's life , we 've developed a complex life , we now can question our own origins .
and given all that we 've discovered , the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions , perhaps — maybe even hundreds of millions — of other [ planets ] that are close enough — just the right distance from their stars that they 're orbiting — to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life .
so we marvel now at those odds , the overwhelming odds , and the amazing thing is that within the next decade , the gmt may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets , and determine whether or not they have the potential for life .
so , what is the gmt project ?
it 's an international project .
it includes australia , south korea , and i 'm happy to say , being here in rio , that the newest partner in our telescope is brazil .
( applause ) it also includes a number of institutions across the united states , including harvard university , the smithsonian and the carnegie institutions , and the universities of arizona , chicago , texas-austin and texas a & m university .
it also involves chile .
take chunks of glass , melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating .
this happens underneath the football stadium at the university of arizona .
it 's tucked away under 52,000 seats .
nobody know it 's happening .
and there 's essentially a rotating cauldron .
the mirrors are cast and they 're cooled very slowly , and then they 're polished to an exquisite precision .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
so , can you visualize that ?
ow !
( laughter ) that 's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs , over this entire 27 feet .
it 's a spectacular achievement .
it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have .
so , what does that precision buy us ?
so the gmt , if you can imagine — if i were to hold up a coin , which i just happen to have , and i look at the face of that coin , i can see from here the writing on the coin ; i can see the face on that coin .
my guess that even in the front row , you ca n't see that .
but if we were to turn the giant magellan telescope , all 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium , and point it 200 miles away , if i were standing in são paulo , we could resolve the face of this coin .
that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope .
and if we were — ( applause ) if an astronaut went up to the moon , a quarter of a million miles away , and lit a candle — a single candle — then we would be able to detect it , using the gmt .
quite extraordinary .
this is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy .
`` `` '' nearby '' '' is astronomical , it 's all relative . ''
it 's tens of millions of light-years away .
this is what this cluster would look like .
so look at those four bright objects , and now lets compare it with a camera on the hubble space telescope .
you can see faint detail that starts to come through .
and now finally — and look how dramatic this is — this is what the gmt will see .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
this is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the earth , and this , again , what the gmt will see .
extraordinary precision .
so , where are we ?
we have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in chile .
we blasted that off .
we 've tested and polished the first mirror .
we 've cast the second and the third mirrors .
and we 're about to cast the fourth mirror .
`` we had a series of reviews this year , international panels that came in and reviewed us , and said , `` '' you 're ready to go to construction . '' '' and so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors . ''
`` we want to get on the air quickly , and be taking science data — what we astronomers call `` '' first light , '' '' in 2021 . ''
and the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade , with all seven mirrors .
so we 're now poised to look back at the distant universe , the cosmic dawn .
we 'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail .
but for me , one of the most exciting things about building the gmt is the opportunity to actually discover something that we do n't know about — that we ca n't even imagine at this point , something completely new .
and my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities , that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars .
thank you very much .
obrigado .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thank you , wendy .
stay with me , because i have a question for you .
you mentioned different facilities .
so the magellan telescope is going up , but also alma and others in chile and elsewhere , including in hawaii .
is it about cooperation and complementarity , or about competition ?
i know there 's competition in terms of funding , but what about the science ?
wendy freedman : in terms of the science , they 're very complementary .
so when we discover other planets , we 'll be able to test those observations , we 'll be able to measure the atmospheres , be able to look in space with very high resolution .
so , they 're very complementary .
you 're right about the funding , we compete ; but scientifically , it 's very complementary .
bg : wendy , thank you very much for coming to tedglobal .
wf : thank you .
( applause )
so , this is an astounding table .
because this is wrong .
so , what is cancer , first of all ?
so , as an aside , i firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early .
it is the only way you can start to fight cancer , is by catching it early .
you know , the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease .
so the diseases we have today , which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this .
each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified .
it was in her brain , in her lungs , in her liver .
that cancer recurred , and she passed away three years later from lung cancer , but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne .
you do n't need to shrink the disease .
would it have been 10 centimeters , or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost ?
and , again , that 's where these new technologies can come in .
now this is a very un-ted-like thing to do , but let 's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor .
anonymous : dear fox news , it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of anonymous has been ravaged .
we are everyone . we are no one .
we are anonymous . we are legion .
we do not forgive . we do not forget .
we are but the base of chaos .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen — a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011 .
and they 're pretty scary .
you never know when they 're going to attack next , who or what the consequences will be .
but interestingly , they have a sense of humor .
these guys hacked into fox news ' twitter account to announce president obama 's assassination .
now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at fox .
`` `` '' what do we do now ? ''
`` put on a black armband , or crack open the champagne ? '' '' ( laughter ) and of course , who could escape the irony of a member of rupert murdoch 's news corp . ''
being a victim of hacking for a change .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) sometimes you turn on the news and you say , `` '' is there anyone left to hack ? '' '' sony playstation network — done , the government of turkey — tick , britain 's serious organized crime agency — a breeze , the cia — falling off a log . ''
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they 've been hacked , and those that do n't .
i mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the fbi have been hacked .
is nothing sacred anymore , for heaven 's sake ?
anyway , this mysterious group anonymous — and they would say this themselves — they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data .
but there is also a very serious aspect to anonymous — they are ideologically driven .
they claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy .
they say that governments are trying to take over the internet and control it , and that they , anonymous , are the authentic voice of resistance — be it against middle eastern dictatorships , against global media corporations , or against intelligence agencies , or whoever it is .
and their politics are not entirely unattractive .
okay , they 're a little inchoate .
there 's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them .
but one thing is true : we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the internet .
the web links everything , and very soon it will mediate most human activity .
because the internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom .
now this is a very complicated struggle .
and unfortunately , for mortals like you and me , we probably ca n't understand it very well .
nonetheless , in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago , i decided i would try and do that .
and i sort of get it .
these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it .
but in order to try and explain the whole thing , i would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you 're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even stephen hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around .
so there you are .
and as you see , in the middle , there is our old friend , the hacker .
the hacker is absolutely central to many of the political , social and economic issues affecting the net .
`` and so i thought to myself , `` well , these are the guys who i want to talk to . '' ''
and what do you know , nobody else does talk to the hackers .
they 're completely anonymous , as it were .
so despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions , hundreds of billions of dollars , into cybersecurity — for the most extraordinary technical solutions — no one wants to talk to these guys , the hackers , who are doing everything .
instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
well , i say nothing , but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in turin , italy called the hackers profiling project .
and they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics , into the abilities and the socialization of hackers .
but because they 're a u.n. operation , maybe that 's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them .
because it 's a u.n. operation , of course , it lacks funding .
but i think they 're doing very important work .
because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry , we have a definite lack of — call me old-fashioned — human intelligence .
now , so far i 've mentioned the hackers anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group .
of course , the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals .
but interestingly , anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
but what about the real cybercriminals ?
well real organized crime on the internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime .
welcome to the now forgotten realm of carderplanet .
this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the net .
now carderplanet was very interesting .
cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details , to exchange information about new malware that was out there .
and remember , this is a time when we 're seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware .
this is ready for use , out-of-the-box stuff , which you can deploy even if you 're not a terribly sophisticated hacker .
and so carderplanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals .
and its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial , because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they 're a criminal ?
( laughter ) it 's axiomatic that they 're dodgy , and they 're going to want to try and rip you off .
so the family , as the inner core of carderplanet was known , came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system .
they appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser .
the vendor , say , had stolen credit card details ; the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them .
the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally , and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .
and the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked .
and if they did , he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser .
and it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the web .
and after that , it just went wild .
we had a champagne decade for people who we know as carders .
now i spoke to one of these carders who we 'll call redbrigade — although that was n't even his proper nickname — but i promised i would n't reveal who he was .
and he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an atm here , $ 30,000 from an atm there , using cloned credit cards .
he was making , on average a week , $ 150,000 — tax free of course .
and he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-east side apartment at one point that he just did n't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression .
but that 's a slightly different story , which i wo n't go into now .
now the interesting thing about redbrigade is that he was n't an advanced hacker .
he sort of understood the technology , and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a carder , but he did n't spend his days and nights bent over a computer , eating pizza , drinking coke and that sort of thing .
he was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life .
and this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise .
and often they 're the most vulnerable element of all .
and i want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who i met while i was doing this research .
dimitry golubov , aka script — born in odessa , ukraine in 1982 .
now he developed his social and moral compass on the black sea port during the 1990s .
this was a sink-or-swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive .
as an accomplished computer user , what dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the worldwide web .
and he did a great job in it .
you have to understand though that from his ninth birthday , the only environment he knew was gangsterism .
he knew no other way of making a living and making money .
then we have renukanth subramaniam , aka jilsi — founder of darkmarket , born in colombo , sri lanka .
as an eight year-old , he and his parents fled the sri lankan capital because singhalese mobs were roaming the city , looking for tamils like renu to murder .
at 11 , he was interrogated by the sri lankan military , accused of being a terrorist , and his parents sent him on his own to britain as a refugee seeking political asylum .
at 13 , with only little english and being bullied at school , he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability , but he was soon being seduced by people on the internet .
he was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud , and he will be released from wormwood scrubs jail in london in 2012 .
matrix001 , who was an administrator at darkmarket .
born in southern germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family , his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking .
and he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
and when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications , he was already in too deep .
max vision , aka iceman — mastermind of cardersmarket .
born in meridian , idaho .
max vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of santa clara , california in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the fbi .
now in the late 1990s , he discovered a vulnerability on all u.s. government networks , and he went in and patched it up — because this included nuclear research facilities — sparing the american government a huge security embarrassment .
but also , because he was an inveterate hacker , he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl .
but this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator , and he was convicted .
at his open prison , he came under the influence of financial fraudsters , and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release .
and this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in california .
adewale taiwo , aka freddybb — master bank account cracker from abuja in nigeria .
he set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup , bankfrauds @ yahoo.co.uk before arriving in britain in 2005 to take a masters in chemical engineering at manchester university .
he impressed in the private sector , developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008 .
and then finally , cagatay evyapan , aka cha0 — one of the most remarkable hackers ever , from ankara in turkey .
he combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal .
one of the smartest people i 've ever met .
he also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals .
now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments .
they are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens . they are all people
who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences .
remember that , when they developed those hacking skills , their moral compass had not yet developed .
and most of them , with the exception of script and cha0 , they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world — only on the web .
and the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with asperger 's syndrome .
now i discussed this with professor simon baron-cohen who 's the professor of developmental psychopathology at cambridge .
and he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed , also for the authorities here , that gary mckinnon — who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon — suffers from asperger 's and a secondary condition of depression .
and baron-cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills , and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped .
now i think we 're missing a trick here , because i do n't think people like max vision should be in jail .
and let me be blunt about this .
in china , in russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities , this is exactly what they are doing .
they are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities — are mobilizing them on behalf of the state .
we need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people , because they are a remarkable breed .
and if we rely , as we do at the moment , solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences , we will be nurturing a monster we can not tame .
thank you very much for listening .
( applause ) chris anderson : so your idea worth spreading is hire hackers .
how would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole ?
mg : i think to an extent , you have to understand that it 's axiomatic among hackers that they do that .
they 're just relentless and obsessive about what they do .
`` but all of the people who i 've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law , they have all said , `` '' please , please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry . ''
we just never knew how to get there , what we were doing .
`` we want to work with you . '' '' chris anderson : okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot misha . ''
( applause )
after all , take a look at these events : imperialism and colonization , world wars , george w. bush .
ask yourself , who 's responsible ? adults .
now , what have kids done ?
well , anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust .
ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the united states .
now , if you do n't trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?
now , what 's even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids ' abilities .
thank you , bill gates , and thank you , ma .
instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published , or saying wait until you 're older , my parents were really supportive .
one large children 's publisher ironically said that they did n't work with children .
kids grow up and become adults just like you .
it 's the reason we 're not in the dark ages anymore .
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
( applause ) thank you . thank you .
so i 'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important , long , oily , hot summer , and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted .
but before i talk about the political chemistry , i actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil .
this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in 2002 to watch the minerals management service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .
and what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil , you see some ice cubes , and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm .
the napalm is burning there quite nicely .
and the thing is , is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer .
we 're four percent of the world 's population ; we use 25 percent of the world 's oil production .
and we do n't really understand what oil is , until you check out its molecules , and you do n't really understand that until you see this stuff burn .
so this is what happens as that burn gets going .
it takes off . it 's a big woosh .
i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again .
it 'll just bake your retinas .
so there it is ; the retinas are baking .
let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .
oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen — that 's methane — it just floats off .
then there 's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon .
you 've probably heard of benzene rings ; they 're very carcinogenic .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thick , galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons , and they have thousands of hydrogens , and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them .
those are called the asphaltenes ; they 're an ingredient in asphalt .
they 're very important in oil spills .
let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water .
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
oil does n't sink , it floats .
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
it spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it .
the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
and then the asphaltenes — and this is the crucial thing — the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion , something like mayonnaise .
it triples the amount of oily , messy goo that you have in the water , and it makes it very hard to handle .
it also makes it very viscous .
when the prestige sank off the coast of spain , there were big , floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil , with the consistency , or the viscosity , of chewing gum .
it 's incredibly hard to clean up .
and every single oil is different when it hits water .
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it 's absolutely explosive .
for the first time , american consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves .
`` they have a `` '' eureka ! '' '' moment , when we suddenly understand oil in a different context . ''
so i 'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics , because it 's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important , why we need to stay focused .
`` nobody gets up in the morning and thinks , `` '' wow ! i 'm going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work . '' '' no , they think , `` '' ugh . i have to go buy gas . ''
i 'm so angry about it . the oil companies are ripping me off .
they set the prices , and i do n't even know .
`` i am helpless over this . '' '' and this is what happens to us at the gas pump — and actually , gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger . ''
you might notice that many gas pumps , including this one , are designed to look like atms .
i 've talked to engineers . that 's specifically to diffuse our anger , because supposedly we feel good about atms .
( laughter ) that shows you how bad it is .
but actually , i mean , this feeling of helplessness comes in because most americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy , not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market .
and the thing is , too , is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume , which is somewhat reasonable , because in fact , we have designed this system where , if you want to get a job , it 's much more important to have a car that runs , to have a job and keep a job , than to have a ged .
and that 's actually very perverse .
now there 's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas , which is that we 'd rather be doing anything else .
this is bp 's gas station in downtown los angeles .
it is green . it is a shrine to greenishness .
`` `` '' now , '' '' you think , `` '' why would something so lame work on people so smart ? '' '' well , the reason is , is because , when we 're buying gas , we 're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance . ''
i mean , we 're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else .
we do n't want to be buying oil ; we want to be doing something green .
and we get kind of in on our own con .
i mean — and this is funny , it looks funny here .
`` but in fact , that 's why the slogan `` '' beyond petroleum '' '' worked . ''
but it 's an inherent part of our energy policy , which is we do n't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use .
we talk about energy independence . we talk about hydrogen cars .
we talk about biofuels that have n't been invented yet .
and so , cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil , and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
the oil industry is like a huge , gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms .
this is an early-on photograph — you can see , we had these gushers .
`` early journalists looked at these spills , and they said , `` '' this is a filthy industry . '' '' but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing . ''
they were n't farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .
`` it 's the `` '' beverly hillbillies , '' '' basically . ''
but in the beginning , this was seen as a very morally problematic thing , long before it became funny .
and then , of course , there was john d. rockefeller .
and the thing about john d. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry , and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company , a multinational .
it was terrifying ; you think walmart is a terrifying business model now , imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s .
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy .
but what 's really amazing is that ida tarbell , the journalist , went in and did a big exposé of rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place .
but in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
`` and here 's one of the things that ida tarbell said — she said , `` '' he has a thin nose like a thorn . ''
there were no lips .
`` there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them . '' '' ( laughter ) okay , so that guy is actually still with us . ( laughter ) ''
i mean , this is a very pervasive — this is part of our dna .
and then there 's this guy , okay .
so , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these ceos down to washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
`` and this is something that we 've been doing since 1974 , when we first asked them , `` '' why are there these obscene profits ? '' '' and we 've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these ceos . ''
and we take it as , you know — we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
and so i 'm not saying these guys are n't liable to answer questions — i 'm just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you do n't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you 're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil .
so i 'm saying this is kind of a distraction .
but it makes for good theater , and it 's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week .
so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .
i mean , these pictures — this is from the santa barbara spill .
you have these pictures of birds .
they really influence people .
when the santa barbara spill happened in 1969 , it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .
it started earth day .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
i think it 's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us .
here we are normally ; we 're standing at the gas pump , and we 're feeling kind of helpless .
we look at these pictures and we understand , for the first time , our role in this supply chain .
we connect the dots in the supply chain .
`` and we have this kind of — as voters , we have kind of a `` '' eureka ! '' '' moment . ''
this is why these moments of these oil spills are so important .
but it 's also really important that we do n't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it .
we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem .
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .
we were very reactive , as opposed to being proactive about what happened .
and so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling .
we stopped drilling in anwr , but we did n't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed .
in fact , it 's continued to increase .
the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
as you can see , our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out .
we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the persian gulf .
one of the things that 's happened because of this is that , since 1969 , the country of nigeria , or the part of nigeria that pumps oil , which is the delta — which is two times the size of maryland — has had thousands of oil spills a year .
i mean , we 've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .
that has been the equivalent of an exxon valdez spill every year since 1969 .
and we can wrap our heads around the spills , because that 's what we see here , but in fact , these guys actually live in a war zone .
there 's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of maryland , and it 's all related to the oil .
and these guys , i mean , if they were in the u.s. , they might be actually here in this room .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business — they 're entrepreneurs . they do n't actually want to be doing what they 're doing .
and it 's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .
the other thing that we 've done , as we 've continued to increase demand , is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs .
one of the places we put in a big oil project in chad , with exxon .
so the u.s. taxpayer paid for it ; the world bank , exxon paid for it .
we put it in . there was a tremendous banditry problem .
i was there in 2003 .
`` we were driving along this dark , dark road , and the guy in the green stepped out , and i was just like , `` '' ahhh ! this is it . '' '' and then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out , and we realized it was okay . ''
they have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields .
but at the same time , chad has become much more unstable , and we are not paying for that price at the pump .
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
we do the same thing with the price of policing the persian gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open .
this is 1988 — we actually bombed two iranian oil platforms that year .
that was the beginning of an escalating u.s. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump .
we pay for it on april 15th , and we ca n't even calculate the cost of this involvement .
the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico , which was not part of the moratoriums .
now what 's happened in the gulf of mexico — as you can see , this is the minerals management diagram of wells for gas and oil .
it 's become this intense industrialized zone .
it does n't have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has , but it should , i mean , it 's a bird sanctuary .
also , every time you buy gasoline in the united states , half of it is actually being refined along the coast , because the gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well .
so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .
and finally , american families also pay a price for oil .
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car .
if you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really commute .
they 're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care .
and the same thing happens at the 50th percentile , around 80,000 .
gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy , but they 're also a drain on individual families and it 's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher .
so , what i 'm going to talk to you about now is : what do we have to do this time ?
what are the laws ? what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ?
one thing is — we need to stay away from the theater .
we need to stay away from the moratoriums .
we need to focus really back again on the molecules .
the moratoriums are fine , but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil .
one of the things that we also need to do , is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world , before you reduce the amount of oil that we use .
we need to focus on reducing the oil .
what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u.s. economy .
it comes in on the side — the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un-useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy — the waste , goes up to the top .
now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount .
and one of the things that we need to do is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient , but we also need to fix the economy in general .
we need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
for example , we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000 .
we actually encourage people to drive more .
we have policies that reward sprawl — we have all kinds of policies .
we need to have more mobility choices .
we need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil .
and we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry , which is at least 10 billion dollars a year , into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute .
whether that 's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road , this is where we need to be .
we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing , and you can find more about this policy .
`` it 's called strong , which is `` '' secure transportation reducing oil needs gradually , '' '' and the idea is instead of being helpless , we need to be more strong . ''
they 're up at newamerica.net .
what 's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump , to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are , having kind of that special moment , where we connect the dots actually at the pump .
now supposedly , oil taxes are the third rail of american politics — the no-fly zone .
i actually — i agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much , but i think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline , and upped it to six cents next year , nine cents the following year , all the way up to 30 cents by 2020 , that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption , and at the same time we would give people time to prepare , time to respond , and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time .
let me give you a little sense of how this would work .
this is a gas receipt , hypothetically , for a year from now .
the first thing that you have on the tax is — you have a tax for a stronger america — 33 cents .
so you 're not helpless at the pump .
and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign , very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack .
`` and what it says is , `` '' the national academy of sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates 29 cents in health care costs . '' '' that 's a lot . ''
and so this — you can see that you 're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .
and also , the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system .
and at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you 're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .
with this whole sort of suite of policies , we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption — or our oil consumption — by 20 percent by 2020 .
so , three million barrels a day .
but in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon .
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .
thank you .

`` dr. martin luther king , jr. , in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement , states , `` '' in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . '' '' as a teacher , i 've internalized this message . ''
every day , all around us , we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination , violence , genocide and war .
in the classroom , i challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry .
we work together to fill those spaces , to recognize them , to name them , to understand that they do n't have to be sources of shame .
in an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences , i have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class , which every student signs at the beginning of the year : read critically , write consciously , speak clearly , tell your truth .
and i find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your truth .
and i realized that if i was going to ask my students to speak up , i was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where i failed to do so .
so i tell them that growing up , as a kid in a catholic family in new orleans , during lent i was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up , sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to god you understand his sanctity .
i 've given up soda , mcdonald 's , french fries , french kisses , and everything in between .
but one year , i gave up speaking .
i figured the most valuable thing i could sacrifice was my own voice , but it was like i had n't realized that i had given that up a long time ago .
i spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to , told myself i was n't meant to be anyone 's conscience because i still had to figure out being my own , so sometimes i just would n't say anything , appeasing ignorance with my silence , unaware that validation does n't need words to endorse its existence .
when christian was beat up for being gay , i put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if i did n't even notice .
i could n't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one i had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing .
i was more concerned with touching the screen on my apple than actually feeding him one .
`` when the woman at the fundraising gala said `` '' i 'm so proud of you . ''
`` it must be so hard teaching those poor , unintelligent kids , '' '' i bit my lip , because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity . ''
we spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they do n't .
silence is the residue of fear .
it is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
it is the air retreating from your chest because it does n't feel safe in your lungs .
silence is rwandan genocide . silence is katrina .
it is what you hear when there are n't enough body bags left .
it is the sound after the noose is already tied .
it is charring . it is chains . it is privilege . it is pain .
there is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you .
i will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
i will tell christian that he is a lion , a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance .
i will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was , because sometimes all people want to be is human .
`` i will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was thoreau , and just because you watched one episode of `` '' the wire '' '' does n't mean you know anything about my kids . ''
so this year , instead of giving something up , i will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue , a stage on the underside of my inhibition .
because who has to have a soapbox when all you 've ever needed is your voice ?
thank you .

i think it 's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives .
but what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death ?
what would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you ?
in my husband 's homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia , there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process .
in tana toraja , the most important social moments in people 's lives , the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners , but funerals .
so these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals — pigs , chickens and , most importantly , water buffalo — that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased .
so this cultural complex surrounding death , the ritual enactment of the end of life , has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of toraja 's landscape .
lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks , funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair , where commemorating someone who 's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition .
and it 's a transition that 's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead .
so every year , thousands of visitors come to tana toraja to see , as it were , this culture of death , and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the west .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it 's not experienced the same way the world over .
and as an anthropologist , i see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us .
so where we see an unquestionable reality , death as an irrefutable biological condition , torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis .
so again , the physical cessation of life is not the same as death .
in fact , a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone 's participation .
so after a person 's physical death , their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence , which is called the tongkonan .
and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death .
so essentially , the shape of the building that you 're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
`` until the funeral ceremony , which can be held years after a person 's physical death , the deceased is referred to as `` '' to makala , '' '' a sick person , or `` '' to mama , '' '' a person who is asleep , and they continue to be a member of the household . ''
they are symbolically fed and cared for , and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions , which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as puya .
so i know what some of you must be thinking right now .
is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives ?
and that 's exactly what i 'm saying .
but instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies , proximity to death , or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death , i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out .
i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , does n't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there 's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
so torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship , the human body .
so my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather , and for him there is nothing unnatural about this .
this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased , and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who 's living to relating to the deceased as a person who 's an ancestor .
and here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors , so these are people who have already been buried , already had a funeral ceremony .
these are called tau tau .
so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death .
it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities .
and it 's also a moment of self-awareness .
it 's a moment when people think about who they are , their place in society , and their role in the life cycle in accordance with torajan cosmology .
there 's a saying in toraja that all people will become grandparents , and what this means is that after death , we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future .
so essentially , we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us .
and this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people 's soul from here to the afterlife , and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them .
but the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased , and , by extension , the deceased 's family .
so at funerals , relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place : its impact on life and the relationships of the living .
so all of this focus on death does n't mean that torajans do n't aspire to the ideal of a long life .
they engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age .
but they do n't put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age .
it 's said in toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life .
it 's called the sunga ' .
and like a thread , it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end .
so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life , people 's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected .
the patriarch of my husband 's maternal clan , nenet katcha , is now approaching the age of 100 , as far as we can tell .
and there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for puya .
and his death will be greatly mourned .
but i know that my husband 's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can ritually recount his life 's narrative , weaving his story into the history of their community .
his story is their story .
his funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves .
and it 's a story that has no discernible beginning , no foreseeable end .
it 's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does .
people ask me if i 'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn .
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
in reality , the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the u.s. healthcare system , where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us , not just on medicine 's ability to prolong life .
we , like the torajans , base our decisions about life on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death .
so i 'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans .
it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the united states .
but i want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story .
what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it 's so intimately a part of who we all are ?
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the u.s. healthcare system , particularly in the end-of-life care , is as simple as a shift in perspective , and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death .
it might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that 's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death , being afraid of talking about it .
if we could entertain and value other kinds of knowledge about life , including other definitions of death , it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life .
it could change the way that we die , but more importantly , it could transform the way that we live .
