today i 'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
it 's just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
( laughter ) we 'll just — we can just skip — i 'll just skip through the video instead ... ( laughter )
no . ( laughter ) ( laughter )
( music ) this is not ... ( laughter )
okay . ( laughter )
solar technology is ...
oh , that 's all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
( applause )
so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right now .
we 're going to come back to that in a few minutes , and i 'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life unfolds .
so , we 're really fascinated with body language , and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language .
you know , we 're interested in , like , you know — ( laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
narrator : here they are arriving at number 10 .
this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states .
we close up . we wrap ourselves up .
we make ourselves small .
we do n't want to bump into the person next to us .
so again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
and this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals .
so if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . we do n't mirror them .
we do the opposite of them .
i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals .
so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occupy space .
when they sit down , they 're sort of spread out .
they raise their hands like this .
i notice a couple of things about this .
one , you 're not going to be surprised .
it seems to be related to gender .
so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
and this is really important in the mba classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attributable to participation .
so i started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they 're participating .
is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
so we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . there 's a lot of evidence .
but our question really was , do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves ?
so it goes both ways .
when it comes to power , it also goes both ways .
so when you feel powerful , you 're more likely to do this , but it 's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful .
and when i say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am i talking about ?
so i 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that 's hormones . i look at hormones .
so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
when you 're in the low-power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that 's a whopping significant difference .
here 's what we find on testosterone .
from their baseline when they come in , high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase , and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease .
so again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
here 's what you get on cortisol .
high-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease , and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase .
so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and feeling sort of shut down .
and we 've all had the feeling , right ?
so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
also , our bodies change our minds .
but the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
this is in the lab , it 's this little task , it 's just a couple of minutes .
where can you actually apply this ?
which we cared about , of course .
and so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
where are you being evaluated , either by your friends ?
for teenagers , it 's at the lunchroom table .
for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting .
it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through , was the job interview .
so we published these findings , and the media are all over it , and they say , okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
( laughter ) you know , so we were of course horrified , and said , oh my god , no , that 's not what we meant at all .
for numerous reasons , no , do n't do that .
again , this is not about you talking to other people .
it 's you talking to yourself .
what do you do before you go into a job interview ? you do this .
you 're sitting down . you 're looking at your iphone — or your android , not trying to leave anyone out .
you 're looking at your notes , you 're hunching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the bathroom , right ? do that . find two minutes .
so that 's what we want to test . okay ?
so we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview .
it 's five minutes long . they are being recorded .
they 're being judged also , and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback , so they look like this .
so for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
people hate this .
`` it 's what marianne lafrance calls `` '' standing in social quicksand . '' '' so this really spikes your cortisol . ''
so this is the job interview we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
we then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
they 're blind to the hypothesis . they 're blind to the conditions .
`` they have no idea who 's been posing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of tapes , and they say , `` '' we want to hire these people , '' '' all the high-power posers . ''
`` `` '' we do n't want to hire these people . ''
`` we also evaluate these people much more positively overall . '' '' but what 's driving it ? ''
it 's not about the content of the speech .
it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech .
because we rate them on all these variables related to competence , like , how well-structured is the speech ?
how good is it ? what are their qualifications ?
no effect on those things . this is what 's affected .
these kinds of things .
people are bringing their true selves , basically .
they 're bringing themselves .
they bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , residue over them .
so this is what 's driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
`` so when i tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , `` '' it feels fake . '' '' right ? ''
so i said , fake it till you make it .
it 's not me .
i do n't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
i do n't want to feel like an impostor .
i do n't want to get there only to feel like i 'm not supposed to be here .
and that really resonated with me , because i want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like i 'm not supposed to be here .
when i was 19 , i was in a really bad car accident .
i was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
i was thrown from the car .
and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward , and i had been withdrawn from college , and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations , which was very traumatic .
i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart , and i had been called gifted as a child .
so i 'm taken out of college , i keep trying to go back .
`` they say , `` '' you 're not going to finish college . ''
`` just , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that 's not going to work out for you . '' '' so i really struggled with this , and i have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there 's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that . ''
so i felt entirely powerless .
i worked and worked , and i got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
eventually i graduated from college .
it took me four years longer than my peers , and i convinced someone , my angel advisor , susan fiske , to take me on , and so i ended up at princeton , and i was like , i am not supposed to be here .
i am an impostor .
and the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people .
that 's it .
`` i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said , `` '' i 'm quitting . '' '' she was like , `` '' you are not quitting , because i took a gamble on you , and you 're staying . ''
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
you are going to fake it .
you 're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
you 're just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you 're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience , until you have this moment where you say , 'oh my gosh , i 'm doing it .
`` like , i have become this . i am actually doing this . ' '' '' so that 's what i did . ''
`` five years in grad school , a few years , you know , i 'm at northwestern , i moved to harvard , i 'm at harvard , i 'm not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time i had been thinking , `` not supposed to be here . '' ''
`` so at the end of my first year at harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who i had said , `` '' look , you 've got ta participate or else you 're going to fail , '' '' came into my office . i really did n't know her at all . ''
`` she came in totally defeated , and she said , `` i 'm not supposed to be here . '' ''
and that was the moment for me .
because two things happened .
one was that i realized , oh my gosh , i do n't feel like that anymore .
i do n't feel that anymore , but she does , and i get that feeling .
and the second was , she is supposed to be here !
like , she can fake it , she can become it .
`` so i was like , `` '' yes , you are ! you are supposed to be here ! ''
`` and tomorrow you 're going to fake it , you 're going to make yourself powerful , and , you know — ( applause ) and you 're going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . '' '' you know ? and she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and were like , oh my god , i did n't even notice her sitting there . ( laughter ) she comes back to me months later , and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it , she had actually faked it till she became it . ''
so she had changed .
and so i want to say to you , do n't fake it till you make it .
fake it till you become it .
do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
the last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
so , this is two minutes .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation , for two minutes , try doing this , in the elevator , in a bathroom stall , at your desk behind closed doors .
that 's what you want to do .
configure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
get your testosterone up . get your cortisol down .
do n't leave that situation feeling like , oh , i did n't show them who i am .
leave that situation feeling like , i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am .
so i want to ask you first , you know , both to try power posing , and also i want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
i do n't have ego involved in this . ( laughter ) give it away . share it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power .
give it to them because they can do it in private .
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
thank you .
( applause )
our world has many superheroes .
but they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
for example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
catadores provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . but they are not acknowledged for it .
here in brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that 's actually recycled .
most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
carroças are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in brazil , much like graffiti and street art .
and this is how i first met these marginalized superheroes .
i am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
in 2007 , i took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
but at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
by adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem .
and also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
so , the thing is , i plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
i have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
and then i realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to brazil .
i met them in argentina , chile , bolivia , south africa , turkey and even in developed countries such as the united states and japan .
and this was when i realized that i needed to have more people join the cause because it 's a big challenge .
and then , i created a collaborative movement called pimp my carroça — ( laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunded event .
thank you .
( applause ) .
so pimp my carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , podiatrists , hair stylists , massage therapists and much more .
but also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
and then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
pimp my carroça took to the streets of são paulo , rio de janeiro and curitiba .
but to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of brazil , we have created pimpx , which is inspired by tedx , and it 's a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of pimp my carroça .
so now everybody can join .
in two years , over 170 catadores , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the pimp my carroça movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
so catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
so now , i 'd like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city .
try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
so next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
muito obrigado , thank you .
( applause ) .
on november 5th , 1990 , a man named el-sayyid nosair walked into a hotel in manhattan and assassinated rabbi meir kahane , the leader of the jewish defense league .
nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen new york city landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the united nations headquarters .
thankfully , those plans were foiled by an fbi informant .
sadly , the 1993 bombing of the world trade center was not .
nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
el-sayyid nosair is my father .
i was born in pittsburgh , pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an egyptian engineer , and a loving american mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
it was n't until i was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
my father exposed me to a side of islam that few people , including the majority of muslims , get to see .
it 's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it does n't take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
however , in every religion , in every population , you 'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
a few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on long island for target practice .
he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning .
we arrived at calverton shooting range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the fbi .
when it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off .
that day , the last bullet i shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone 's surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
`` my uncle turned to the other men , and in arabic said , `` '' ibn abuh . '' '' like father , like son . ''
they all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it was n't until a few years later that i fully understood what they thought was so funny .
they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the world trade center 's north tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
these were the men i looked up to .
these were the men i called ammu , which means uncle .
by the time i turned 19 , i had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood did n't really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
each time i would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
being the perpetual new face in class , i was frequently the target of bullies .
i kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
so for the most part , i spent my time at home reading books and watching tv or playing video games .
for those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , i was n't prepared for the real world .
i 'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person 's race or religion .
so what opened my eyes ?
one of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
through a college prep program , i was able to take part in the national youth convention in philadelphia .
my particular group 's focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which i felt particularly passionate .
the members of our group came from many different walks of life .
one day toward the end of the convention , i found out that one of the kids i had befriended was jewish .
now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and i realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
i had never had a jewish friend before , and frankly i felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life i had been led to believe was insurmountable .
another major turning point came when i found a summer job at busch gardens , an amusement park .
there , i was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
most of my life , i 'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
as chance would have it , i had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people i had ever met .
being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how i would want to be treated .
because of that feeling , i was able to contrast the stereotypes i 'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
i do n't know what it 's like to be gay , but i 'm well acquainted with being judged for something that 's beyond my control .
`` then there was `` '' the daily show . '' '' on a nightly basis , jon stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person 's race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one 's character . ''
he was in many ways a father figure to me when i was in desperate need of one .
inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
one day , i had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that i will hold dear to my heart for as long as i live .
`` she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime , and said , `` i 'm tired of hating people . '' ''
in that instant , i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
zak ebrahim is not my real name .
i changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
well , that 's simple .
i do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although i had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that i did not become fanaticized .
instead , i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
i do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
for the victims of terrorism , i will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father 's actions .
and with that simple fact , i stand here as proof that violence is n't inherent in one 's religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
i am not my father .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you , everybody . ( applause ) thank you all . ( applause ) thanks a lot . ( applause )
good morning !
are you awake ?
they took my name tag , but i wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in arabic ?
anyone ! no one ? all right , no problem .
once upon a time , not long ago , i was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
`` so i looked at the waiter and said , `` do you have a menu ( arabic ) ? '' ''
he looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
`` he said , `` '' sorry ? ( english ) . '' '' i said , `` '' the menu ( arabic ) , please . '' '' he replied , `` '' do n't you know what they call it ? '' '' `` i do . '' ''
`` he said , `` '' no ! it 's called `` '' menu '' '' ( english ) , or `` '' menu '' '' ( french ) . '' '' is the french pronunciation correct ? ''
`` `` '' come , come , take care of this one ! '' '' said the waiter . ''
`` he was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , `` if this was the last girl on earth , i would n't look at her ! '' ''
`` what 's the meaning of saying `` '' menu '' '' in arabic ? ''
two words made a lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
how could she speak that way ?
at that moment , i started thinking .
it made me mad .
it definitely hurts !
i 'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
where could this happen ?
how did we get here ?
well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they 're modern and civilized .
should i forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
should i forget everything i learned in arabic , just to conform ?
to be one of them ?
where 's the logic in that ?
despite all that , i tried to understand him .
i did n't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
the arabic language does n't satisfy today 's needs .
it 's not a language for science , research , a language we 're used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely is n't a language we use at the airport .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
where can i use it , then ? we could all ask this question !
so , you want us to use arabic . where are we to do so ?
this is one reality .
but we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
arabic is the mother tongue .
research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
how ?
gibran khalil gibran , when he first started writing , he used arabic .
all his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
so , when he started writing in english , he had enough baggage .
even when he wrote in english , when you read his writings in english , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
you can imagine that that 's him writing in english , the same boy who came from the mountain . from a village on mount lebanon .
so , this is an example no one can argue with .
second , it 's often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
this is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
the germans , french , japanese and chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
that 's why they legislate to protect their language .
they make it sacred .
that 's why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
do we know better than them ?
all right , we are n't from the developed world , this advanced thinking has n't reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as turkey , malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
they kept it close to them .
because if you get any product from turkey or elsewhere and it 's not labeled in turkish , then it is n't a local product .
you would n't believe it 's a local product .
they 'd go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
so , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
`` if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( arabic ) , '' '' what does this remind you of ? ''
it does n't ring a bell , does it ?
regardless of the who , how and why .
language is n't just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
`` so when we say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence , '' '' each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period . ''
language is n't one , two or three words or letters put together .
it 's an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
what is our intellect ?
how do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
`` so , if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( english ) , '' '' or if your son came up to you and said , `` dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( english ) slogan ? '' ''
how would you feel ?
if you do n't see a problem , then i 'd better leave , and stop talking in vain .
the idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
i have a francophone friend who 's married to a french man .
i asked her once how things were going .
`` she said , `` '' everything is fine , but once , i spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni ' for him . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) the poor woman had mistakenly told him `` '' toqborni , '' '' and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him . ''
`` he was puzzled by the thought : `` '' how could anyone be this cruel ? ''
does she want to commit suicide ?
`` 'bury me ? ' ( english ) '' '' this is one of the few examples . ''
it made us feel that she 's unable to tell that word to her husband , since he wo n't understand , and he 's right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
`` she said to me , `` '' he listens to fairuz with me , and one night , i tried to translate for him so he can feel what i feel when i listen to fairuz . '' '' the poor woman tried to translate this for him : `` from them i extended my hands and stole you — '' ( laughter ) and here 's the pickle : `` and because you belong to them , i returned my hands and left you . '' ( laughter ) ''
translate that for me .
( applause ) so , what have we done to protect the arabic language ?
we turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the arabic language .
`` even though many people told me , `` '' why do you bother ? ''
`` forget about this headache and go have fun . '' '' no problem ! ''
`` the campaign to preserve arabic launched a slogan that says , `` i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west . '' ''
`` we did n't say , `` '' no ! we do not accept this or that . '' '' we did n't adopt this style because that way , we would n't be understood . ''
and when someone talks to me that way , i hate the arabic language .
we say— ( applause ) we want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
in a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
`` so , `` '' i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west '' '' has hit the spot . ''
something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
after that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
`` you 've seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with `` '' do n't kill your language ! '' '' written on it . ''
why ? seriously , do n't kill your language .
we really should n't kill our language .
if we were to kill the language , we 'd have to find an identity .
we 'd have to find an existence .
we 'd go back to the beginning .
this is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
after that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the arabic letter .
`` photos of `` '' cool '' '' guys and girls . ''
we are very cool !
`` and to whoever might say , `` '' ha ! you used an english word ! '' '' i say , `` '' no ! i adopt the word 'cool . ' '' '' let them object however they want , but give me a word that 's nicer and matches the reality better . ''
`` i will keep on saying `` '' internet '' '' i would n't say : `` '' i 'm going to the world wide web '' '' ( laughs ) because it does n't fit ! we should n't kid ourselves . ''
but to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we should n't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
creativity is the idea .
so , if we ca n't reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
at this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
let 's start from this moment .
let 's write a novel or produce a short film .
a single novel could make us global again .
it could bring the arabic language back to being number one .
so , it 's not true that there 's no solution ; there is a solution !
but we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
in conclusion , what can you do today ?
now , tweets , who 's tweeting ?
please , i beg of you , even though my time has finished , either arabic , english , french or chinese .
but do n't write arabic with latin characters mixed with numbers !
( applause ) it 's a disaster ! that 's not a language .
you 'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
it 's not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
that 's the first thing we can do .
second , there are many other things that we can do .
we 're not here today to convince each other .
we 're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
now i will tell you a secret .
a baby first identifies its father through language .
`` when my daughter is born , i 'll tell her , `` '' this is your father , honey ( arabic ) . '' '' i would n't say , `` '' this is your dad , honey ( english ) . '' '' and in the supermarket , i promise my daughter noor , that if she says to me , `` '' thanks ( arabic ) , '' '' i wo n't say , `` '' dis , 'merci , maman , ' '' '' and hope no one has heard her . ''
( applause ) let 's get rid of this cultural cringe . ( applause )
there 's a few things i learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
i would never have been that adventurous before i started my 30-day challenges .
it 's awful .
in fact , they 're a ton of fun .
( applause )
i 'd done well at school . expectations for me were high , and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
underneath , i was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me .
`` i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i 'd done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , `` she is leaving the room . '' ''
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
`` `` she is opening the door . '' ''
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
and the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything i did in the third person .
`` `` she is going to a lecture . '' ''
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people do n't hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
i spent some time telling the college g.p .
and to be fair , i was desperate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange commentator .
`` for example , i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , i said , `` '' i 'm sorry , doctor , i 've got to go . ''
it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
a hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
you see that glass of water ?
in effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which i felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
by now , i had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
a broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who 've helped me .
i believe that eleanor can get through this .
`` sometimes , you know , it snows as late as may , but summer always comes eventually . '' '' fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place . ''
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i 'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
so for example , voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
now at first , i would have believed them .
i remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents ' room to protect them from what i thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
`` it was like , `` '' do n't mess with me . ''
`` i 've got a plastic fork , do n't you know ? '' '' strategic . ''
it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
i 'm now very proud to be a part of intervoice , the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr. sandra escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
this type of society is not only possible , it 's already on its way .
to paraphrase chavez , once social change begins , it can not be reversed .
you can not humiliate the person who feels pride .
you can not oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
in the last 20 years , the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
as peter levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone 's suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
the light never goes out .
`` as a very wonderful doctor once said to me , `` '' do n't tell me what other people have told you about yourself . ''
`` tell me about you . '' '' thank you . ''

i 'm here to share my photography .
or is it photography ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you ca n't take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
when i say realism , i mean photo-realism .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it 's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
but what 's the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
it 's not really what is realistic , it 's what we think looks realistic really .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it ca n't .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply does n't accept the fact that it does n't really make sense .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
it 's just really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it 's the things that we do n't even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these images are n't really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
so here 's another example .
( laughter ) one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's manipulated .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you do n't need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
the shores are from a different location .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
then it 's about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .

chris anderson : julian , welcome .
it 's been reported that wikileaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined .
can that possibly be true ?
julian assange : yeah , can it possibly be true ?
it 's a worry — is n't it ? — that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
ca : how does it work ?
how do people release the documents ?
and how do you secure their privacy ?
ja : so these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
so we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to enact those legal protections .
we get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do , when you 're talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
ca : so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
ja : that 's right , yeah . very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( phone ring ) god damn it .
( laughter ) ca : i think that 's the cia asking what the code is for a ted membership . ( laughter )
so let 's take [ an ] example , actually .
this is something you leaked a few years ago .
if we can have this document up ...
so this was a story in kenya a few years ago .
can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
ja : so this is the kroll report .
this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
prior to 2004 , kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about 18 years .
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
and when kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in kenya .
it 's the holy grail of kenyan journalism .
so i went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , december 28 .
when we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , daniel arap moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around president kibaki 's neck .
ca : and — i mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
ja : yeah . so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya , in tanzanian and south african press .
and so it came in from the outside .
and that , after a couple of days , made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on kenyan tv , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
ca : wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
ja : yep .
( applause ) ca : here 's — we 're going to just show a short clip from this baghdad airstrike video .
the video itself is longer , but here 's a short clip .
this is — this is intense material , i should warn you .
radio : ... just fuckin ' , once you get on 'em just open 'em up .
i see your element , uh , got about four humvees , uh , out along ...
you 're clear . all right . firing .
let me know when you 've got them . let 's shoot .
light 'em all up .
c'mon , fire !
( machine gun fire ) keep shoot 'n . keep shoot 'n . ( machine gun fire ) keep shoot 'n .
hotel ... bushmaster two-six , bushmaster two-six ,
we need to move , time now !
all right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
yeah , we see two birds [ helicopters ] , and we 're still firing .
roger . i got 'em .
two-six , this is two-six , we 're mobile .
oops , i 'm sorry . what was going on ?
god damn it , kyle . all right , hahaha . i hit 'em .
ca : so , what was the impact of that ?
ja : the impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story .
so this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
ca : so , i mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two reuters employees ?
ja : yeah . two reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
there were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
ca : and releasing this caused widespread outrage .
what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
ja : i do n't know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
and there was two journalists involved that clearly were n't insurgents because that 's their full-time job .
ca : i mean , there 's been this u.s. intelligence analyst , bradley manning , arrested , and it 's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified u.s. embassy cables .
i mean , did he ?
ja : we have denied receiving those cables .
he has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the reykjavik u.s. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
i mean , i was a known visitor of that embassy .
ca : i mean , if you did receive thousands of u.s. embassy diplomatic cables ...
ja : we would have released them . ( ca : you would ? ) ja : yeah . ( ca : because ? ) ja : well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
if you look at declassified cables , that 's the sort of material that 's there .
ca : so let 's talk a little more broadly about this .
i mean , in general , what 's your philosophy ?
why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
ja : well , there 's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
and there 's a lot of information .
so information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that 's a really good signal that when the information gets out , there 's a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
and that 's what we 've found in practice , and that 's what the history of journalism is .
ca : but are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
ja : not that we have seen with anything we have released .
i mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
but there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that 's a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
ca : so they are well-motivated .
`` and what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u.s. military , and he says , `` '' you know what , you 've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out . ''
it shows a u.s. soldier laughing at people dying .
that gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that u.s. soldiers are inhuman people .
`` actually , they 're not . my son is n't . how dare you ? '' '' what would you say to that ? ''
ja : yeah , we do get a lot of that .
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan — they do n't need to see the video ; they see it every day .
so it 's not going to change their opinion . it 's not going to change their perception .
that 's what they see every day .
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that 's our hope .
ca : so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
light is good .
but do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
ja : not really . i mean , we do n't have any wikileaks dissidents yet .
we do n't have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
ca : i 'd actually be interested , just based on what we 've heard so far — i 'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience .
you know , there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian .
you know , hero — people 's hero — bringing this important light .
dangerous troublemaker .
who 's got the hero view ?
who 's got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
ja : oh , come on . there must be some .
ca : it 's a soft crowd , julian , a soft crowd .
we have to try better . let 's show them another example .
now here 's something that you have n't yet leaked , but i think for ted you are .
i mean it 's an intriguing story that 's just happened , right ?
what is this ?
ja : so this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
so late last year — in november last year — there was a series of well blowouts in albania , like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico , but not quite as big .
and we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
and part of the albanian government was in this , etc. , etc .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
we could n't verify it because we did n't know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
`` so under that basis , we put it out and said , `` '' look , we 're skeptical about this thing . ''
we do n't know , but what can we do ?
`` the material looks good , it feels right , but we just ca n't verify it . '' '' and we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( laughter ) saying , `` '' hey , we want to track down the source . '' '' and we were like , `` '' oh , tell us more . ''
what document is it , precisely , you 're talking about ?
can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
`` is it really yours ? '' '' so they sent us this screen shot with the author in the microsoft word id . ''
yeah .
( applause ) that 's happened quite a lot though .
this is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
ca : yeah . have you had information from inside bp ?
ja : yeah , we have a lot , but i mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
so our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we 're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
that 's a problem .
i mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we 're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but do n't have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
ca : so that 's the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and/or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
ja : yep . yeah , and trusted people .
i mean , we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
ca : so help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
and i think i read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
can that be right ?
ja : well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
( laughter ) ca : i mean , a psychologist might say that 's a recipe for breeding paranoia .
ja : what , the movie business ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) ca : and you were also — i mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
ja : well , i was a journalist .
you know , i was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
i wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
i mean there 's like — there 's a method that can be deployed for various things .
unfortunately , at the moment , it 's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother 's bank accounts .
so this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
ca : yeah , well , i certainly do n't think you 're stealing anyone 's grandmother 's bank account , but what about your core values ?
can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
ja : i 'm not sure about the incident .
but the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
and that 's something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
ca : capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
ja : yeah . and you know , i 'm a combative person , so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
and so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
ca : so just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in iceland ?
you basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
instead , they publicized your side .
that made you very high-profile in iceland . what happened next ?
ja : yeah , this is a great case , you know .
iceland went through this financial crisis .
it was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
its banking sector was 10 times the gdp of the rest of the economy .
anyway , so we release this report in july last year .
`` and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , `` this has never happened before . what do we do ? '' ''
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in iceland , went to iceland and spoke about this issue .
and there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new nobel prize for freedom of speech .
iceland 's a nordic country , so , like norway , it 's able to tap into the system .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously .
ca : wow .
( applause ) last question , julian .
when you think of the future then , do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it 's just all to be played for either way ?
ja : i 'm not sure which way it 's going to go .
i mean , there 's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the e.u. , between china and the united states .
which way is it going to go ? it 's hard to see .
that 's why it 's a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
ca : well , it looks like i 'm reflecting the audience 's opinion to say , julian , be careful , and all power to you .
ja : thank you , chris . ( ca : thank you . ) ( applause )
i 'm a storyteller .
that 's what i do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
i will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
i was born in strasbourg , france to turkish parents .
shortly after , my parents got separated , and i came to turkey with my mom .
from then on , i was raised as a single child by a single mother .
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual .
our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
in fact , i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
on the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman .
on the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
each time , my grandmother would utter some words in arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
a week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
now , i 'm aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
i asked her how she did this . was it the power of praying ?
`` in response she said , `` '' yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . '' '' from her , i learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls . ''
it will dry up inside .
now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
we all do .
we 're born into a certain family , nation , class .
but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
ironically , [ living in ] communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today 's globalized world .
and it 's happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , east and west alike .
we tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
in my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
stories can not demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
and through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
i started writing fiction at the age of eight .
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i 'd be interested in keeping a personal journal .
in retrospect , i think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
i was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except i told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
i was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
what she did n't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself .
instead , i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
and thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
so from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
and please bear with me : i 'll draw a circle and come back to this point .
now one other thing happened around this same time .
my mother became a diplomat .
so from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , i was zoomed into this posh , international school [ in madrid ] , where i was the only turk .
`` it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the `` '' representative foreigner . '' '' in our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy . ''
instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
we were like a miniature united nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
and i should know , because during the time i attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope , and turkey got zero points in [ the ] eurovision song contest .
( laughter ) i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
`` the other children asked me about the movie `` '' midnight express , '' '' which i had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day i smoked , because they thought all turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair . ''
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
after spain , we went to jordan , germany and ankara again .
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me .
stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big cs that i otherwise lacked .
in my mid-twenties , i moved to istanbul , the city i adore .
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .
i was in istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
when i ran out of the building at three in the morning , i saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
there was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who did n't sell alcohol and did n't speak to marginals .
he was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
in the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
but i 've always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
i 'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
shortly after , i went to a women 's college in boston , then michigan .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
i started writing fiction in english .
i 'm not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why i do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
i love writing in turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
so i feel connected to each language in a different way .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
when you 're a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
as latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there 's a gap between the mind and the tongue .
and that gap is very intimidating .
but if we manage not to be frightened by it , it 's also stimulating .
and this is what i discovered in boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
at this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all .
and because god loves her , i did get married .
( laughter ) but instead of settling down , i went to arizona .
and since my husband is in istanbul , i started commuting between arizona and istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that could n't be more different .
i guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i 've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
and this is a subject that i would love to think about together .
when my first novel written in english came out in america , i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
`` `` i liked your book , '' he said , `` but i wish you had written it differently . '' ''
( laughter ) i asked him what he meant by that .
`` he said , `` '' well , look at it . there 's so many spanish , american , hispanic characters in it , but there 's only one turkish character and it 's a man . '' '' now the novel took place on a university campus in boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters , but i understood what my critic was looking for . ''
and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him .
he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one .
we often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
many authors feel this pressure , but non-western authors feel it more heavily .
if you 're a woman writer from the muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women .
you 're expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your western colleagues .
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today .
writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from china , a few from turkey , a few from nigeria .
we 're all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
the writer and commuter james baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
`` when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , baldwin stopped and said , `` '' but do n't you see ? there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . '' '' when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger . ''
there 's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together .
i never forget my first multicultural reading , in harvard square about 10 years ago .
we were three writers , one from the philippines , one turkish and one indonesian — like a joke , you know .
( laughter ) and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
it was only because of our passports .
multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
a function is attributed to fiction .
in this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
but i must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the west .
it comes from everywhere .
and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
i had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women .
my micro story became a macro issue when i was prosecuted .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
it was just a story .
`` and when i say , `` '' just a story , '' '' i 'm not trying to belittle my work . ''
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
`` chekhov said , `` '' the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things . ''
`` and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility . '' '' identity politics divides us . fiction connects . ''
one is interested in sweeping generalizations .
the other , in nuances .
one draws boundaries .
the other recognizes no frontiers .
identity politics is made of solid bricks .
fiction is flowing water .
`` in the ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called `` '' meddah . '' '' they would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising . ''
with each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , muslims and non-muslims .
`` stories cut across all boundaries , like `` '' the tales of nasreddin hodja , '' '' which were very popular throughout the middle east , north africa , the balkans and asia . ''
today , stories continue to transcend borders .
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk , they usually do n't listen to each other , but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
literature has to take us beyond .
if it can not take us there , it is not good literature .
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was — that i once was .
but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
when the poet and mystic , rumi , met his spiritual companion , shams of tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
`` the sufis say , `` '' knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . '' '' the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected . ''
there 's a metaphor which i love : living like a drawing compass .
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
like that , my fiction as well .
one part of it is rooted in istanbul , with strong turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
in that sense , i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
now those of you who have been to istanbul have probably seen topkapi palace , which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
in the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there 's an area called the gathering place of the djinn .
it 's between buildings .
i 'm intrigued by this concept .
we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
when i write fiction i cherish elusiveness and changeability .
i like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
i like it when my characters surprise me .
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a handsome , gay professor in norway .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
`` audre lorde once said , `` '' the white fathers taught us to say , 'i think , therefore i am . ' '' '' she suggested , `` '' i feel , therefore i am free . '' '' i think it was a wonderful paradigm shift . ''
`` and yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is `` '' write what you know '' '' ? ''
perhaps that 's not the right way to start at all .
imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
in the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
`` and i would like to finish with an old sufi poem : `` '' come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . '' '' thank you . ''
( applause )
my big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( laughter ) ( applause ) this is a room of type-a women . this is a room
of sleep-deprived women .
and i learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
two-and-a-half years ago , i fainted from exhaustion .
i hit my head on my desk . i broke my cheekbone , i got five stitches on my right eye .
and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
and in the course of that , i studied , i met with medical doctors , scientists , and i 'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
( applause ) and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( laughter ) ( applause ) because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
`` and i felt like saying to him — but i did n't say it — i felt like saying , `` '' you know what ? ''
`` if you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . '' '' ( laughter ) there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship . ''
`` especially here in washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , `` '' how about eight o'clock ? '' '' they 're likely to tell you , `` '' eight o'clock is too late for me , but that 's okay , i can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . '' '' and they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they 're not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions . ''
so a high i.q .
does not mean that you 're a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the titanic .
and we 've had far too many icebergs hitting our titanics .
in fact , i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters , they might still be around .
( applause ) while all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what 's going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
so i urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
thank you .
( applause )
i essentially became an infant in a woman 's body .
if you 've ever seen a human brain , it 's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
excuse me . thank you . it 's been a joy .
information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
i am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
and in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
my left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
and our left hemisphere thinks in language .
and all i could detect was this energy — energy .
`` and i 'm asking myself , `` '' what is wrong with me ? ''
and i felt lighter in my body .
