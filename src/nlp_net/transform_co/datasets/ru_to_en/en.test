by the end of this year , there 'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
the one thing that all of them have in common is that they 're going to die .
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought , i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
what first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by derek k. miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
here 's what he wrote in starting that out .
`` he said , `` '' here it is . i 'm dead , and this is my last post to my blog . ''
`` in advance , i asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message i wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . '' '' now , while as a journalist , miller 's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that 's something completely different than anything that 's been created by any previous generation . ''
consider a few stats for a moment .
right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute .
there are 200 million tweets being posted every day .
and the average facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
so when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
but today we 're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that 's going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we 're gone .
and i think that 's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
now to be clear , i 'm a journalist and not a technologist , so what i 'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
now we 're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
one of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when i checked into a deli at a restaurant in new york on foursquare .
( recording ) adam ostrow : hello .
death : adam ?
ao : yeah .
death : death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the organic .
ao : who is this ?
death : go to ifidie.net before it 's too late .
( laughter ) adam ostrow : kind of creepy , right ?
so what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to facebook after you die .
another service right now is called 1,000 memories .
and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .
now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who , back in march , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
i think as machines ' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it 's going to become possible to analyze an entire life 's worth of content — the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we 're producing in such massive numbers .
and i think as that happens , it 's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we 're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we 're creating and technology 's ability to make sense of it all .
now we 're already starting to see some experiments here .
one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream , everything you 've posted onto twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
taking it a step further , mit 's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the united states , where cnn beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with anderson cooper .
what if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
i think that 's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we 're producing and technology 's ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
thank you very much .

people returning to work after a career break : i call them relaunchers .
these are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers .
employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition , and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers , especially if they 've been out for a long time .
this disconnect is a problem that i 'm trying to help solve .
now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
this is sami kafala .
he 's a nuclear physicist in the uk who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
the singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks .
and speaking of long career breaks , this is mimi kahn .
she 's a social worker in orange county , california , who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break .
that 's the longest career break that i 'm aware of .
supreme court justice sandra day o'connor took a five-year career break early in her career .
and this is tracy shapiro , who took a 13-year career break .
tracy answered a call for essays by the today show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it .
tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we 've put in a good day in the job search .
she was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
i met tracy in june of 2011 , when the today show asked me if i could work with her to see if i could help her turn things around .
the first thing i told tracy was she had to get out of the house .
i told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
`` i also told her , `` '' you are going to have a lot of conversations that do n't go anywhere . ''
expect that , and do n't be discouraged by it .
`` there will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity . '' '' i 'll tell you what happened with tracy in a little bit , but i want to share with you a discovery that i made when i was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce . ''
and that is , that people 's view of you is frozen in time .
what i mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
and that 's even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
so for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
this is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan .
or here i am in the kitchen .
but those people from the past , they do n't know about any of this .
they only remember you as you were , and it 's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
there 's one more thing i remember vividly from my own career break .
and that was that i hardly kept up with the business news .
my background is in finance , and i hardly kept up with any news when i was home caring for my four young children .
so i was afraid i 'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that did n't exist anymore .
so i had to resubscribe to the wall street journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before i felt like i had a handle on what was going on in the business world again .
i believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here 's why .
think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
we did that already .
we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
we 're in a more settled time of life .
we have great work experience .
we have a more mature perspective .
we 're not trying to find ourselves at an employer 's expense .
plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we 've been away from it for a while .
on the flip side , i speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
the first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
now , i can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it 's a temporary condition .
i had done my financial analysis so long ago that i used lotus 1-2-3 .
i do n't know if anyone can even remember back that far , but i had to relearn it on excel .
it actually was n't that hard . a lot of the commands are the same .
i found powerpoint much more challenging , but now i use powerpoint all the time .
i tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
and if they 're not up to speed , then it 's their responsibility to get there .
and they do .
i tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
that 's not the employer 's job .
it 's the relauncher 's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
back in 2010 i started noticing something .
i had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , i started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship-like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
i saw goldman sachs and sara lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
i saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
i saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
`` so i wrote a report about what i was seeing , and it became this article for harvard business review called `` '' the 40-year-old intern . '' '' i have to thank the editors there for that title , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns . ''
`` and then , courtesy of fox business news , they called the concept `` '' the 50-year-old intern . '' '' ( laughter ) so five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals . ''
and at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
these internships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
and now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the society of women engineers .
now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews , and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over .
this testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
think about how far we have come .
before this , most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all .
but now , not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind , but you ca n't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé .
this is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transitioners too .
in fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program .
and there 's no reason why there ca n't be a retiree internship program .
different pool , same concept .
so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro .
remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for tracy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
but it was a temp job .
the company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more , but no guarantees .
this was in the fall of 2011 .
tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
so even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what tracy could handle .
fast forward to 2015 , tracy 's been promoted .
they 've paid for her to get her mba at night .
she 's even hired another relauncher to work for her .
tracy 's temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both tracy and her employer .
now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
but in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , do n't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
thank you .

today i 'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
it 's just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
( laughter ) we 'll just — we can just skip — i 'll just skip through the video instead ... ( laughter )
no . ( laughter ) ( laughter )
( music ) this is not ... ( laughter )
okay . ( laughter )
solar technology is ...
oh , that 's all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
( applause )
it was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck .
the second quote is from the head of the uk financial services authority .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
then , predictions can be made and tested .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
where are economic networks ?
what we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
how are they organized ? are they isolated ?
these are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
let me explain by giving you this analogy .
hi . today , i 'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with danish artist soren pors .
we call ourselves pors and rao , and we live and work in india .
`` i 'd like to begin with my very first object , which i call `` '' the uncle phone . '' '' and it was inspired by my uncle 's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like i were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes . ''
and as i grew up , it became worse and worse , and i started to think of it as a form of control .
but of course , i could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the indian family .
and the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
he would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
`` and so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , i made him `` '' the uncle phone . '' '' it 's so long that it requires two people to use it . ''
it 's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that 's designed for one person .
but the problem is that , when i left home and went to college , i started missing his commands .
and so i made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
so what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
this device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
so here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
so my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
`` the next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call `` '' the pygmies . '' '' and we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures . ''
so how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
and as soon as it 's silent , they sort of creep out .
and if it 's even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
and at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
so we had these panels on three walls of a room .
and we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
so this is how it works .
this is a video prototype .
so when it 's quiet , it 's sort of coming out from behind the panels .
and they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
so they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
and they do n't react to background sounds .
you 'll hear a train in moment that they do n't react to .
( noise ) but they react to foreground sounds . you 'll hear that in a second .
( whistling ) so we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
so each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
so this is a very early prototype .
of course , it got much better after that .
and we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
`` this is a video installation called `` '' the missing person . '' '' and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility . ''
how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
so i 'm just going to show you a very early prototype .
on the right side you can see my colleague soren , who 's actually in the space .
and on the left side , you 'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
soren enters the room . pop ! he goes invisible .
and you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
it 's a very early video , so we have n't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
so how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
and as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
`` so this is a work called `` '' the sun shadow . '' '' and it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun . ''
and from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
so people would walking into the room and they 'd almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
and it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
( laughter ) so this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
his head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it 's sort of fallen into his hat , and his body 's grown out of him almost like a plant .
well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
and it 's kind of constrained by that circle .
because if that circle were n't there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
and there 's no wires .
so i 'll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
and it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it 's almost about to fall .
and this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
but it does n't really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
so this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it did n't fall enough , it would n't instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
so i 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it 's much faster .
that 's my colleague . he 's let it go .
now he 's getting nervous , so he 's going to go catch it .
but he does n't need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
so this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
and it 's at the scale of the night sky .
so we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
`` so this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it 's called `` '' space filler . '' '' well imagine a small cube that 's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that 's twice its height and [ eight ] times its volume . ''
and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
so we work with a lot of technology , but we do n't really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
but we use it because we 're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
and once a creature pops into our minds , it 's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
thank you .
( applause )
i 'm really glad to be here .
i 'm glad you 're here , because that would be a little weird .
i 'm glad we 're all here .
`` and by `` '' here , '' '' i do n't mean here . ''
or here .
but here .
i mean earth .
`` and by `` '' we , '' '' i do n't mean those of us in this auditorium , but life , all life on earth — ( laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from mold to mushrooms to flying bears . ( laughter ) ''
the interesting thing is , earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8.7 million species .
is earth special ?
this is a question i 've wanted to know the answer to since i was a small child , and i suspect 80 percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer .
to understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life , the first step is to understand what life here requires .
it turns out , of all of those 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
on one side , all life on earth needs energy .
complex life like us derives our energy from the sun , but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions .
there are a number of different energy sources available on all planets .
on the other side , all life needs food or nourishment .
and this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a succulent tomato .
( laughter ) however , all life on earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements , and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system .
so that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole , the thing that 's hardest to achieve .
not moose , but water .
( laughter ) although moose would be pretty cool . ( laughter )
and not frozen water , and not water in a gaseous state , but liquid water .
this is what life needs to survive , all life .
and many solar system bodies do n't have liquid water , and so we do n't look there .
other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water , even more than earth , but it 's trapped beneath an icy shell , and so it 's hard to access , it 's hard to get to , it 's hard to even find out if there 's any life there .
so that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
so let 's make the problem simpler for ourselves .
let 's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
there are only three bodies to think about in our solar system , with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet , and in order of distance from the sun , it 's : venus , earth and mars .
you want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
you have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
you ca n't have too much atmosphere , too thick or too warm an atmosphere , because then you end up too hot like venus , and you ca n't have liquid water .
but if you have too little atmosphere and it 's too thin and too cold , you end up like mars , too cold .
so venus is too hot , mars is too cold , and earth is just right .
you can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system .
it 's a goldilocks-type problem , and it 's so simple that a child could understand it .
however , i 'd like to remind you of two things from the goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that i think are really relevant here .
number one : if mama bear 's bowl is too cold when goldilocks walks into the room , does that mean it 's always been too cold ?
or could it have been just right at some other time ?
when goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer that we get in the story .
and the same is true with planets .
they 're not static things . they change .
they vary . they evolve .
and atmospheres do the same .
so let me give you an example .
here 's one of my favorite pictures of mars .
it 's not the highest resolution image , it 's not the sexiest image , it 's not the most recent image , but it 's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet ; riverbeds carved by flowing , liquid water ; riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form .
this ca n't happen on mars today .
the atmosphere of mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid .
this one image tells you that the atmosphere of mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
and it changed from a state that we would define as habitable , because the three requirements for life were present long ago .
where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface ?
well , one idea is it escaped away to space .
atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the planet , escaping away to space , never to return .
and this happens with all bodies with atmospheres .
comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape .
but venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time , and mars and earth as well .
it 's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
so we 'd like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition .
how do atmospheres get their energy for escape ?
how do particles get enough energy to escape ?
there are two ways , if we 're going to reduce things a little bit .
number one , sunlight .
light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles .
yes , i 'm dancing , but they — ( laughter ) oh my god , not even at my wedding . ( laughter )
they get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming .
a second way they can get energy is from the solar wind .
these are particles , mass , material , spit out from the surface of the sun , and they go screaming through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second , sometimes faster during solar storms , and they go hurtling through interplanetary space towards planets and their atmospheres , and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as well .
this is something that i 'm interested in , because it relates to habitability .
i mentioned that there were two things about the goldilocks story that i wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about , and the second one is a little bit more subtle .
if papa bear 's bowl is too hot , and mama bear 's bowl is too cold , should n't baby bear 's bowl be even colder if we 're following the trend ?
this thing that you 've accepted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
and of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
this has to play into habitability .
but maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
maybe it 's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story , what is just right .
i could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets that may influence habitability , but for selfish reasons related to my own research and the fact that i 'm standing up here holding the clicker and you 're not — ( laughter ) i would like to talk for just a minute or two about magnetic fields .
earth has one ; venus and mars do not .
magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds earth .
if you have a compass , you know which way north is .
venus and mars do n't have that .
if you have a compass on venus and mars , congratulations , you 're lost .
( laughter ) does this influence habitability ?
well , how might it ?
many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet serves as a shield for the atmosphere , deflecting solar wind particles around the planet in a bit of a force field-type effect having to do with electric charge of those particles .
i like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets .
ok , so the effect , then , is that earth may have been protected for billions of years , because we 've had a magnetic field .
atmosphere has n't been able to escape .
mars , on the other hand , has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field , and over billions of years , maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today .
other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship , enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
the sails may gather energy from the solar wind .
the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
it 's an idea that has to be tested , but the effect and how it works seems apparent .
that 's because we know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on earth .
that energy is conducted along magnetic field lines down into the polar regions , resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora .
if you 've ever experienced them , it 's magnificent .
we know the energy is getting in .
we 're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
so i 've posed a problem for you here , but i do n't have a solution yet .
we do n't have a solution .
but we 're working on it . how are we working on it ?
well , we 've sent spacecraft to all three planets .
some of them are orbiting now , including the maven spacecraft which is currently orbiting mars , which i 'm involved with and which is led here , out of the university of colorado .
it 's designed to measure atmospheric escape .
we have similar measurements from venus and earth .
once we have all our measurements , we can combine all these together , and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment , with the surroundings .
and we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability or not .
once we have that answer , why should you care ?
i mean , i care deeply ...
and financially as well , but deeply .
( laughter ) first of all , an answer to this question will teach us more about these three planets , venus , earth and mars , not only about how they interact with their environment today , but how they were billions of years ago , whether they were habitable long ago or not .
it will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close .
but moreover , what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere , including planets that we 're now observing around other stars .
for example , the kepler spacecraft , which is built and controlled here in boulder , has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky for a couple years now , and it 's found thousands of planets — in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky that we do n't think is any different from any other part of the sky .
we 've gone , in 20 years , from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system , to now having so many , that we do n't know which ones to investigate first .
any lever will help .
in fact , based on observations that kepler 's taken and other similar observations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion stars in the milky way galaxy alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
in addition to that , estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy .
we have the observations of those planets , but we just do n't know which ones are habitable yet .
it 's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them , wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you .
you ca n't do that . you ca n't go there , not yet .
and so you have to use the tools that you 've developed around you for venus , earth and mars , and you have to apply them to these other situations , and hope that you 're making reasonable inferences from the data , and that you 're going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets , and those that are not .
in the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
this is the only planet that we know of that 's habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
but for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
i 'm really glad we 're here .
thanks .

i love the internet .
it 's true .
think about everything it has brought us .
think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
and it 's happening during our lifetimes .
i 'm pretty sure that one day we 'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
but yes , it 's also true that the internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
i 've spent my career fighting these problems .
so let me show you something .
this here is brain .
this is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by brain.a .
it 's the first virus we ever found for pc computers .
and we actually know where brain came from .
we know because it says so inside the code .
let 's take a look .
all right .
`` that 's the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we 'll see that right there , it says , `` '' welcome to the dungeon . '' '' and then it continues , saying , 1986 , basit and amjad . ''
and basit and amjad are first names , pakistani first names .
in fact , there 's a phone number and an address in pakistan .
( laughter ) now , 1986 .
now it 's 2011 .
that 's 25 years ago .
the pc virus problem is 25 years old now .
so half a year ago , i decided to go to pakistan myself .
so let 's see , here 's a couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan .
this is from the city of lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from abbottabad , where bin laden was caught .
here 's a typical street view .
and here 's the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 nizam block at allama iqbal town .
and i knocked on the door .
( laughter ) you want to guess who opened the door ?
basit and amjad ; they are still there .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so here standing up is basit .
sitting down is his brother amjad .
these are the guys who wrote the first pc virus .
now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
i asked them why .
i asked them how they feel about what they started .
and i got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both basit and amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
so let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
what i 'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
so let me just mount some drives . go over there .
what we have here is a list of old viruses .
so let me just run some viruses on my computer .
for example , let 's go with the centipede virus first .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there 's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
you know that you 're infected because it actually shows up .
here 's another one . this is the virus called crash , invented in russia in 1992 .
let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
( siren noise ) and the last example , guess what the walker virus does ?
yes , there 's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
so it used to be fairly easy to know that you 're infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
today , viruses are a global problem .
what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
so we can actually see in real time that we 've just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and russia and elsewhere .
in fact , if i just connect back to our lab systems through the web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
here 's the latest virus we 've found , in a file called server.exe .
and we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
and if we just scroll around , it 's just massive .
we find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
and that 's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
so where are all these coming from then ?
well today , it 's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
it 's gangs like — let 's go to gangstabucks.com .
this is a website operating in moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
so if you are a virus writer and you 're capable of infecting windows computers , but you do n't know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else 's computers — to these guys .
and they 'll actually pay you money for those computers .
so how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
well there 's multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
so you 're sitting on your computer and you 're doing google searches .
every single google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
same thing with every single password and so on .
but the thing that they 're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
and here 's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
that 's the credit card number , that 's the expiration date , that 's the security code , and that 's the name of the owner of the card .
once you gain access to other people 's credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
we now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
one example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of interpol and search for wanted persons .
we find guys like bjorn sundin , originally from sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the interpol wanted pages , mr. shaileshkumar jain , a u.s. citizen .
these guys were running an operation called i.m.u. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
they are both right now on the run .
nobody knows where they are .
u.s. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a swiss bank account belonging to mr. jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it .
so the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
and that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
we know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with sql databases .
and they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
i mean , the internet is international .
that 's why we call it the internet .
and if you just go and take a look at what 's happening in the online world , here 's a video built by clarified networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
this operation , believed to be originally from estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
so you just ca n't shut these guys down .
they will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we do n't have the capability to globally police operations like this .
so the internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
now , criminals who were n't capable of reaching us before can reach us .
so how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
how do you actually track them down ?
let me give you an example .
what we have here is one exploit file .
here , i 'm looking at the hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
and that basically means , if you 're trying to view this image file on your windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
now , if you 'll take a look at this image file — well there 's the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
and that code has been encrypted , so let 's decrypt it .
it has been encrypted with xor function 97 .
you just have to believe me , it is , it is .
and we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
and i know , it does n't really look much different from the original .
but just keep staring at it .
you 'll actually see that down here you can see a web address : unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
and that 's a backdoor which will take over your computer .
but even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we 'll find this mysterious string , which says o600ko78rus .
that code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
it 's not used for anything .
and i was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
so obviously i googled for it .
i got zero hits ; was n't there .
so i spoke with the guys at the lab .
and we have a couple of russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in rus like russia .
and 78 is the city code for the city of st. petersburg .
for example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
so i went looking for contacts in st. petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
here 's this russian guy who 's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular live journal .
and on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in st. petersburg — he 's in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
and he drives a very nice car .
in fact , this guy drives a mercedes-benz s600 v12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
now that 's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in st. petersburg .
how do i know about this car ?
because he blogged about the car .
he actually had a car accident .
in downtown st. petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
and he put blogged images about the car accident — that 's his mercedes — right here is the lada samara he crashed into .
and you can actually see that the license plate of the samara ends in 78rus .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mercedes is o600ko78rus .
`` now i 'm not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , `` '' i rest my case . '' '' ( laughter ) so what happens when online criminals are caught ? ''
well in most cases it never gets this far .
the vast majority of the online crime cases , we do n't even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
and even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
the local police do n't act , or if they do , there 's not enough evidence , or for some reason we ca n't take them down .
i wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it is n't .
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
you 've all heard about things like stuxnet .
so if you look at what stuxnet did is that it infected these .
that 's a siemens s7-400 plc , programmable logic [ controller ] .
and this is what runs our infrastructure .
this is what runs everything around us .
plc 's , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
for example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
and when stuxnet infects one of these , that 's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
because everything around us is being run by these .
i mean , we have critical infrastructure .
you go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
everything is being run by computers .
everything is reliant on these computers working .
we have become very reliant on internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted are n't there .
it 's actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
now i told you — ( laughter ) i love the internet . i do .
think about all the services we have online .
think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you do n't actually have them for some reason or another .
i see beauty in the future of the internet , but i 'm worried that we might not see that .
i 'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
( laughter ) i 've spent my life defending the net , and i do feel that if we do n't fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
we have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
what we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
that 's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
what actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but have n't yet done it .
we have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
thank you very much .
( applause )
the world is changing with really remarkable speed .
if you look at the chart at the top here , you 'll see that in 2025 , these goldman sachs projections suggest that the chinese economy will be almost the same size as the american economy .
and if you look at the chart for 2050 , it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size of the american economy , and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy .
and we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis .
a couple of weeks ago , i was looking at the latest projection by bnp paribas for when china will have a larger economy than the united states .
goldman sachs projected 2027 .
the post-crisis projection is 2020 .
that 's just a decade away .
china is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
first of all , it 's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
and within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which i think is what china will become — will be not from the west and from very , very different civilizational roots .
now , i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
this is an illusion .
it 's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
it is not . it is also shaped equally by history and culture .
china is not like the west , and it will not become like the west .
it will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
how do we try to understand what china is ?
and the problem we have in the west at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms , using western ideas .
we ca n't .
now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like , just as a beginning .
the first is this : that china is not really a nation-state .
okay , it 's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about china knows it 's a lot older than this .
this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in 221 b.c . at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern china .
and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china .
or immediately afterward , the han dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china , which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now .
now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives china its sense of being china , what gives the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the west , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
i 'm thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , confucian values and so on .
these are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
in other words , china , unlike the western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
and there 's one other thing to add to this , and that is this : of course we know china 's big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
what we often are n't really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
you ca n't run a place on this scale simply from beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
it 's never been the case .
so this is china , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
and what does it mean ?
well , i think it has all sorts of profound implications .
i 'll give you two quick ones .
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the maintenance of chinese civilization .
you know , 2,000 years ago , europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the holy roman empire .
it divided , and it 's remained divided ever since .
china , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
the second is maybe more prosaic , which is hong kong .
do you remember the handover of hong kong by britain to china in 1997 ?
you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was .
one country , two systems .
and i 'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the west believed them .
`` `` '' window dressing . ''
`` when china gets its hands on hong kong , that wo n't be the case . '' '' thirteen years on , the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in 1997 . ''
we were wrong . why were we wrong ?
we were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
think of german unification , 1990 .
what happened ?
well , basically the east was swallowed by the west .
one nation , one system .
that is the nation-state mentality .
but you ca n't run a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
it does n't work .
so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong — as it will be to the question of taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
let me offer you another building block to try and understand china — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
the chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
do you know , of the 1.3 billion chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the han ?
now , this is completely different from the world 's [ other ] most populous countries .
india , the united states , indonesia , brazil — all of them are multiracial .
the chinese do n't feel like that .
china is only multiracial really at the margins .
so the question is , why ?
well the reason , i think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
a history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the han , china could never have held together .
the han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
the great disadvantage of it is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
they really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
hence their attitude , for example , to the uyghurs and to the tibetans .
or let me give you my third building block , the chinese state .
now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west .
now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese than is true with any western state .
and the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , i think .
and it 's obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the chinese certainly do n't have a democracy .
and the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in china is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
this is as close as china gets to a kind of spiritual role .
and the second reason is because , whereas in europe and north america , the state 's power is continuously challenged — i mean in the european tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the chinese state has not been challenged .
it 's had no serious rivals .
so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history .
the result , by the way , is that the chinese have a very different view of the state .
whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the chinese do n't see the state like that at all .
the chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
this is the chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
it 's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we 've had to think about in the past .
know that china believes in the market and the state .
`` i mean , adam smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , `` '' the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in europe . '' '' and , apart from the mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since . ''
but this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
the state is everywhere in china .
i mean , it 's leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
private firms , however large they are , like lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
and the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
i mean , if you want an illustration of this , the great wall is one .
but this is another , this is the grand canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b.c .
and was finally completed in the seventh century a.d .
it went for 1,114 miles , linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai .
so there 's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china , which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state competence within china .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
and yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience , looking at it through western eyes , using western concepts .
if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong — our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect — this is the reason .
unfortunately , i think , i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality .
it 's kind of arrogant .
it 's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
and secondly , it 's ignorant .
we refuse to really address the issue of difference .
you know , there 's a very interesting passage in a book by paul cohen , the american historian .
and paul cohen argues that the west thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
but it 's not .
in many ways , it 's the most parochial , because for 200 years , the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the west — have been thereby forced to understand the west , because of the west 's presence in those societies .
and therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the west .
i mean , take the question of east asia .
east asia : japan , korea , china , etc . — a third of the world 's population lives there .
now the largest economic region in the world .
and i 'll tell you now , that east asianers , people from east asia , are far more knowledgeable about the west than the west is about east asia .
now this point is very germane , i 'm afraid , to the present .
because what 's happening ? back to that chart at the beginning , the goldman sachs chart .
what is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
we 've seen this in terms of the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 , or the g8 .
and there are two consequences of this .
first , the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — copenhagen , climate change conference .
europe was not at the final negotiating table .
when did that last happen ?
i would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
and that is what is going to happen in the future .
and the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it 'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
and at last , i 'm afraid — take europe ; america is slightly different — but europeans by and large , i have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
`` some people — i 've got an english friend in china , and he said , `` '' the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . '' '' well , maybe that 's true , maybe that 's an exaggeration . ''
but there 's another problem which goes along with this — that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
i mean , europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
take the 19th century , for example .
but this , alas , is no longer true .
if you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try china — there 's old confucius .
this is a railway station the likes of which you 've never seen before .
it does n't even look like a railway station .
this is the new [ wuhan ] railway station for the high-speed trains .
china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
or take this : now this is an idea , but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing .
here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
it travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
and it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
okay , so how would i like to finish ?
well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
but i want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
for 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
that 's what europe and north america represented .
the arrival of countries like china and india — between them 38 percent of the world 's population — and others like indonesia and brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
as humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the south china sea , the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa .
the little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , christopher columbus crossed the atlantic .
( laughter ) or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by zhuzhou in 1368 .
i think they 're playing golf .
christ , the chinese even invented golf .
welcome to the future . thank you .
( applause )
i 'm here today to start a revolution .
now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , i want to define what i mean by revolution .
by revolution , i mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
now why , steve , why do we need a revolution ?
we need a revolution because things are n't working ; they 're just not working .
and that makes me really sad because i 'm sick and tired of things not working .
you know , i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
i 'm sick and tired of us being last .
and we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
we 're last place in europe in innovation .
there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that does n't value innovation .
we 're last place in health care , and that 's important for a sense of well-being .
and there we are , not just last in the e.u. , we 're last in europe , at the very bottom .
and worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , the economist .
we 're the saddest place on earth , relative to gdp per capita — the saddest place on earth .
that 's social . let 's look at education .
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd ?
last in reading , math and science . last .
business : the lowest perception in the e.u .
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
why as a result , what happens ?
the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
we hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
so if our engine 's broken , guess what ?
last in europe gdp per capita .
last .
so it 's no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
we 're unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
and these are facts , guys .
this is n't story tale ; it 's not make-believe .
it 's not .
it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria . these are facts .
so i think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
how did this happen ?
let 's be positive now . we 're going to get positive . how did this happen ?
i think we 're last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
we 're holding ourselves back because we do n't value play .
`` i said `` '' play , '' '' all right . ''
in case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
babies play , kids play , adults play .
we do n't value play .
in fact , we devalue play .
and we devalue it in three areas .
let 's go back to the same three areas .
social : 45 years of what ?
of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
and instead , what do we value ?
because it 's shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
to be serious .
to be really , really serious .
it did .
( applause ) be serious .
i ca n't tell you how many times i 've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
i have been told by babas and dyados that we should n't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
we have a serious meme running through .
it 's a social gene running through us .
it 's a serious gene .
`` it 's 45 years of it that 's created what i call the `` '' baba factor . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and here 's how it works . ''
`` step one : woman says , `` '' i want to have a baby . iskam baby . '' '' step two : we get the baby . woohoo ! ''
but then what happens in step three ?
i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees .
i 'm going to give bebko to baba .
but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
so what happens ?
she passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
what happens then ?
it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
it 's a crap system .
true story : i went looking for a school for my kid .
we went to this prestigious little school and they say they 're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
`` and we said , `` '' well what about play and recess ? '' '' and they said , `` '' ha . there wo n't be a single moment in the schedule . '' '' ( laughter ) and we said , `` '' he 's five . '' '' what a crime . what a crime . ''
and it 's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we 're creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
but i 'm sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
we need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
we do n't need mechanized workers .
but no , now our meme goes into work where we do n't value play .
we create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
what are qualities of a bulgarian work ?
autocratic — do what i say because i 'm the chef .
i 'm the boss and i know better than you .
untrusting — you 're obviously a criminal , so i 'm going to install cameras .
( laughter ) controlling — you 're obviously an idiot , so i 'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you do n't step out of the box .
so they 're restrictive — do n't use your mobile phone , do n't use your laptop , do n't search the internet , do n't be on i.m .
that 's somehow unprofessional and bad .
and at the end of the day , it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled , you 're restricted , you 're not valued and you 're not having any fun .
in social , in education and in our business , do n't value play .
and that 's why we 're last , because we do n't value play .
`` and you can say , `` '' that 's ridiculous , steve . what a dumb idea . ''
it ca n't be because of play .
`` just play , that 's a stupid thing . '' '' we have the serious meme in us . ''
well i 'm going to say no .
and i will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better .
play : our brains are hardwired for play .
evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
and you know what ?
evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that are n't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
nature is n't stupid , and it selected for play .
throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . ants play .
maybe you did n't know that .
but when they 're playing , they 're learning the social order and dynamics of things .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
kittens play . we all know kittens play .
but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
they can still hunt , but they ca n't be social .
bears play .
but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better .
it 's the ones that play more .
and a final really interesting study — it 's been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
yours truly : humans .
kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
it 's a universal thing — we play .
and it 's not just kids , it 's adults too .
really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
and who are the biggest neotenists ?
humans . we play sports .
we do it for fun , or as olympians , or as professionals .
we play musical instruments .
we dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
we 're designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
we 're designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
it is a huge benefit .
just like there 's benefits to animals , there 's benefits to humans .
for example , it 's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
it 's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
as a result , what happens ?
we develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
we develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
these guys are facts .
it 's not fiction , it 's not story tales , it 's not make-believe ; it 's cold , hard science .
these are the benefits to play .
it is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
and if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
we hold ourselves back .
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
what does this world look like ?
it 's pretty bleak .
it 's pretty glum .
now imagine your workplace .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we 're forward thinking .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
or is it crap ? is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work .
`` `` oh , my colleagues see me laughing . i must not have enough work , '' or , `` '' oh , i 've got to hide because my boss might see me . ''
`` he 's going to think i 'm not working hard . '' '' but i have news for you : our thinking is backwards . ''
the opposite of play is not work . the opposite of play
is depression . it 's depression .
in fact , play improves our work .
just like there 's benefits for humans and animals , there 's benefits for play at work .
for example , it stimulates creativity .
it increases our openness to change .
it improves our ability to learn .
it provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
so before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play does n't mean frivolous .
you know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he 's serious about it , but he loves it .
he 's having fun , he 's in the groove , he 's in the flow .
a doctor might be serious , but laughter 's still a great medicine .
our thinking is backwards .
we should n't be feeling guilty .
we should be celebrating play .
quick example from the corporate world .
fedex , easy motto : people , service , profit .
if you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they 're happier , they 're fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
what happens ? they give better service — not worse , but better .
and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? they feel great .
and what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
people , service , profit .
play increases productivity , not decreases .
`` and you 're going to say , `` '' gee , that can work for fedex out there in the united states , but it ca n't work in bulgaria . ''
`` no way . we 're different . '' '' it does work in bulgaria , you guys . two reasons . ''
one , play is universal .
there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we ca n't play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
two , i 've tried it . i 've tried at sciant .
when i got there , we had zero happy customers .
not one customer would refer us .
i asked them all .
we had marginal profit — i did .
we had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
i do n't care when you get in in the morning . i do n't care when you leave .
i care that your customer and your team is happy and you 're organized with that .
why do i care if you get in at nine o'clock ?
basically promoting fun .
through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
`` and you can say , `` '' well how do you know they 're happy ? '' '' well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business . ''
independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
it does , and it can , work in bulgaria .
there 's nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
so some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
first of all , you have to believe me .
if you do n't believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
second of all , if you do n't have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you 've got that promotion you ca n't enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
i do n't care if it 's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
rediscover that because you 're the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
you 're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
you guys have to , and if you 're not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , are n't going to feel it .
`` you 've got to go back and say , `` '' hey , i 'm going to trust you . '' '' weird concept : i hired you ; i should trust you . ''
i 'm going to let you make decisions . i 'm going to empower you , and i 'm going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism .
i 'm going to let you challenge authority .
because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
we 're not always right as leaders .
we 're going to eradicate fear .
fear is the enemy of play .
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
let them be on the internet .
let them be on instant messengers .
let them take long lunches .
lunch is like the recess for work .
it 's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you would n't have had before .
let them do it . give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . let them have fun at the workplace .
`` we spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it 's supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , `` '' is this it ? ''
`` is that all there was ? '' '' unacceptable . nepriemliv . ''
( laughter ) so in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we do n't need a workers ' revolution .
we do n't need a workers ' revolution .
what we need is a players ' uprising . what we need is a players ' uprising . what we need is a players ' uprising .
seriously , we need to band together . today is the start of the uprising . but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
because we ca n't do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bulgaria for the better .
thank you .
( applause )
so i want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
but before i give it away , i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you 're doing with your body .
so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
sometimes we spread out . ( laughter ) i see you .
so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right now .
so , we 're really fascinated with body language , and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language .
you know , we 're interested in , like , you know — ( laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
narrator : here they are arriving at number 10 .
even the bbc and the new york times .
so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it 's language , so we think about communication .
when we think about communication , we think about interactions .
and there 's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
for example , nalini ambady , a researcher at tufts university , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician 's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
if you use them poorly , bad idea . right ?
we are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
so what nonverbals am i talking about ?
i 'm a social psychologist . i study prejudice , and i teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics .
i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
so in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
so you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you 're basically opening up .
it 's about opening up .
this expression , which is known as pride , jessica tracy has studied .
we make ourselves small .
and this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
so if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . we do n't mirror them .
so i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do i notice ?
when they sit down , they 're sort of spread out .
you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . as soon they come in , you see it .
i notice a couple of things about this .
so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
and this is really important in the mba classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
so i started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they 're participating .
there 's some evidence that they do .
so , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we 're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
so it goes both ways .
so the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
and when i say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am i talking about ?
so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
so powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance .
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
but really , power is also about how you react to stress .
so do you want the high-power leader that 's dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
probably not , right ?
so we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
here are a couple more .
so you can be standing or you can be sitting .
and here are the low-power poses .
so you 're folding up , you 're making yourself small .
when you 're touching your neck , you 're really protecting yourself .
so this is what happens .
that 's it . that 's the whole experiment .
here 's what we find on testosterone .
so again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
here 's what you get on cortisol .
so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
also , our bodies change our minds .
and so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
again , this is not about you talking to other people .
it 's you talking to yourself .
so that 's what we want to test . okay ?
it 's five minutes long . they are being recorded .
so for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
people hate this .
we then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
they 're blind to the hypothesis . they 're blind to the conditions .
it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech .
these kinds of things .
so this is what 's driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
so i said , fake it till you make it .
i do n't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
i do n't want to feel like an impostor .
when i was 19 , i was in a really bad car accident .
i was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
i was thrown from the car .
i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart , and i had been called gifted as a child .
so i 'm taken out of college , i keep trying to go back .
`` they say , `` '' you 're not going to finish college . ''
i am an impostor .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
`` like , i have become this . i am actually doing this . ' '' '' so that 's what i did . ''
i do n't feel that anymore , but she does , and i get that feeling .
like , she can fake it , she can become it .
so she had changed .
and so i want to say to you , do n't fake it till you make it .
fake it till you become it .
do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
the last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
so , this is two minutes .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
that 's what you want to do .
get your testosterone up . get your cortisol down .
do n't leave that situation feeling like , oh , i did n't show them who i am .
thank you .
great creativity . in times of need , we need great creativity .
discuss . great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
( laughter ) great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ai n't necessarily so .
great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
it can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
it 's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . and now we need that magic .
this is a time of need .
our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
and great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
here is one such scrap from an initiative i 'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
( video ) man : you know , rather than drive today , i 'm going to walk .
narrator : and so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
a deer with an itchy leg . a flying motorcycle .
a father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
and then he stopped . walking in front of him was her .
the woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
sure , she had aged a little .
in fact , she had aged a lot .
but he felt all his old passion for her return .
`` `` '' ford , '' '' he called softly . for that was her name . ''
`` `` '' do n't say another word , gusty , '' '' she said , for that was his name . ''
`` `` '' i know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here . ''
`` let 's go there and make love . in the tent . '' '' ford undressed . she spread one leg , and then the other . ''
gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
the earth moved for both of them .
and they lived together happily ever after .
and all because he decided to walk that day .
( applause ) andy hobsbawm : we 've got the science , we 've had the debate .
the moral imperative is on the table .
great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
to make it connect . to make it make people want to act .
so this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented ted community .
let 's get creative against climate change .
and let 's do it soon . thank you .
( applause )
beau lotto : so , this game is very simple .
all you have to do is read what you see . right ?
so , i 'm going to count to you , so we do n't all do it together .
okay , one , two , three.audience : can you read this ?
bl : amazing . what about this one ? one , two , three.audience : you are not reading this .
bl : all right . one , two , three . ( laughter ) if you were portuguese , right ? how about this one ? one , two , three .
audience : what are you reading ?
bl : what are you reading ? there are no words there .
i said , read what you 're seeing . right ?
`` it literally says , `` '' wat ar ou rea in ? '' '' ( laughter ) right ? ''
that 's what you should have said . right ? why is this ?
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
right ? the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what 's there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
all right ? which means , when it comes to perception , we 're all like this frog .
( laughter ) right ? it 's getting information . it 's generating behavior that 's useful . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( video ) man : ow ! ow ! ( laughter ) ( applause ) bl : and sometimes , when things do n't go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
but we 're talking about perception here , right ?
and perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before .
but actually , it 's a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
now , i want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
they begin with a question .
the problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it 's evolutionarily a bad thing . if you 're not sure that 's a predator , it 's too late .
okay ? ( laughter ) even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving . your eyes , because it 's moving in register with the boat , say i 'm standing still .
your brain can not deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
`` the question `` '' why ? '' '' is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty . ''
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
so how can we ever do anything new ? well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
and it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
they 're the ones that question the things we think to be true already . right ?
it 's easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
so what is evolution 's answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
it 's play .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes play fun .
right ? it 's adaptable to change . right ? it opens possibility , and it 's cooperative . it 's actually how we do our social bonding , and it 's intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
it 's actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
so armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
and who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
because they 're experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right ?
the first step was to ask a question .
now , i should say that we did n't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children could n't make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids could n't do it .
so we did it anyway . right ? of course .
so , here are some of the questions . i put them in small print so you would n't bother reading it . point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . right ?
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
she was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . right ? she will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted . right ?
now , science and asking questions is about courage .
now she is the personification of courage , because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all .
so amy , would you please come up ? ( applause ) ( applause ) so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project , and first she 's going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
amy o'toole : thank you , beau . we thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
but we wondered if there 's a possible link with other animals . it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . so what if bees can think like us ?
well , it 'd be amazing , since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
but it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( applause ) bl : so the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . so the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
ao : the puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
we asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern .
they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . the interesting question is , which ?
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
it was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( laughter ) bl : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing , because that 's what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . okay ?
so i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students doing the observations . they 're recording the data of where the bees fly .
( video ) dave strudwick : so what we 're going to do —student : 5c .
dave strudwick : is she still going up here ? student : yeah .
dave strudwick : so you keep track of each.student : henry , can you help me here ?
`` bl : `` '' can you help me , henry ? '' '' what good scientist says that , right ? ''
student : there 's two up there .
and three in here .
bl : right ? so we 've got our observations . we 've got our data .
they do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc. , etc .
and now we want to share . that 's the next step .
so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . right ? so we have to write it up .
so we go , of course , to the pub . all right ? ( laughter ) the one on the left is mine , okay ? ( laughter ) now , i tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
the introduction says , what 's the question and why ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
and the discussion is , who cares ? right ?
that 's a science paper , basically . ( laughter ) so the kids give me the words , right ? i put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
`` it 's not written by me . it 's written by amy and the other students in the class . as a consequence , this science paper begins , `` '' once upon a time ... `` '' ( laughter ) the results section , it says : `` '' training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . '' '' right ? ( laughter ) and the methods , it says , `` '' then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , '' '' smiley face . right ? ( laughter ) this is a science paper . we 're going to try to get it published . ''
so here 's the title page . we have a number of authors there .
all the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
`` the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be `` '' blackawton et al , '' '' and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this . ''
`` larry maloney , expert in vision , says , `` '' the paper is magnificent . ''
`` the work would be publishable if done by adults . '' '' so what did we do ? we send it back to the editor . ''
they say no .
so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to biology letters .
and there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . okay ? ( applause ) ( applause ) it took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( laughter ) typical science , actually , right ? so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
what was the feedback like ?
well , it was published two days before christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
it was the editors ' choice in science , which is a top science magazine .
it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters .
it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by biology letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
and i 'll just read one .
`` `` '' i have read 'blackawton bees ' recently . i do n't have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now . ''
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
who else can have these qualities more than children ?
`` please congratulate your children 's team from my side . '' '' so i 'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor . ''
can i do it on you ? ( laughter ) oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . yeah yeah . okay .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( laughter ) for me , not for him . right ? because we 've only done this once before . ( laughter ) and you like technology , right ?
shimon schocken : right , but i like myself .
bl : this is the epitome of technology . right . okay .
now ... ( laughter ) okay . ( laughter ) now , we 're going to do a little demonstration , right ?
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . all right ?
( clapping ) ( clapping ) okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . one , two , three ?
audience : ( shouts ) ( laughter ) ( shouts ) ( laughter ) brilliant . now , open your eyes . we 'll do it one more time .
everyone over there shout . ( shouts ) where 's the sound coming from ? ( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) what 's the point ? the point is what science does for us .
right ? we normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . when he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
that 's what science offers us . it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i 've asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
so , amy ?
ao : this project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and i mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
but changing the way i thought about science was surprisingly easy . once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , i then realized that science is n't just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of beau , and the blackawton bee project .
thank you.bl : thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
what i 'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
`` i 'm not going to talk about `` '' the skeptical environmentalist '' '' — probably that 's also a good choice . ''
( laughter ) but i am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i 'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
so get out your pen and paper .
bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
i 'm just going to list some of them .
there are 800 million people starving .
there 's a billion people without clean drinking water .
two billion people without sanitation .
there are several million people dying of hiv and aids .
the lists go on and on .
there 's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
there are many , many problems out there .
in an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we do n't .
we do n't actually solve all problems .
and if we do not , the question i think we need to ask ourselves — and that 's why it 's on the economy session — is to say , if we do n't do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
and that 's the question i 'd like to ask you .
if we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
we identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and i will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
we believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
the obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
where should we start on solving these problems ?
but that 's a wrong problem to ask .
that was actually the problem that was asked in davos in january .
but of course , there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
because we ca n't solve problems .
surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
but we do n't have a technology to solve that , right ?
so the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
and that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
to climate change that would be like kyoto .
to communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
to conflicts , it would be u.n. 's peacekeeping forces , and so on .
the point that i would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and i know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
and also — and that 's , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
what should be at the bottom of the list ?
please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues .
the amazing part of this process — and of course , i mean , i would love to — i only have 18 minutes , i 've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
i 'd love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that 's actually what we did .
and i also strongly encourage you , and i 'm sure we 'll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
of course , you have to ask yourself , why on earth was such a list never done before ?
and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
nobody wants to do this .
of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
and since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
we 've had the u.n. for almost 60 years , yet we 've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
so it does n't mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that 's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
so what i 'm proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we 've had a menu of choices .
there are many , many things we can do out there , but we 've not had the prices , nor the sizes .
we have not had an idea .
imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
you know , you have a pizza ; you 've no idea what the price is .
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
it could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
we 'd like to know these things .
and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
and so basically , this has been the copenhagen consensus ' process .
we got 30 of the world 's best economists , three in each area .
so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change .
what can we do ? what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
likewise in communicable diseases .
three of the world 's top experts saying , what can we do ?
what would be the price ?
what should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
and so on .
then we had some of the world 's top economists , eight of the world 's top economists , including three nobel laureates , meet in copenhagen in may 2004 .
`` we called them the `` '' dream team . '' '' the cambridge university prefects decided to call them the real madrid of economics . ''
that works very well in europe , but it does n't really work over here .
and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
and then you ask , why economists ?
and of course , i 'm very happy you asked that question — ( laughter ) — because that 's a very good question .
the point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
if you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you ca n't ask either of them , because that 's not what they do .
that is what economists do .
they prioritize .
they make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
so this is the list , and this is the one i 'd like to share with you .
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we 'll also talk about it more , i 'm sure , as the day goes on .
they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
then there 's fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
and of course , it 's the very good projects we should start doing .
i 'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
these were the bad projects .
as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
this offends a lot of people , and that 's probably one of the things where people will say i should n't come back , either .
and i 'd like to talk about that , because that 's really curious .
why is it it came up ?
and i 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto — or doing something more than kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient .
it 's not saying that global warming is not happening .
it 's not saying that it 's not a big problem .
but it 's saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
what they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
that 's a substantial amount of money .
that 's two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year .
yet it would do very little good .
all models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
which is a little good , but not very much good .
so the idea here really is to say , well , we 've spent a lot of money doing a little good .
and just to give you a sense of reference , the u.n. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
we could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
so we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
and that is really why it becomes a bad project .
it 's not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we would n't want to do it .
but it 's to say , when we do n't , it 's just simply not our first priority .
the fair projects — notice i 'm not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
it would do a lot of good , but it 's also very , very costly .
again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
if you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
so i 'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
the fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of [ million ] people get infected every year .
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations .
if we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
we could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected every year .
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
this third best one was free trade .
basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the u.s. and europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the third world .
again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
that would be the third best thing we could do .
the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
not just malnutrition in general , but there 's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
basically , about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin a .
if we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
that would be the second best investment that we could do .
and the very best project would be to focus on hiv/aids .
basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of hiv/aids .
again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv/aids .
one is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
and again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
but in a world where we do n't do either , or do n't do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
and treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
so basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do x amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
i 'd like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
i find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
we should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it 's such a big problem .
but of course , we do n't do all problems .
there are many problems out there in the world .
and what i want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
and i think , actually — thomas schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
one of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we 're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u.n .
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
and of course , we 'll be even richer than that .
but the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in bangladesh in 2100 , we 're not talking about a poor bangladeshi .
we 're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy .
and so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich dutch guy ?
or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
`` or as schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich chinese , a rich bolivian , a rich congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , `` '' how odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? '' '' so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight . ''
even if it does n't accord to the typical way we see this problem .
of course , that 's mainly because climate change has good pictures .
`` we have , you know , `` '' the day after tomorrow '' '' — it looks great , right ? ''
it 's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it , right , but do n't expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something . ( laughter ) it just does n't make for as much of a movie .
so in many ways , i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
to make sure that we realize it 's not about making us feel good .
it 's not about making things that have the most media attention , but it 's about making places where we can actually do the most good .
the other objections , i think , that are important to say , is that i 'm somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — i would certainly agree .
i think we should do all things , but we do n't .
in 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
since then our aid has halved .
so it does n't look like we 're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
likewise , people are also saying , but what about the iraq war ?
you know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why do n't we spend that on doing good in the world ?
i 'm all for that .
if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that , that 's fine .
but the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , do n't we ?
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
i should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
you know , when you ask the world 's best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white american men .
and they 're not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
so we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
the majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
we 've done this many other times .
there 's been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
they all come out with very much the same list .
and that gives me great hope , really , in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
of course , in an ideal world , again we 'd love to do everything .
but if we do n't do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
i see the copenhagen consensus as a process .
we did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
`` to start thinking about saying , `` '' let 's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we do n't know how to do , but let 's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . '' '' at the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there 's some things we do , there are other things we do n't do . ''
if we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
so i hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
thank you .
the year is 1800 .
a curious little invention is being talked about .
it 's called a microscope .
what it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an english mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . this is from london .
fast forward 200 years .
we still have this monster soup around , and it 's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
now it 's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
you take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
they all have faces .
why is that so , that alex in kenya , fatima in bangladesh , navjoot in mumbai , and julie and mary in uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
and that 's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
and remember that number : one billion .
the problem lies with the microscope itself .
even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
they are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
this picture is mahatma gandhi in the '40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t.b . in his ashram in sevagram in india .
two of my students , jim and james , traveled around india and thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
we saw all kinds of donated equipment .
we saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
and we saw people who had a functional microscope but just did n't know how to even turn it on .
what grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call foldscopes .
so what is a foldscope ?
a foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
so , now you think , how is that possible ?
i 'm going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
it starts with a single sheet of paper .
what you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
so , there are three stages : there is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
and there are micro optics at the bottom that 's actually embedded in the paper itself .
what you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , i tab it off , and i break it off .
this paper has no instructions and no languages .
there is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
when it 's done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an xy stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
we did n't want to change this , because this is the standard that 's been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
so this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
you pop this in .
there is an xy stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that 's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
so what 's really interesting about this object , and my students hate when i do this , but i 'm going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
i can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
and they last , even though they 're designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope i have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
and i 'm going to pick one randomly .
this one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
so the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
so up till now , you did n't actually see what i would see from one of these setups .
so what i would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
i have these two microscopes that i 'm going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what i would see .
what you 're looking at — ( applause ) — this is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when i 'm going to zoom in closer , right there , i am going through the z-axis .
another example , one of my favorite insects , i love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you 're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
right there .
all from the simple setup that i actually described .
so my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever i forget them in the dryer .
so it turns out they 're waterproof , and — ( laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and i do n't know if you can actually see this .
this also shows you how the projection scope works .
you get to see the beam the way it 's projected and bent .
can we get the lights back on again ?
so i 'm quickly going to show you , since i 'm running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
( applause ) and what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
i 'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
here is a sheet of paper .
this is when we were thinking about the idea .
this is an a4 sheet of paper .
these are the three stages that you actually see .
and the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
so that 's where the lenses go .
there are some light sources .
and essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
so even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
so here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if i was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
there it is , and it survives .
so for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
we are starting at the end of the summer .
we are at a stage where we 'll be making thousands of microscopes .
that would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
we 've started collecting data for malaria , chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
and i want to leave you with this picture .
i had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
what are the tools that we 're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
i would love for them to be able to just print out a foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
thank you .
( applause )
our world has many superheroes .
and this is how i first met these marginalized superheroes .
but at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
so , the thing is , i plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
and then i realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to brazil .
i met them in argentina , chile , bolivia , south africa , turkey and even in developed countries such as the united states and japan .
( applause ) .
catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , podiatrists , hair stylists , massage therapists and much more .
then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
( applause ) .
about a year and a half ago , stephen lawler , who also gave a talk here at ted in 2007 on virtual earth , brought me over to become the architect of bing maps , which is microsoft 's online-mapping effort .
in the past two and a half , we 've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you 're familiar at all with seadragon , that 's where it comes from .
mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it 's also about imagery .
so , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city , all the facades .
now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map 's directions are really just one of them .
if you click on this , you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out , just in the past couple of months since we 've launched .
so , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
this wonderful one which i do n't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
it 's wonderful .
but i 'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
so , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
i 'm not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
everything that 's cased in blue is an area where we 've taken imagery on the ground as well .
now , i 'll show you a fun app that — we 've been working on a collaboration with our friends at flickr .
this takes flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — i 'm not sure if that 's the one i actually meant to pull up , but — ( laughter ) but notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
so this one was taken around five .
so that 's the flickr photo , that 's our imagery .
so you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
and i 'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
but what 's cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that 's something that i 'll be showing you more of in just a moment .
now i just made a transition indoors . that 's also interesting .
ok , notice there 's now a roof above us .
we 're inside the pike place market .
and this is something that we 're able to do with a backpack camera , so , we 're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we 're also imaging inside .
and from here , we 're able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
so this is something that we 're now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
( laughter ) ok .
( ringing ) all right , guys , are you there ?
( noise ) all right . i 'm hitting it . i 'm punching play .
i 'm live . all right . there we go .
so , these are our friends in pike place market , the lab .
( applause ) so they 're broadcasting this live .
ok , george , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
because i want to show points of interest .
no , no . the other way .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
i do n't want to see you guys yet .
ok , ok , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
ok , never mind .
what i wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you 're actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
what the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
( laughter ) we 're doing two different — ok , i 'm hanging up now .
we 're doing two different things here .
one of them is to take that real ...
( laughter ) all right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
they 've done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
( applause ) i 'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
and while i walk outside , i 'll just mention that here we 're using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
when you use it on the spot , it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
so here , we 're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
that was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4g network from the market .
all right , and now there 's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years .
and that 's curtis wong , worldwide telescope .
so , we 're going to head over to the dumpsters , where it 's traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
this is the integration of worldwide telescope into our maps .
( applause ) this is the current — thank you — this is the current time . if we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
so , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth .
all right now , i 've overrun my time , so i 've got to stop .
thank you all very much .
( applause )
i 'm going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
and let me start with this .
this is my baseline : this is the mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
something like this is what i first saw when i jumped in the water for the first time in the mediterranean coast off spain .
now , if an alien came to earth — let 's call him joe — what would joe see ?
if joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
very unlikely , joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
so , probably , what joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
and where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
and this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
this is their baseline . this is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
so i 'm going to get us all on a time machine , and we 're going to the left ; we 're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
and let 's start with this time machine , the line islands , where we have conducted a series of national geographic expeditions .
this sea is an archipelago belonging to kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
so let 's start with the first one : christmas island , over 5,000 people .
most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
we did n't see a single shark .
this is the place that captain cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
let 's move the dial a little bit to the past .
fanning island , 2,500 people .
the corals are doing better here . lots of small fish .
this is what many divers would consider paradise .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
if we go back to a place like palmyra atoll , where i was with jeremy jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
you can see sharks in every single dive .
and this is something that is very unusual in today 's coral reefs .
but then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
what have we learned from these places ?
this is what we thought was natural .
this is what we call the biomass pyramid .
if we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
and then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
but this is a consequence .
this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
when we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like kingman reef , which is now protected .
the good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there 's more of everything .
the size of these boxes is bigger .
we have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
they clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
these have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
but still , now we have global warming .
if we do n't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
but the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
so how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during el nino , year '97 , '98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
in christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
in fanning island , the corals are not recovered .
but you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
and the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
and when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
these places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
the more intact , the more complete , [ and ] the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , [ and ] the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
and that 's good news , so we need to recover that structure .
we need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
so if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
well , there are several ways .
one very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
and let me go back to that image of the mediterranean .
this was my baseline . this is what i saw when i was a kid .
and at the same time i was watching jacques cousteau 's shows on tv , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
and i thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
but , little did i know , until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
so you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
and this particular place , the medes islands marine reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
so these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
so let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
these places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
the number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
this is very substantial .
the size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
the abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
and the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
in some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
so we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
they reproduce . that 's population biology 101 .
if you do n't kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
and same thing for invertebrates . this is the example .
these are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
outside the reserve , you can not even detect this .
one point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
so these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
this is in the bahamas : nassau grouper .
huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
so the fishermen are catching more .
you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
so there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . it is building resilience .
so what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
reserves are like savings accounts .
we have this principal that we do n't touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
and if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
this is how much fishermen get everyday in kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it 's a free-for-all .
once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
if you fish less , you 're actually catching more .
but if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
another example : nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef .
this is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of december and january for a week .
they used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
when i went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
and the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
so we did a simple analysis , and it does n't take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
and with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
it happened in many places around the caribbean .
and they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
so how much of this do we have ?
if this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
and you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean 's protected .
we 're getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the chagos archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
now , is this possible ? people would ask : how much would that cost ?
well , let 's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
a creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
so how can we do that ?
if it 's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why do n't we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
and how can we reach that goal ?
well , there are two ways of getting there .
the trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the chagos archipelago .
the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
and a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
but what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
well , there are three main reasons why we do n't have tens of thousands of small reserves : the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it 's small .
second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world do n't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . and the government does n't have enough resources .
which takes us to the third reason , why we do n't have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
ngos and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
so the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
first , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
it 's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts do n't depend on work from ngos or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the philippines and a few other places .
and third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
the philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
we really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
and i 'd like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
there has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
the stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
so let 's do that . thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you enric .
enric sala : thank you .
ca : that was a masterful job of pulling things together .
first of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
es : well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
the big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
that 's basically it .
the animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
they reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
so , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
they are like capacitors of the system .
ca : that 's very fascinating .
so , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
es : at least in the seas .
what we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
and on land , this can not work .
but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
we think this is universal .
but we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
ca : so the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
you 're saying we 're spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
it would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
if the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
we 've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
es : and then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
so again , one of the big solutions is have the world trade organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
ca : okay , so there 's a lot of examples that i 'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
so thank you for those numbers .
the last one 's a personal question .
a lot of the experience of people here who 've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
es : it is a spiritual experience .
we go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
but the best feeling is this biophilia that e.o . wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
and if it were not for these places that show hope , i do n't think i could continue doing this job .
it would be just too depressing .
ca : well , enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . thank you .
es : thank you very much .
so it 's 1995 , i 'm in college , and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence , rhode island to portland , oregon .
and you know , we 're young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
`` `` what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road ? '' ''
my friend looks at me totally blankly .
there 's actually a gentleman in the front row who 's doing a perfect imitation of her look .
`` ( laughter ) and i 'm like , `` '' you know , all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them . '' '' she just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what i 'm talking about . ''
and what i 'm talking about is this .
( laughter ) right , the famous chinese character for picnic area . ( laughter )
i 've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
in other words , as you heard chris say , i 've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
this might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
( laughter ) in fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
we get it in the abstract .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
the human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
but when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs i hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and i ca n't actually think of anything i 'm wrong about .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
we go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
i think this is a problem .
i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
so what i want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
and second , why it 's such a problem .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
one reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
so let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you 're right here : how does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
dreadful . thumbs down .
embarrassing . okay , wonderful , great .
dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they 're answers to a different question .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you 're wrong ?
( laughter ) realizing you 're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
i mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid chinese character mistake .
but just being wrong does n't feel like anything .
i 'll give you an analogy .
do you remember that loony tunes cartoon where there 's this pathetic coyote who 's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
in pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he 's a bird , he can fly .
but the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
and what 's funny — at least if you 're six years old — is that the coyote 's totally fine too .
he just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid-air .
that 's when he falls .
when we 're wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we 're like that coyote after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
you know , we 're already wrong , we 're already in trouble , but we feel like we 're on solid ground .
so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago .
it does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
( laughter ) so this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
i call this error blindness .
most of the time , we do n't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we 're wrong about something , until it 's too late .
but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
think back for a moment to elementary school .
you 're sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
this is not mine , by the way .
( laughter ) so there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
it 's the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
so by the time you are nine years old , you 've already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
and a lot of us — and i suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
right , mr. cfo , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
( laughter ) you 're all cfo , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
okay , so fine .
except that then we freak out at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong .
because according to this , getting something wrong means there 's something wrong with us .
so we just insist that we 're right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
so let me tell you a story .
a couple of years ago , a woman comes into beth israel deaconess medical center for a surgery .
beth israel 's in boston .
it 's the teaching hospital for harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
so this woman comes in and she 's taken into the operating room .
she 's anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
everything seems to have gone fine .
`` and she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , `` '' why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? '' '' well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one . ''
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
`` he said , `` '' for whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . '' '' ( laughter ) the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous . ''
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
and when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that 's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
so this is a huge practical problem .
but it 's also a huge social problem .
think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
and when you feel that way , you 've got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
it turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they 're ignorant .
they do n't have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team .
when that does n't work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they 're idiots .
( laughter ) they have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
and when that does n't work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
so this is a catastrophe .
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
but to me , what 's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
that is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
the miracle of your mind is n't that you can see the world as it is .
it 's that you can see the world as it is n't .
we can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it 's like to be some other person in some other place .
and we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
and yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
`` 1,200 years before descartes said his famous thing about `` '' i think therefore i am , '' '' this guy , st. augustine , sat down and wrote `` '' fallor ergo sum '' '' — `` i err therefore i am . '' ''
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
it 's totally fundamental to who we are .
because , unlike god , we do n't really know what 's going on out there .
and unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
to me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
last year , for various reasons , i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life .
and so i 'm listening and i 'm listening , and at some point , i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
`` and my first thought was , `` '' i 've lost it . ''
i 've become the crazy wrongness lady .
`` i just imagined it everywhere , '' '' which has happened . ''
but a couple of months later , i actually had a chance to interview ira glass , who 's the host of the show .
`` and i mentioned this to him , and he was like , `` '' no actually , that 's true . ''
`` in fact , '' '' he says , `` '' as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme . ''
`` and the crypto-theme is : 'i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . ' and the thing is , '' '' says ira glass , `` '' we need this . ''
`` we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . '' '' and for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up . ''
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
but , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .
and something else happened instead .
and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
and something else happened instead .
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
and something else happened instead .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
and something else happened instead .
( laughter ) i mean , this is life .
for good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
no offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
because half the stuff that 's the most mind-boggling and world-altering — ted 1998 — eh .
( laughter ) did n't really work out that way , did it ? ( laughter )
where 's my jet pack , chris ? ( laughter )
( applause ) so here we are again .
and that 's how it goes .
we come up with another idea .
we tell another story .
we hold another conference .
the theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
`` and to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , `` '' wow , i do n't know . ''
`` maybe i 'm wrong . '' '' thank you . ''
( applause ) thank you guys . ( applause )
on november 5th , 1990 , a man named el-sayyid nosair walked into a hotel in manhattan and assassinated rabbi meir kahane , the leader of the jewish defense league .
nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen new york city landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the united nations headquarters .
thankfully , those plans were foiled by an fbi informant .
sadly , the 1993 bombing of the world trade center was not .
nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
el-sayyid nosair is my father .
i was born in pittsburgh , pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an egyptian engineer , and a loving american mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
it was n't until i was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
my father exposed me to a side of islam that few people , including the majority of muslims , get to see .
it 's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it does n't take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
however , in every religion , in every population , you 'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
a few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on long island for target practice .
he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning .
we arrived at calverton shooting range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the fbi .
when it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off .
that day , the last bullet i shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone 's surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
`` my uncle turned to the other men , and in arabic said , `` '' ibn abuh . '' '' like father , like son . ''
they all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it was n't until a few years later that i fully understood what they thought was so funny .
they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the world trade center 's north tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
these were the men i looked up to .
these were the men i called ammu , which means uncle .
by the time i turned 19 , i had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood did n't really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
each time i would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
being the perpetual new face in class , i was frequently the target of bullies .
i kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
so for the most part , i spent my time at home reading books and watching tv or playing video games .
for those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , i was n't prepared for the real world .
i 'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person 's race or religion .
so what opened my eyes ?
one of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
through a college prep program , i was able to take part in the national youth convention in philadelphia .
my particular group 's focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which i felt particularly passionate .
the members of our group came from many different walks of life .
one day toward the end of the convention , i found out that one of the kids i had befriended was jewish .
now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and i realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
i had never had a jewish friend before , and frankly i felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life i had been led to believe was insurmountable .
another major turning point came when i found a summer job at busch gardens , an amusement park .
there , i was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
most of my life , i 'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
as chance would have it , i had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people i had ever met .
being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how i would want to be treated .
because of that feeling , i was able to contrast the stereotypes i 'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
i do n't know what it 's like to be gay , but i 'm well acquainted with being judged for something that 's beyond my control .
`` then there was `` '' the daily show . '' '' on a nightly basis , jon stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person 's race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one 's character . ''
he was in many ways a father figure to me when i was in desperate need of one .
inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
one day , i had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that i will hold dear to my heart for as long as i live .
`` she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime , and said , `` i 'm tired of hating people . '' ''
in that instant , i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
zak ebrahim is not my real name .
i changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
well , that 's simple .
i do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although i had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that i did not become fanaticized .
instead , i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
i do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
for the victims of terrorism , i will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father 's actions .
and with that simple fact , i stand here as proof that violence is n't inherent in one 's religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
i am not my father .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you , everybody . ( applause ) thank you all . ( applause ) thanks a lot . ( applause )
i 'm delighted to be here .
i 'm honored by the invitation , and thanks .
i would love to talk about stuff that i 'm interested in , but unfortunately , i suspect that what i 'm interested in wo n't interest many other people .
first off , my badge says i 'm an astronomer .
i would love to talk about my astronomy , but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter .
so i 'm not going to talk about that .
( laughter ) it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at lawrence berkeley labs .
and i caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb , and stealing information and selling it .
and i 'd love to talk about that — and it 'd be fun — but , 20 years later ...
i find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
it 's tedious .
i 'm — the first time you do something , it 's science .
the second time , it 's engineering .
a third time , it 's just being a technician .
i 'm a scientist . once i do something , i do something else .
so , i 'm not going to talk about that .
`` nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book , `` '' silicon snake oil , '' '' or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers do n't belong in schools . ''
i feel that there 's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
my idea is : no ! no !
get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
and i 'd love to talk about this , but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it does n't need much talking about — but i guess i may be very wrong about that , and everything else that i 've said .
so do n't go back and read my dissertation .
it probably has lies in it as well .
having said that , i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
( laughter ) and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
i 'm supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
oh , right . and my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because i 've got gray hair , and so , it 's kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be , if you really want to know about the future , do n't ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
no ! do n't ask somebody who 's writing code .
no , if you want to know what society 's going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
they know .
in fact , do n't ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
they 're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
i do n't . nor , i suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
but to me , things are n't the future .
what i ask myself is , what 's society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
but that 's not what i 'm going to talk about .
i 'd love to talk about it , it 'd be fun , but i want to talk about what i 'm doing now . what am i doing now ?
oh — the other thing that i think i 'd like to talk about is right over here . right over here .
is that visible ? what i 'd like to talk about is one-sided things .
i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
because i love mobius loops . i not only love mobius loops , but i 'm one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes klein bottles .
right away , i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
this is a klein bottle .
for those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , i know all about it .
it 's one sided . it 's a bottle whose inside is its outside .
it has zero volume . and it 's non-orientable .
it has wonderful properties .
if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
`` and i 'd love to talk to you about this , but i do n't have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( laughter ) ( chris anderson : i 've got a cold . ) however , the `` '' d '' '' in ted of course stands for design . ''
just two weeks ago i made — you know , i 've been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
but what i 've just made — and i 'm delighted to show you , first time in public here .
this is a klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it should n't be able to hold any fluid at all , it 's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
so it 's highly — that one 's the cool one .
that was a month of my life .
but although i would love to talk about topology with you , i 'm not going to .
( laughter ) instead , i 'm going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
could somebody put this guy up ?
and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
and i looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when i was working at the electronic music studio !
as a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at suny buffalo . and wow !
way back machine . and i said to myself , oh yeah !
and it sent me back .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
this guy over here of course is me .
this man is robert moog , the inventor of the moog synthesizer , who passed away this past august .
robert moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
a musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at suny buffalo .
he 'd come up from trumansburg to teach me not just about the moog synthesizer , but we 'd be sitting there — i 'm studying physics at the time . this is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
`` we 're studying physics , i 'm studying physics , and he 's saying , `` '' that 's a good thing to do . ''
`` do n't get caught up in electronic music if you 're doing physics . '' '' mentoring me . he 'd come up and spend hours and hours with me . ''
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
in the background , my bicycle .
i realize that this picture was taken at a friend 's living room .
bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this .
we sat around talking about fourier transforms , bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog .
( applause ) and i 'll just say what i 'm about to do . what i 'm about to do — i hope you can recognize that there 's a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
kids . kids is what i 'm going to talk about — is that okay ?
it says kids over here , that 's what i 'd like to talk about .
i 've decided that , for me at least , i do n't have a big enough head .
so i think locally and i act locally .
i feel that the best way i can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
so ph.d. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
`` and one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , `` well , how come you ai n't teaching ? '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' well , i 've taught graduate — i 've had graduate students , i 've taught undergraduate classes . '' '' no , they said , `` '' if you 're so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ai n't over here on the front lines ? ''
`` put your money where you mouth is . '' '' is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week . ''
not just showing up every now and then .
no , no , no , no , no . i take attendance .
i take lunch hour . ( applause ) this is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
not just show up to class every now and then .
teach a solid week . okay , i 'm teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
`` one of the things that i 've done for my science students is to tell them , `` '' look , i 'm going to teach you college-level physics . ''
no calculus , i 'll cut out that .
you wo n't need to know trig .
but you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we 're going to do serious experiments .
none of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
`` we 're going to be doing genuine physics . '' '' and that 's one of the things i thought i 'd do right now . ''
( high-pitched tone ) oh , before i even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
my students in el cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
we were off by 25 percent . how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
in addition to that , we 've measured the speed of sound .
i 'd love to measure the speed of light here .
`` i was all set to do it and i was thinking , `` '' aw man , '' '' i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light . ''
and i 'm all set to do it . i 'm all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
and there 's no time to do it .
so , next time , maybe , i 'll measure the speed of light !
but meanwhile , let 's measure the speed of sound !
well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
`` but , probably — one of my students , ariel [ unclear ] , said , `` could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? '' ''
and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
is a constant . when the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . so , if we have a wave here — over here , that 's what 's interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
right ? this is simple physics .
all of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
what they did n't tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and i wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
and that constant is the speed of sound .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all i 've got to do is know its frequency . well , that 's easy .
i 've got a frequency counter right here .
set it up to around a , above a , above a. there 's an a , more or less .
now , so i know the frequency .
it 's 1.76 kilohertz . i measure its wavelength .
all i need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
so anytime i talk , you 'd see it on the screen .
i 'll put it over here , and as i move this away from the source , you 'll notice the spiral .
the slinky moves . we 're going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
those of you who are physicists , i hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( laughter ) to measure the wavelength , all i need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
from here to here is the wavelength of sound .
so , i 'll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
i 've moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
ok , let 's go back to mr. elmo .
and we 'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
the wavelength was 0.2 meters .
let 's figure out what this is .
( laughter ) ( applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
if you look it up in the book , it 's really 343 .
but , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we 've been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . pretty good .
all of which comes to what i wanted to say .
go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
`` it was 1971 , the vietnam war was going on , and i 'm like , `` '' oh my god ! '' '' i 'm studying physics : landau , lipschitz , resnick and halliday . ''
i 'm going home for a midterm . a riot 's going on on campus .
there 's a riot ! hey , elmo 's done : off .
there 's a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
`` i 'm walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , `` you ! you 're a student . '' ''
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes by my head . whoosh !
i get a breath of tear gas and i ca n't breathe .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
he wants to clunk me over the head !
`` i 'm saying , `` '' i got to clear out of here ! '' '' i go running across campus quick as i can . i duck into hayes hall . ''
it 's one of these bell-tower buildings .
the cop 's chasing me .
chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
chases me into this room .
the entranceway to the bell tower .
i slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking .
`` and i 'm thinking , `` '' oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . '' '' ( laughter ) i keep climbing up , go back . ''
i go to a place where a dowel splits off .
there 's a clock , clock , clock , clock .
the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it .
i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity .
i climb up , and there 's this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
i pop up the top , and there 's a cupola .
a dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
i 'm looking out and i 'm seeing the cops bashing students ' heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
`` and i 'm asking , `` '' what am i doing here ? why am i here ? '' '' then i remember what my english teacher in high school said . ''
namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
so , i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and i look at it .
`` i 'm asking myself , `` '' why am i here ? '' '' so , at this time , i 'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells : `` '' all truth is one . ''
in this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
`` it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . '' '' thank you very much . ''
it 's for the number needed to treat .
good morning !
are you awake ?
they took my name tag , but i wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in arabic ?
anyone ! no one ? all right , no problem .
once upon a time , not long ago , i was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
`` so i looked at the waiter and said , `` do you have a menu ( arabic ) ? '' ''
he looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
`` he said , `` '' sorry ? ( english ) . '' '' i said , `` '' the menu ( arabic ) , please . '' '' he replied , `` '' do n't you know what they call it ? '' '' `` i do . '' ''
`` he said , `` '' no ! it 's called `` '' menu '' '' ( english ) , or `` '' menu '' '' ( french ) . '' '' is the french pronunciation correct ? ''
`` `` '' come , come , take care of this one ! '' '' said the waiter . ''
`` he was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , `` if this was the last girl on earth , i would n't look at her ! '' ''
`` what 's the meaning of saying `` '' menu '' '' in arabic ? ''
two words made a lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
how could she speak that way ?
at that moment , i started thinking .
it made me mad .
it definitely hurts !
i 'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
where could this happen ?
how did we get here ?
well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they 're modern and civilized .
should i forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
should i forget everything i learned in arabic , just to conform ?
to be one of them ?
where 's the logic in that ?
despite all that , i tried to understand him .
i did n't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
the arabic language does n't satisfy today 's needs .
it 's not a language for science , research , a language we 're used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely is n't a language we use at the airport .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
where can i use it , then ? we could all ask this question !
so , you want us to use arabic . where are we to do so ?
this is one reality .
but we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
arabic is the mother tongue .
research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
how ?
gibran khalil gibran , when he first started writing , he used arabic .
all his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
so , when he started writing in english , he had enough baggage .
even when he wrote in english , when you read his writings in english , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
you can imagine that that 's him writing in english , the same boy who came from the mountain . from a village on mount lebanon .
so , this is an example no one can argue with .
second , it 's often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
this is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
the germans , french , japanese and chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
that 's why they legislate to protect their language .
they make it sacred .
that 's why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
do we know better than them ?
all right , we are n't from the developed world , this advanced thinking has n't reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as turkey , malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
they kept it close to them .
because if you get any product from turkey or elsewhere and it 's not labeled in turkish , then it is n't a local product .
you would n't believe it 's a local product .
they 'd go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
so , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
`` if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( arabic ) , '' '' what does this remind you of ? ''
it does n't ring a bell , does it ?
regardless of the who , how and why .
language is n't just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
`` so when we say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence , '' '' each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period . ''
language is n't one , two or three words or letters put together .
it 's an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
what is our intellect ?
how do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
`` so , if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( english ) , '' '' or if your son came up to you and said , `` dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( english ) slogan ? '' ''
how would you feel ?
if you do n't see a problem , then i 'd better leave , and stop talking in vain .
the idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
i have a francophone friend who 's married to a french man .
i asked her once how things were going .
`` she said , `` '' everything is fine , but once , i spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni ' for him . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) the poor woman had mistakenly told him `` '' toqborni , '' '' and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him . ''
`` he was puzzled by the thought : `` '' how could anyone be this cruel ? ''
does she want to commit suicide ?
`` 'bury me ? ' ( english ) '' '' this is one of the few examples . ''
it made us feel that she 's unable to tell that word to her husband , since he wo n't understand , and he 's right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
`` she said to me , `` '' he listens to fairuz with me , and one night , i tried to translate for him so he can feel what i feel when i listen to fairuz . '' '' the poor woman tried to translate this for him : `` from them i extended my hands and stole you — '' ( laughter ) and here 's the pickle : `` and because you belong to them , i returned my hands and left you . '' ( laughter ) ''
translate that for me .
( applause ) so , what have we done to protect the arabic language ?
we turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the arabic language .
`` even though many people told me , `` '' why do you bother ? ''
`` forget about this headache and go have fun . '' '' no problem ! ''
`` the campaign to preserve arabic launched a slogan that says , `` i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west . '' ''
`` we did n't say , `` '' no ! we do not accept this or that . '' '' we did n't adopt this style because that way , we would n't be understood . ''
and when someone talks to me that way , i hate the arabic language .
we say— ( applause ) we want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
in a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
`` so , `` '' i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west '' '' has hit the spot . ''
something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
after that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
`` you 've seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with `` '' do n't kill your language ! '' '' written on it . ''
why ? seriously , do n't kill your language .
we really should n't kill our language .
if we were to kill the language , we 'd have to find an identity .
we 'd have to find an existence .
we 'd go back to the beginning .
this is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
after that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the arabic letter .
`` photos of `` '' cool '' '' guys and girls . ''
we are very cool !
`` and to whoever might say , `` '' ha ! you used an english word ! '' '' i say , `` '' no ! i adopt the word 'cool . ' '' '' let them object however they want , but give me a word that 's nicer and matches the reality better . ''
`` i will keep on saying `` '' internet '' '' i would n't say : `` '' i 'm going to the world wide web '' '' ( laughs ) because it does n't fit ! we should n't kid ourselves . ''
but to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we should n't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
creativity is the idea .
so , if we ca n't reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
at this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
let 's start from this moment .
let 's write a novel or produce a short film .
a single novel could make us global again .
it could bring the arabic language back to being number one .
so , it 's not true that there 's no solution ; there is a solution !
but we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
in conclusion , what can you do today ?
now , tweets , who 's tweeting ?
please , i beg of you , even though my time has finished , either arabic , english , french or chinese .
but do n't write arabic with latin characters mixed with numbers !
( applause ) it 's a disaster ! that 's not a language .
you 'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
it 's not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
that 's the first thing we can do .
second , there are many other things that we can do .
we 're not here today to convince each other .
we 're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
now i will tell you a secret .
a baby first identifies its father through language .
`` when my daughter is born , i 'll tell her , `` '' this is your father , honey ( arabic ) . '' '' i would n't say , `` '' this is your dad , honey ( english ) . '' '' and in the supermarket , i promise my daughter noor , that if she says to me , `` '' thanks ( arabic ) , '' '' i wo n't say , `` '' dis , 'merci , maman , ' '' '' and hope no one has heard her . ''
( applause ) let 's get rid of this cultural cringe . ( applause )
sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
the who and the why are what 's important to me .
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
i want to know how i impact them .
i want to know how they impact me .
i want to know why they fish .
i want to know how they rely on the water 's bounty for their living .
understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we 're also so fortunate to eat .
so what do we call this ?
i think we call it restorative seafood .
where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
it is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they 're a wonderful tool .
green , yellow and red lists [ of ] seafood species .
the association is very easy : buy green , do n't buy red , think twice about yellow .
but in my mind , it 's really not enough to just eat green list .
we ca n't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
but what if we eat only in the green list ?
you 've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
pole caught — no bycatch .
great for fishermen . lots of money . supporting local economies .
but it 's a lion of the sea . it 's a top predator .
what 's the context of this meal ?
am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
do i do this three times a week ?
i might still be in the green list , but i 'm not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
the point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
example : i 've heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
that 's great ! i love red wine !
i 'm going to drink so much of it . i 'm going to be so healthy .
well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
well folks , we have a protein problem .
we have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws , or by flipper , or the gordon 's fisherman , but rather , by the jolly green giant .
vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
well i 'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
we must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges .
it comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
whooo !
this is an easy sell .
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart .
jamie oliver is campaigning to save america from the way we eat .
sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
there 's a pattern here .
forget nuclear holocaust ; it 's the fork that we have to worry about .
we have ravaged our earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
and so i think it 's time we change what we expect from our food .
sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
so let 's start there .
there 's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution .
but green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
just because it comes from a green source does n't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
we have eco-friendly shrimp .
we can make them ; we have that technology .
but we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
it does n't work .
heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
while we try to manage declining marine populations , the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood .
studies say that tens of thousands of american grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
that 's a reward i am not willing to pass up .
but it 's not all about the seafood .
it 's about the way that we look at our plates .
as a chef , i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
a couple things happened .
i made more money .
people started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they were n't going to fill up on the entrees alone .
people spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
people got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
they got healthier . i made more money .
this is great .
environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
one of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
we were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
this is what we need to favor .
this is what the green list says .
but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
but what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that i was talking about earlier ?
well , if you must , i have a recipe for you .
it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
get a knife . cut it into four portions .
put it on four plates .
mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
i expect a lot from food .
i expect health and joy and family and community .
i expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
i remember well the meals of my childhood .
they were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
this is still how i largely eat today .
i get sick when i go to steakhouses .
i get the meat sweats .
it 's like a hangover from protein .
it 's disgusting .
but of all the dire news that you 'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
eat your vegetables .
it 's pretty straightforward .
so what are we looking for in a meal ?
well for health , i 'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
for joy , i 'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
for family , i 'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
for community though , we start at the very beginning .
there 's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
we 've seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
but it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it 's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
so if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
we need to savor vegetables .
we need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
and we need to save dinner .
thank you .
( applause )
hi . i am an architect .
i am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper tubes .
1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
it 's very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected , and also it 's very easy to waterproof , and also , because it 's industrial material , it 's also possible to fireproof .
then i built the temporary structure , 1990 .
this is the first temporary building made out of paper .
there are 330 tubes , diameter 55 [ centimeters ] , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
in case you 're finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( laughter ) so it 's very useful .
year 2000 , there was a big expo in germany .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
my goal of the design is not when it 's completed .
my goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
after , the building was recycled .
so that was the goal of my design .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
because i was so poor , i wanted to rent an office in paris , but i could n't afford it , so i decided to bring my students to paris to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves .
so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you . i had one big problem .
because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
that was the problem .
then i completed the pompidou center in metz .
it 's a very popular museum now , and i created a big monument for the government .
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
they have money and power .
those are invisible .
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
that is our profession , even historically it 's the same , even now we are doing the same .
so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
but i must say they are no longer natural disasters .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
that 's the responsibility of architects .
then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
so i thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
we can make it better .
so that is why i started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in rwanda , africa .
two tribes , hutu and tutsi , fought each other .
over two million people became refugees .
but i was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the u.n .
they 're so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , in the shelters built by the u.n. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
but over two million people cut trees .
it just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
that is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 u.s. dollars per unit .
we built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
and then , year afterward , 1995 , in kobe , japan , we had a big earthquake .
nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
and also i found out there 's many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
`` so i went there and also i proposed to the priests , `` why do n't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? '' ''
`` and he said , `` '' oh god , are you crazy ? ''
`` after a fire , what are you proposing ? '' '' so he never trusted me , but i did n't give up . ''
i started commuting to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
so i proposed to rebuild . i raised — did fundraising .
i made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , i used beer crates as a foundation .
i asked the kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which does n't go with the color of the paper tubes .
the color coordination is very important .
and also i still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( laughter ) so i remember it was so disappointing .
so during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
`` he said , `` '' as long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . '' '' so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church . ''
it was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
then , in taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now .
so this building became a permanent building .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
in 1999 , in turkey , the big earthquake , i went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
2001 , in west india , i built also a shelter .
in 2004 , in sri lanka , after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami , i rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages .
and in 2008 , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
in one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
it 's still used , even after the current earthquake in china .
in 2009 , in italy , l'aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
and this is a very interesting photo : former prime minister berlusconi and japanese former former former former prime minister mr. aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
and they are very kind , affording my model .
i proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because l'aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
so i proposed to the mayor , i 'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
`` he said , `` '' as long as you bring your money , you can do it . '' '' and i was very lucky . ''
mr. berlusconi brought g8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
year 2010 in haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it 's impossible to fly over , so i went to santo domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
this is what happened in japan two years ago , in northern japan .
after the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
but look at this . there 's no privacy .
people suffer mentally and physically .
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
however , some of the facility authority does n't want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it 's become more difficult to control them .
but it 's really necessary to do it .
they do n't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
look at this . even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so i thought , we have to make multi-story building because there 's no land and also it 's not very comfortable .
so i proposed to the mayor while i was making partitions .
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi .
he asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [ fields ] .
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
many of the people want to stay here forever .
i was very happy to hear that .
now i am working in new zealand , christchurch .
about 20 days before the japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of christchurch , was totally destroyed .
and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
so this is under construction .
and i 'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
what is going on in this baby 's mind ?
if you 'd asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he could n't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
in the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
so in some ways , we think that this baby 's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
let me give you just one example of this .
one thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby .
after all , one of the things that 's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel is n't actually exactly like what we think and feel .
anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
now the question is : how could we ask them ?
babies , after all , ca n't talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
what we did — betty rapacholi , who was one of my students , and i — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
now all of the babies , even in berkley , like the crackers and do n't like the raw broccoli .
( laughter ) but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
and she would act as if she liked it or she did n't .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and did n't like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
`` but half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , `` '' mmmmm , broccoli . ''
`` i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . '' '' and then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she 'd go , `` '' eww , yuck , crackers . ''
`` i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . '' '' so she 'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted . ''
we did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
`` and then she would simply put her hand out and say , `` can you give me some ? '' ''
so the question is : what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
on the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they could n't figure this out .
but then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
the first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we do n't always want the same thing .
and what 's more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds did n't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
and this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that 's actually demonstrated it .
the question you might ask though is : why do children learn so much ?
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
i mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
and actually in many ways , they 're worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there 's actually an answer .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there 's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
and crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food .
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
so they 're very , very good at pecking for grain , and they 're not much good at doing anything else .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
other creatures , like the crows , are n't very good at doing anything in particular , but they 're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
and of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
we 're smarter , we 're more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
my son is 23 .
( laughter ) and at least until they 're 23 , we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
all right , why would we see this correlation ?
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
and that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you 're going to be helpless .
`` so you do n't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , `` a slingshot or maybe a spear might work . which would actually be better ? '' ''
you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
and the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
so the idea is that we have this early period when we 're completely protected .
we do n't have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
and then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
so they 're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we 're production and marketing .
we have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they 're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we 're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that 's what they 're for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
and in fact , the baby 's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
but real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
and there 's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
they go out and test it against the evidence .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
and some 10 years ago , i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
so if you want to know what 's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , i think it actually looks something like this .
this is reverend bayes 's notebook .
so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
how could it be that children are doing statistics ?
so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector .
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
let me mention just one that we did with tumar kushner , my student .
if i showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
but actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you would n't ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
so we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
and sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
they 're just learning how to count .
but unconsciously , they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
and in studies we 've just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we 've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
so in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
`` when children do experiments we call it `` '' getting into everything '' '' or else `` '' playing . '' '' and there 's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program . ''
here 's one from cristine legare 's lab .
what cristine did was use our blicket detectors .
and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones did n't , and then she showed them an anomaly .
and what you 'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
( video ) boy : how about this ?
same as the other side .
alison gopnik : okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
( laughter ) boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
ag : okay , he 's got his experimental notebook out .
boy : what 's making this light up .
( laughter ) i do n't know .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
( laughter ) boy : oh , it 's because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
ag : okay , hypothesis two .
boy : that 's why .
oh .
( laughter ) ag : now this is his next idea .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
not working either .
boy : oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this does n't have electricity .
ag : okay , that 's a fourth hypothesis .
boy : it 's lighting up .
so when you put four .
so you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
ag : okay , there 's his fifth hypothesis .
now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
this is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
well , what 's it like to be this kind of creature ?
what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
and i think just the opposite is true .
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
now here 's what we know about how adult consciousness works .
and adults ' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
so what happens for adults is we decide that something 's relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
our consciousness of that thing that we 're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
so babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
but they 're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
and if you actually look in their brains , you see that they 're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts have n't come on yet .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they 're bad at not paying attention .
so they 're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that 's important .
that 's the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that we 've never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we 're in a new city for the first time .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
and by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you 've been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
it 's like being in love in paris for the first time after you 've had three double-espressos .
( laughter ) that 's a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning . ( laughter )
now it 's good to be a grownup .
i do n't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
it 's good to be a grownup .
we can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
but if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

i 'm going to share with you the story as to how i have become an hiv/aids campaigner .
and this is the name of my campaign : sing campaign .
in november of 2003 , i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela 's 46664 foundation — that is his hiv/aids foundation .
and 46664 is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island .
and that 's me with youssou n'dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
you can see the bars of the window there .
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
in that moment in time , mandela told the world 's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid rainbow nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i had n't realized that the hiv/aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
`` and so i committed — when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , `` '' this is going to be something that i have to talk about . ''
`` i have to serve . '' '' and so , subsequently i participated in every single 46664 event that i could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done . ''
everyone in the world respects nelson mandela , everyone reveres nelson mandela .
but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
i was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat , the founder of treatment action campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
i met him at a 46664 event .
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear now .
this is a tool — this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv , people who are living with hiv .
`` and in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt i say , `` '' yes , we can talk about this issue . ''
`` it does n't have to be in the closet . '' '' i became a member of treatment action campaign and i 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization . ''
it 's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are hiv-positive .
they work in the field .
they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
they have education programs .
they bring out the issues of stigma .
it 's quite extraordinary what they do .
and yes , my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in south africa .
so this is my sing campaign .
sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — i went to about 12 different countries .
here i am in oslo in norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in hong kong , trying to get people to raise money .
in johannesburg , i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really do n't quite know what the solutions are .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
this is in the scottish parliament .
i 've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .
and i was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
and once again , in edinburgh with the wonderful african children 's choir who i simply adore .
and it 's children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the aids virus .
i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe — he 's the director of unaids .
and i 'm very honored by the fact that michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a unaids ambassador .
and in this way , i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
it 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
this can happen .
and here i am with a pregnant woman , who is hiv positive and we 're smiling , both of us are smiling , because we 're very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to .
and her baby will receive pmtct , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic .
now , i just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about avelile .
this is avelile — she goes with me wherever i go .
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans .
avelile 's mother had hiv virus — she died from aids-related illness .
avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
and here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
at this point in her life , she 's suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .
we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
and we did n't know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we did n't know if she was going to survive .
so , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
five months later , we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .
and i 'm getting — the hairs on my — i do n't know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you .
this is the transformation that took place .
is n't it extraordinary ?
( applause ) that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile .
and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
so , i would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the millennium development goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-saharan africa — could you please stand up .
i think that 's fair to say , it 's almost everyone in the hall .
thank you very much .

fifty years ago in the old soviet union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
with it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
the rocket was huge .
and packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
on october 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
`` one of the russian scientists wrote at the time : `` '' we are about to create a new planet that we will call sputnik . ''
in the olden days , explorers like vasco da gama and columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
now we have the good fortune to open up space .
`` and it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . '' '' you 're watching snippets from `` '' sputnik , '' '' my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed . ''
it tells the story of sputnik , and the story of what happened to america as a result .
for days after the launch , sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
but just three days later , on a day they called red monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile .
all hell broke loose .
sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit america — historians say the equal of pearl harbor or 9/11 .
it provoked the missile gap .
it exploded an arms race .
it began the space race .
within a year , congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
for example , some here will remember this day , june 1958 , the national civil defense drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
or the gallup poll that showed that seven in 10 americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
for example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik .
support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa , and the internet , and , of course , nasa .
my feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
but it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for america .
`` `` '' sputnik '' '' will soon be released . ''
in closing , i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime tedster , jay walker .
and i 'd like to thank you all .
( applause ) .
thank you , chris .
so when my boy says , “what’s good with you son ? ” i just say , “i jus’ fall out wit dem people but i done ! ” and sometimes in class i might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “yo ! why dese books neva be about my peoples” yes , i have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals because i’m “articulate” but who controls articulation ?
`` this is not a promotion of ignorance this is a linguistic celebration that’s why i put `` '' tri-lingual '' '' on my last job application i can help to diversify your consumer market is all i wanted them to know and when they call me for the interview i’ll be more than happy to show that i can say : “what’s good” “whatagwan” and of course …“hello” because i’m “articulate” thank you .

good morning . so magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
as a cyber-magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
you 've probably all heard of google 's project glass .
it 's new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
so these are my illusion glasses .
they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype .
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
let me show you what i mean .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
all right . very significant mark .
and let 's put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let 's get started .
( music ) voice : system ready . acquiring image .
marco tempest : for those of you who do n't play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
the cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
there 's spring , summer , autumn and â voice : my favorite season is winter.mt : well yeah , mine too .
winter is like magic . it 's a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
there are 13 cards in each suit . ( music ) voice : each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
mt : so over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
voice : the moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
mt : there are two colors in a deck of cards .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
voice : marco , i did not know you could do that . ( laughter ) mt : and is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( music ) voice : if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
mt : oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
make a wish . ( blowing noise ) voice : do n't tell , or it wo n't come true .
mt : well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that i received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , i have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( applause ) voice : and who are these ? mt : ah , mischief-makers . watch .
wake up .
joker : whoa.mt : are you ready for your party piece ?
joker : ready ! mt : let me see what you 've got .
joker : presenting my pogo stick.mt : ah . watch out .
joker : whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( music ) mt : but today , i am performing for a different kind of audience .
i 'm performing for you .
voice : signed card detected.mt : well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? is it a 9-to-5 job ?
of course not ! you 've got to practice 24/7 .
i do n't literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) whoa .
well , to this , i just say , no no .
actually , in german , it 's nein nein . ( laughter ) magic is n't that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , do n't play for money .
( music ) voice : why not ? that 's a very good hand .
the odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
voice : i think you got your birthday wish.mt : and that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
and unlike anything else we 've just seen , virtual or not.voice : signed card detected .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
mt : bye bye . ( music ) thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
i 've been at mit for 44 years .
and the third is a little bit less obvious .
have they all agreed ? no , not completely .
i 'll buy it . i have so much money .
i have so much money , it takes me forever .
i grew up in bihar , india 's poorest state , and i remember when i was six years old , i remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
my brothers and i dug in , and that 's when my father came home .
he was livid , and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
later , i understood why my father got so upset .
those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
my father was responsible for building roads in bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
his was a lonely struggle , because bihar was also india 's most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , [ rather ] than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
and i experienced this most viscerally when i traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
and as i went village to village , i remember one day , when i was famished and exhausted , and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
i resolved to give back .
later , i joined the world bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
my initial work focused on uganda , where i focused on negotiating reforms with the finance ministry of uganda so they could access our loans .
but after we disbursed the loans , i remember a trip in uganda where i found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
it was bihar all over again .
bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work i did in uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of world war ii , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in new hampshire , usa , to establish the bretton woods institutions , including the world bank .
and that traditional approach to development had three key elements . first , transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
the first key shift is open knowledge .
you know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the u.s. , europe or the world bank .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the south .
they want to know how china lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
this is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling north to south , but south to south , and even south to north , with mexico 's oportunidades today inspiring new york city .
and just as these north-to-south transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
this is the second shift : open aid .
recently , the world bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
take geomapping . in this map from kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
in this manner , the world bank has now geomapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
this is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
and this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
from the arab spring to the anna hazare movement in india , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
so for instance , several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public .
but , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that 's public and a budget that 's accessible .
this is a public budget . ( laughter ) and as you can see , it 's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
to tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it 's more understandable to the public .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what 's exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
so in the philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , checkmyschool.org , or using sms , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
and the government is responsive . so for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the department of education in the philippines took swift action .
and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south , from the philippines to indonesia , kenya , moldova and beyond .
in dar es salaam , tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
this is what the map of tandale looked like in august , 2011. but within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
and what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
today , even bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
but , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
these are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
so for instance , today , in ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
these examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems i witnessed in uganda or that my father confronted in bihar .
two years ago , on april 8th , 2010 , i called my father .
it was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . he won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
he fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
these became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
today , i 'm inspired by these changes , and i 'm excited that at the world bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in uganda 20 years ago .
we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
we need to accelerate these shifts .
if we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in bihar , in uganda , and beyond .
we will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
so imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
that 's the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
most of these deaths are preventable , and that does n't just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases is n't some smart , new technological innovations .
it 's one of the world 's oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , sars , and most recently in the case of cholera and ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
it stops babies from dying .
handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children 's lives .
it can save over 600,000 children every year .
that 's the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
i think you 'll agree with me that that 's a pretty useful public health intervention .
so now just take a minute .
i think you need to get to know the person next to you .
why do n't you just shake their hands .
please shake their hands .
all right , get to know each other .
they look really pretty .
all right .
so what if i told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually did n't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( laughter ) they do n't look so pretty anymore , right ?
pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five do n't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
and the same way , we do n't do it when we 've got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it 's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
what is it ? is there no soap ?
actually , soap is available .
in 90 percent of households in india , 94 percent of households in kenya , you will find soap .
even in countries where soap is the lowest , like ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
so why is it ?
why are n't people washing their hands ?
why is it that mayank , this young boy that i met in india , is n't washing his hands ?
well , in mayank 's family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
his parents think sometimes it 's a precious commodity , so they 'll keep it in a cupboard .
they 'll keep it away from him so he does n't waste it .
on average , in mayank 's family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
what 's the result of that ?
children pick up disease in the place that 's supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
think about where you learned to wash your hands .
did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
i think behavioral scientists will tell you that it 's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
however , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
every second in asia and africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
many women in india will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from lifebuoy brand .
iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
it 's that belief , plus the scale of unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
think about it : marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
and actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
the profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
but it 's been happening for centuries : the lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in victorian england to actually combat cholera .
last week , i was in ghana with the minister of health , because if you do n't know , there 's a cholera outbreak in ghana at the moment .
a hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : it 's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they 're using it , because that 's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
i think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
the budget is not always there .
and when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
in short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
we have friends like usaid , the global public-private partnership for handwashing with soap , london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , plan , wateraid , that all believe for a win-win-win partnership .
win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
and most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
on october 15 , we will celebrate global handwashing day .
schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world 's most important public health intervention .
what 's required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
if you take our help a child reach 5 campaign , we 've created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them .
we 've had over 30 million views .
most of these discussions are still happening online .
i urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
i come from mali , one of the world 's poorest countries .
i grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
i trained in europe 's premier school of public health .
i think i 'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
( laughter ) ( applause ) nine years ago , i decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that i could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world 's best invention in public health : soap .
we run today the world 's largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
we 've reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
my team and i have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
it may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
without it , and without talking about it , we can not achieve the change that we need .
last week , my team and i spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
i 'm a mom . i ca n't imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
this one is from myanmar .
she had the most beautiful smile , the smile , i think , that life gives you when you 've had a second chance .
her son , myo , is her second one .
she had a daughter who passed away at three weeks , and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant , and that if soap is used before touching the babies , we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers .
and that 's what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that i can equip her with what 's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
and next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , do n't look far : buy her soap .
it 's the most beautiful invention in public health .
i hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like myo reach their fifth birthday .
thank you .
( applause )
these are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
they are the things the victims of genocide in bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
we are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
these items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
and it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
during the four years of conflict that devastated the bosnian nation in the early '90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when u.n. safe zones like srebrenica fell into the hands of the serb army .
the international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
as much as genocide is about killing .
it is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
there are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
there are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
these items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on european soil since the holocaust .
not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on csi .
these objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
i decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
as a storyteller , i like to give back to the community .
i like to move beyond raising awareness .
and in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
in all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
thank you very much .
( applause )
but that ca n't be right .
i am for chocolate donuts .
so i would like to show you something i 've been working on .
there 's a few things i learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
i would never have been that adventurous before i started my 30-day challenges .
it 's awful .
in fact , they 're a ton of fun .
( applause )
hi . so today , i 'd like to share some works in progress .
since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
so i 'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we 're looking for through each of the works .
so the first work is called the imperial monochromes .
a viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
( laughter ) so this is the sketch of the two states .
one is total chaos . the other is absolute order .
and we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
this also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
one is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , malevich 's abstract compositions .
so i 'm just going to take you to a video .
to give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
that 's about this much . and the smallest one is an a4 .
so a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
and after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
( laughter ) so here it appears as if it 's the viewer that 's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
so this brings me to a quieter , small work called handheld .
the viewer sees a piece of paper that 's mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it 's a blank a4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that 's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
the viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
so this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
so here i 'm going to show you two tandem clips .
one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
and you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
so we 've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
so here 's a video .
you have to imagine the other hand . it 's not there yet .
but to us , we 're sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there 's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
that sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
the next work is decoy .
this is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as i am .
it has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
so when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
so here is the first test scenario .
you see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
but the idea is that once it 's got the person 's attention , it 's no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
( laughter ) so this is the final fabricated body of the decoy .
it appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
and so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
the next work is an object , that 's also a kind of sound instrument .
in the shape of an amphitheater that 's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
so from where i 'm standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
they 're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
this means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
so when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
it could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
it could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
so to us , i think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that 's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
so the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but can not really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
so there 's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
it also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
so here if you see we 're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
so here 's a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
and here is a prototype .
so we ca n't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
okay , this is the last work . it 's called the framerunners .
it comes out of the idea of a window .
this is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it 's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
so we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that 's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
this grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
they 're also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
so in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
so we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they 're oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
so to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
these figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
so all these real life qualities that i talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with eth zurich to develop the first prototype .
so you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
so it 's really quite small .
you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
so imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
( laughter ) thank you .
( applause )
so in college , i was a government major , which means i had to write a lot of papers .
now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
so , you know — ( laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heavier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( laughter )
and i would want to do that like that .
that would be the plan .
i would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then i would kind of do this .
( laughter ) and that would happen every single paper .
but then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you 're supposed to spend a year on .
and i knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
it was way too big a project .
so i planned things out , and i decided i kind of had to go something like this .
this is how the year would go .
so i 'd start off light , and i 'd bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , i would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
how hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
no big deal , right ?
but then , the funniest thing happened .
those first few months ?
they came and went , and i could n't quite do stuff .
so we had an awesome new revised plan .
and then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
i thought that was the end of everything .
but a week later i get a call , and it 's the school .
`` and they say , `` '' is this tim urban ? '' '' and i say , `` '' yeah . '' '' and they say , `` '' we need to talk about your thesis . '' '' and i say , `` '' ok. '' '' and they say , `` it 's the best one we 've ever seen . '' ''
it was a very , very bad thesis . ( laughter )
`` i just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , `` this guy is amazing ! '' ( laughter ) ''
no , no , it was very , very bad .
anyway , today i 'm a writer-blogger guy .
i write the blog wait but why .
and a couple of years ago , i decided to write about procrastination .
my behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and i wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
now , i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
and to test this , i found an mri lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator , so i could compare them .
i actually brought them here to show you today .
i know that if you 're not a trained brain expert , it 's not that obvious , but just take a look , ok ?
( laughter ) now ...
here 's my brain .
( laughter ) there is a difference .
both brains have a rational decision-maker in them , but the procrastinator 's brain also has an instant gratification monkey .
now , what does this mean for the procrastinator ?
well , it means everything 's fine until this happens .
`` [ this is a perfect time to get some work done . ] [ nope ! ] so the rational decision-maker will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the monkey does n't like that plan , so he actually takes the wheel , and he says , `` '' actually , let 's read the entire wikipedia page of the nancy kerrigan/ tonya harding scandal , because i just remembered that that happened . ''
( laughter ) then — ( laughter ) then we 're going to go over to the fridge , to see if there 's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago .
after that , we 're going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with justin bieber 's mom .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' all of that 's going to take a while , so we 're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today . ''
`` sorry ! '' '' ( sigh ) now , what is going on here ? ''
the instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
he lives entirely in the present moment .
he has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only cares about two things : easy and fun .
now , in the animal world , that works fine .
if you 're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you 're a huge success !
( laughter ) and to the monkey , humans are just another animal species .
you have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked ok .
but , if you have n't noticed , now we 're not in tribal times .
we 're in an advanced civilization , and the monkey does not know what that is .
which is why we have another guy in our brain , the rational decision-maker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
we can visualize the future .
we can see the big picture .
we can make long-term plans .
and he wants to take all of that into account .
and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you 're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time .
that 's why there 's an overlap .
sometimes they agree .
but other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
and that 's when we have a conflict .
and for the procrastinator , that conflict tends to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place that 's entirely out of the makes sense circle .
i call it the dark playground .
( laughter ) now , the dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well .
it 's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
the fun you have in the dark playground is n't actually fun , because it 's completely unearned , and the air is filled with guilt , dread , anxiety , self-hatred — all of those good procrastinator feelings .
and the question is , in this situation , with the monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
and importantly , he 's the only thing the monkey is terrified of .
( laughter ) now , of course , i said yes .
it 's always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past .
( laughter ) ( applause ) but in the middle of all this excitement , the rational decision-maker seemed to have something else on his mind .
`` he was saying , `` '' are we clear on what we just accepted ? ''
do we get what 's going to be now happening one day in the future ?
as six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of ted decided to release the speakers .
and i opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
( laughter ) so the panic monster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system 's in mayhem . ( laughter )
and the monkey — remember , he 's terrified of the panic monster — boom , he 's up the tree !
and finally , finally , the rational decision-maker can take the wheel and i can start working on the talk .
now , the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
and this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastinator 's system .
it 's not pretty , but in the end , it works .
this is what i decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
when i did , i was amazed by the response .
literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
these are people who were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots and lots of phd students .
`` ( laughter ) and they were all writing , saying the same thing : `` i have this problem too . '' ''
but what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails .
these people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this monkey had done to them .
and i thought about this , and i said , well , if the procrastinator 's system works , then what 's going on ?
why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
well , it turns out that there 's two kinds of procrastination .
everything i 've talked about today , the examples i 've given , they all have deadlines .
but there 's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline .
so if you wanted a career where you 're a self-starter — something in the arts , something entrepreneurial — there 's no deadlines on those things at first , because nothing 's happening , not until you 've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum , get things going .
there 's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that do n't involve any deadlines , like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health , working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that is n't working .
now if the procrastinator 's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster , that 's a problem , because in all of these non-deadline situations , the panic monster does n't show up .
he has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of procrastination , they 're not contained ; they just extend outward forever .
and it 's this long-term kind of procrastination that 's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier , short-term deadline-based kind .
it 's usually suffered quietly and privately .
and it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness , and regrets .
and i thought , that 's why those people are emailing , and that 's why they 're in such a bad place .
it 's not that they 're cramming for some project .
it 's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator , at times , in their own lives .
the frustration is not that they could n't achieve their dreams ; it 's that they were n't even able to start chasing them .
so i read these emails and i had a little bit of an epiphany — that i do n't think non-procrastinators exist .
that 's right — i think all of you are procrastinators .
now , you might not all be a mess , like some of us , ( laughter ) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines , but remember : the monkey 's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines are n't there .
now , i want to show you one last thing .
i call this a life calendar .
that 's one box for every week of a 90-year life .
that 's not that many boxes , especially since we 've already used a bunch of those .
so i think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
we need to think about what we 're really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
we need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey .
that 's a job for all of us .
and because there 's not that many boxes on there , it 's a job that should probably start today .
well , maybe not today , but ...
( laughter ) you know .
sometime soon .
thank you .
there 's a man by the name of captain william swenson who recently was awarded the congressional medal of honor for his actions on september 8 , 2009 .
on that day , a column of american and afghan troops were making their way through a part of afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
the column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , captain swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
one of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
and what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a gopro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
it shows captain swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
they put him in the helicopter , and then you see captain swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
i saw this , and i thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
what is that ? that is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
there 's a love there , and i wanted to know why is it that i do n't have people that i work with like that ?
you know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
in business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
we have it backwards . right ?
so i asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
and my initial conclusion was that they 're just better people .
that 's why they 're attracted to the military .
these better people are attracted to this concept of service .
but that 's completely wrong .
what i learned was that it 's the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
`` i 've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and i asked them , `` '' why would you do it ? ''
`` why did you do it ? '' '' and they all say the same thing : `` because they would have done it for me . '' ''
it 's this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
so trust and cooperation are really important here .
the problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
`` i ca n't simply say to you , `` '' trust me , '' '' and you will . ''
i ca n't simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
it 's not how it works . it 's a feeling .
so where does that feeling come from ?
if you go back 50,000 years to the paleolithic era , to the early days of homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
nothing personal .
whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
and so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what i call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
and when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
there are inherent benefits to this .
it means i can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
if we do n't trust each other , if i do n't trust you , that means you wo n't watch for danger .
bad system of survival .
the modern day is exactly the same thing .
the world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
it could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
it could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
it 's sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
we have no control over these forces .
these are a constant , and they 're not going away .
the only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that 's where leadership matters , because it 's the leader that sets the tone .
when a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
i was flying on a trip , and i was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and i watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
he was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
so i said something .
`` i said , `` '' why do you have treat us like cattle ? ''
`` why ca n't you treat us like human beings ? '' '' and this is exactly what she said to me . ''
`` she said , `` '' sir , if i do n't follow the rules , i could get in trouble or lose my job . '' '' all she was telling me is that she does n't feel safe . all she was telling me is that ''
she does n't trust her leaders .
the reason we like flying southwest airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
it 's because they do n't fear their leaders .
you see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
when we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
the closest analogy i can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
if you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? what makes a great parent ?
we want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
great leaders want exactly the same thing .
they want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
charlie kim , who 's the ceo of a company called next jump in new york city , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
we would never do it .
then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
if you get a job at next jump , you can not get fired for performance issues .
in fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a c from school .
it 's the complete opposite .
this is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking ceos with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
it 's not the numbers .
it 's that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
they have violated this deep-seated social contract .
we know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
this is what so offends us , not the numbers .
would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to gandhi ?
how about a $ 250 million bonus to mother teresa ?
do we have an issue with that ? none at all . none at all .
great leaders would never sacrifice
the people to save the numbers .
they would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
bob chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the midwest called barry-wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
they needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
and bob refused .
you see , bob does n't believe in head counts .
bob believes in heart counts , and it 's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
and so they came up with a furlough program .
every employee , from secretary to ceo , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
they could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
but it was how bob announced the program that mattered so much .
he said , it 's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
they saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
and quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
people would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
leadership is a choice . it is not a rank .
i know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
they are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
and i know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
this is what a leader is .
i heard a story of some marines who were out in theater , and as is the marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
and when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that 's what happens .
we call them leaders because they go first .
we call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
we call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
`` they will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader 's vision comes to life , and when we ask them , `` '' why would you do that ? ''
`` why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? '' '' they all say the same thing : `` because they would have done it for me . '' ''
and is n't that the organization we would all like to work in ?
thank you very much .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
as a child , i discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
i learned this from my grandmother , dr. ruth tichauer , a jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the andes .
that is how i grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
so part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
i cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
`` during those trips , my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem : `` '' something hidden . go and find it . ''
go and look behind the mountains .
something lost behind the mountains .
`` lost and waiting for you . go ! '' '' in the coming years , i became a medical student . ''
one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
there 's a part of this problem i think i can solve — the part of this problem i have spent my life working on .
the problem starts during pregnancy .
the fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
at the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
if it does n't close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
it is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
but what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
as you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
video : ( baby crying ) when you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
to close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
one night , my friend malte , were camping in the amazon region .
the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
then came a moment of inspiration .
so we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
the holes in children 's hearts can be closed with it .
a coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
it maybe does n't look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
in this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
the coil then closes the hole .
after that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
in vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
the coil , if it works , can save lives .
i returned from germany to bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
with my wife and partner , dr. alexandra heath , we started to see patients .
after successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
but we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
and , the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition .
the hole in altitude patients is different , because the orifice between the arteries is larger .
most patients can not afford to be treated on time , and they die .
the first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in bolivia .
the search started again .
we went back to the drawing board .
after many trials , and with the help of my grandmother 's indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
for centuries , indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms , and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device .
we take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
it seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that does n't rust because it 's made of only one piece .
it can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
as you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
we have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
no open surgery was necessary .
( applause ) as doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal — if they do .
this is the child from before , after the procedure .
as you can see — ( applause ) as you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
from start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
that 's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
we are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
we lost the fear of creating something new .
the path , it 's not easy .
many obstacles arise all the time .
but we receive strength from our patients .
their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
so we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
we will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
we are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
this whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it , really : no child is left behind .
muchas gracias .
( applause )
so i grew up in limpopo , on the border of limpopo and mpumalanga , a little town called motetema .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
`` so as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , `` '' man , why does n't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you do n't have to bathe ? '' '' and i sat , and i was like , `` '' man , i would buy that , eh ? '' '' so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics . ''
over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
`` so after seeing these shocking statistics , i thought to myself , `` '' okay , even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that i do n't want to bathe , i at least need to do it to try to save the world . '' '' ( laughter ) so with my trusty little steed , my nokia 6234 cell phone — i did n't have a laptop , i did n't have internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour internet cafe — i did research on wikipedia , on google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — i did high school science — and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper , ''
and it looked like the kfc special spice , you know ?
so i was like , okay , so we 've got the formula ready .
now we need to get this thing into practice .
`` fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , i 'm the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( `` '' no more bathing ! '' '' ) — i ca n't say any more than that . ( laughter ) i had invented drybath , the world 's first bath-substituting lotion . ''
you literally put it on your skin , and you do n't have to bathe .
( laughter ) so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that 's ready to go to the market . it 's actually available on the market .
so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available .
one of the things we learned was that poor communities do n't buy products in bulk .
they buy products on demand . a person in alex does n't buy a box of cigarettes . they buy one cigarette each day , even though it 's more expensive .
so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets .
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
and the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
after creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath . ( laughter ) at least once a week .
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man 's lifesaver .
having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question i have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , i came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
what 's stopping you ? ( applause ) i 'm not done yet . i 'm not done yet .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
i 'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i did n't want to bathe . thank you .
( applause . )
five years ago , i was on a sabbatical , and i returned to the medical university where i studied .
i saw real patients and i wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since i became a management consultant .
there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent .
the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues i met , former friends from medical school , who i knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people i 'd ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
so with this focus on cost-cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
it 's a big part of the national budgets .
and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
in other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore do n't reach patients .
in several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
after all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
you choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
so , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
and ultimately , some physicians will say today that they do n't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
at bcg , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this ca n't be the right way of managing healthcare .
`` and so we took a step back and we said , `` what is it that we are trying to achieve ? '' ''
ultimately , in the healthcare system , we 're aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
we call this value-based healthcare .
on the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
this was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg .
on this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
when we started doing our research at bcg , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
you compare hospitals in a country , you 'll find some that are extremely good , but you 'll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
the differences were dramatic .
erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
now living in europe , he can choose to go to germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
you flip a coin . fifty percent risk . that 's quite a lot .
if he instead would go to hamburg , and to a clinic called the martini-klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
that 's a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
when we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
but you and i do n't know . we do n't have the data .
and often , the data actually does n't exist .
nobody knows .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
now , it does n't have to be that way . there is hope .
in the late '70s , there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
to the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
they all realized they had their individual way of operating .
`` they all argued that , `` '' my technique is the best , '' '' but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that . ''
`` so they said , `` '' we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what 's best . '' '' so they in fact spent two years debating , `` so what is quality in hip surgery ? '' ''
`` `` oh , we should measure this . '' `` no , we should measure that . '' ''
and they finally agreed .
and once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
since then , they publish every year .
once a year , they publish the league table : who 's best , who 's at the bottom ?
and they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
for many years , swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
now i found this principle really exciting .
so the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who 's best , and they learn from it .
continuous improvement .
now , that 's not the only exciting part .
that 's exciting in itself .
but if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that 's not been the purpose in the first place .
so if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u.s. and sweden .
they looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
in the united states , the number was three times higher than in sweden .
so many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
we did a study where we looked at oecd data .
oecd does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
the united states has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in oecd .
now , if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average oecd , it would save the american people 500 billion u.s. dollars a year .
that 's 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it 's all logical , but is it possible ?
this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and i would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
in my practice as a consultant , i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
they were always best in class .
we were always best in class .
and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
but most of them do n't know .
but physicians have another characteristic .
they actually thrive from peer recognition .
if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
they will share the information on how to improve .
so it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this is n't only an idea .
this is happening in reality .
we 're creating a global community , and a large global community , where we 'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
together with two academic institutions , michael porter at harvard business school , and the karolinska institute in sweden , bcg has formed something we call ichom .
you may think that 's a sneeze , but it 's not a sneeze , it 's an acronym .
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement .
we 're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
they 've worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
the four groups will publish their data in november of this year .
that 's the first time we 'll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
next year , we 're planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
in three years ' time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
compare apples to apples . who 's better ?
why is that ?
five months ago , i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe .
they have a new ceo , and she has a vision : i want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
this particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
the group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
can we measure it better than we do ?
we discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
and we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
there was an enormous energy in the room .
there were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
at the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
`` he looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , i forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , `` '' thank you . ''
`` thank you . today , we 're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . '' '' by measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution . ''
i believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and i 'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the greek hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
thank you .

i 'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most , what factors actually matter the most for startup success .
i believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
you get them to achieve unbelievable things .
so i looked at these five .
i used to think that the idea was everything .
but then over time , i came to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability , that mattered even more than the idea .
`` i never thought i 'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage , but he once said , `` '' everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . '' '' ( laughter ) and i think that 's so true about business as well . ''
does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding .
so i tried to rank across all of those attributes how i felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
and then for non-idealab companies , i looked at wild successes , like airbnb and instagram and uber and youtube and linkedin .
timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
i 'd done well at school . expectations for me were high , and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
underneath , i was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me .
`` i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i 'd done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , `` she is leaving the room . '' ''
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
`` `` she is opening the door . '' ''
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
and the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything i did in the third person .
`` `` she is going to a lecture . '' ''
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people do n't hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
i spent some time telling the college g.p .
and to be fair , i was desperate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange commentator .
`` for example , i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , i said , `` '' i 'm sorry , doctor , i 've got to go . ''
it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
a hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
you see that glass of water ?
in effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which i felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
by now , i had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
a broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who 've helped me .
i believe that eleanor can get through this .
`` sometimes , you know , it snows as late as may , but summer always comes eventually . '' '' fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place . ''
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i 'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
so for example , voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
now at first , i would have believed them .
i remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents ' room to protect them from what i thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
`` it was like , `` '' do n't mess with me . ''
`` i 've got a plastic fork , do n't you know ? '' '' strategic . ''
it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
i 'm now very proud to be a part of intervoice , the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr. sandra escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
this type of society is not only possible , it 's already on its way .
to paraphrase chavez , once social change begins , it can not be reversed .
you can not humiliate the person who feels pride .
you can not oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
in the last 20 years , the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
as peter levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone 's suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
the light never goes out .
`` as a very wonderful doctor once said to me , `` '' do n't tell me what other people have told you about yourself . ''
`` tell me about you . '' '' thank you . ''

i 'm here to share my photography .
or is it photography ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you ca n't take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
when i say realism , i mean photo-realism .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it 's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
but what 's the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
it 's not really what is realistic , it 's what we think looks realistic really .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it ca n't .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply does n't accept the fact that it does n't really make sense .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
it 's just really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it 's the things that we do n't even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these images are n't really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
so here 's another example .
( laughter ) one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's manipulated .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you do n't need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
the shores are from a different location .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
then it 's about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .

[ on april 3 , 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history . ] [ the panama papers exposed rich and powerful people ] [ hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts . ] [ what does this mean ? ] [ we called robert palmer of global witness to explain . ] this week , there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a panamanian-based law firm called mossack fonseca .
the release of these papers from panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
the prime minister of iceland has resigned .
we 've also had news that an ally of the brutal syrian dictator bashar al-assad has also got offshore companies .
there 's been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to president vladimir putin of russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
and there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a john grisham novel .
it seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we care about this ?
but the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
now , for my organization global witness , this exposé has been phenomenal .
we have the world 's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
now , i think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
i like to think of it a bit like a russian doll .
so you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what 's going on .
i also think it 's interesting that there 's been less coverage of this issue in the united states .
and that 's perhaps because some prominent us people just have n't figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
now , that 's not because there are no rich americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
it 's just because of the way in which offshore works , mossack fonseca has fewer american clients .
i think if we saw leaks from the cayman islands or even from delaware or wyoming or nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to americans .
in fact , in a number of us states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
that sort of secrecy in america has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren .
it has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
this is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
now , at global witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
how does this actually work ?
so what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 manhattan law firms .
our investigator posed as an african minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the united states to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .
it 's also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
this is not just about an individual lawyer who 's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
it 's not just about a particular senior politician who 's been caught up in a scandal .
and in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
but as a natural optimist , i do see that we are starting to get some change .
over the last couple of years , we 've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
this issue was put on the political agenda by the uk prime minister david cameron at a big g8 summit that was held in northern ireland in 2013 .
one of the things that is sad is that , actually , the us is lagging behind .
so we 'd really want to see the panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the us and around the world .
for us at global witness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
`` we need business leaders to stand up and say , `` secrecy like this is not good for business . '' ''
we need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
chris anderson : julian , welcome .
it 's been reported that wikileaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined .
can that possibly be true ?
julian assange : yeah , can it possibly be true ?
it 's a worry — is n't it ? — that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
ca : how does it work ?
how do people release the documents ?
and how do you secure their privacy ?
ja : so these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
so we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to enact those legal protections .
we get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do , when you 're talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
ca : so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
ja : that 's right , yeah . very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( phone ring ) god damn it .
( laughter ) ca : i think that 's the cia asking what the code is for a ted membership . ( laughter )
so let 's take [ an ] example , actually .
this is something you leaked a few years ago .
if we can have this document up ...
so this was a story in kenya a few years ago .
can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
ja : so this is the kroll report .
this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
prior to 2004 , kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about 18 years .
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
and when kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in kenya .
it 's the holy grail of kenyan journalism .
so i went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , december 28 .
when we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , daniel arap moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around president kibaki 's neck .
ca : and — i mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
ja : yeah . so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya , in tanzanian and south african press .
and so it came in from the outside .
and that , after a couple of days , made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on kenyan tv , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
ca : wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
ja : yep .
( applause ) ca : here 's — we 're going to just show a short clip from this baghdad airstrike video .
the video itself is longer , but here 's a short clip .
this is — this is intense material , i should warn you .
radio : ... just fuckin ' , once you get on 'em just open 'em up .
i see your element , uh , got about four humvees , uh , out along ...
you 're clear . all right . firing .
let me know when you 've got them . let 's shoot .
light 'em all up .
c'mon , fire !
( machine gun fire ) keep shoot 'n . keep shoot 'n . ( machine gun fire ) keep shoot 'n .
hotel ... bushmaster two-six , bushmaster two-six ,
we need to move , time now !
all right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
yeah , we see two birds [ helicopters ] , and we 're still firing .
roger . i got 'em .
two-six , this is two-six , we 're mobile .
oops , i 'm sorry . what was going on ?
god damn it , kyle . all right , hahaha . i hit 'em .
ca : so , what was the impact of that ?
ja : the impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story .
so this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
ca : so , i mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two reuters employees ?
ja : yeah . two reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
there were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
ca : and releasing this caused widespread outrage .
what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
ja : i do n't know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
and there was two journalists involved that clearly were n't insurgents because that 's their full-time job .
ca : i mean , there 's been this u.s. intelligence analyst , bradley manning , arrested , and it 's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified u.s. embassy cables .
i mean , did he ?
ja : we have denied receiving those cables .
he has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the reykjavik u.s. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
i mean , i was a known visitor of that embassy .
ca : i mean , if you did receive thousands of u.s. embassy diplomatic cables ...
ja : we would have released them . ( ca : you would ? ) ja : yeah . ( ca : because ? ) ja : well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
if you look at declassified cables , that 's the sort of material that 's there .
ca : so let 's talk a little more broadly about this .
i mean , in general , what 's your philosophy ?
why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
ja : well , there 's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
and there 's a lot of information .
so information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that 's a really good signal that when the information gets out , there 's a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
and that 's what we 've found in practice , and that 's what the history of journalism is .
ca : but are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
ja : not that we have seen with anything we have released .
i mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
but there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that 's a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
ca : so they are well-motivated .
`` and what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u.s. military , and he says , `` '' you know what , you 've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out . ''
it shows a u.s. soldier laughing at people dying .
that gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that u.s. soldiers are inhuman people .
`` actually , they 're not . my son is n't . how dare you ? '' '' what would you say to that ? ''
ja : yeah , we do get a lot of that .
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan — they do n't need to see the video ; they see it every day .
so it 's not going to change their opinion . it 's not going to change their perception .
that 's what they see every day .
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that 's our hope .
ca : so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
light is good .
but do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
ja : not really . i mean , we do n't have any wikileaks dissidents yet .
we do n't have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
ca : i 'd actually be interested , just based on what we 've heard so far — i 'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience .
you know , there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian .
you know , hero — people 's hero — bringing this important light .
dangerous troublemaker .
who 's got the hero view ?
who 's got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
ja : oh , come on . there must be some .
ca : it 's a soft crowd , julian , a soft crowd .
we have to try better . let 's show them another example .
now here 's something that you have n't yet leaked , but i think for ted you are .
i mean it 's an intriguing story that 's just happened , right ?
what is this ?
ja : so this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
so late last year — in november last year — there was a series of well blowouts in albania , like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico , but not quite as big .
and we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
and part of the albanian government was in this , etc. , etc .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
we could n't verify it because we did n't know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
`` so under that basis , we put it out and said , `` '' look , we 're skeptical about this thing . ''
we do n't know , but what can we do ?
`` the material looks good , it feels right , but we just ca n't verify it . '' '' and we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( laughter ) saying , `` '' hey , we want to track down the source . '' '' and we were like , `` '' oh , tell us more . ''
what document is it , precisely , you 're talking about ?
can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
`` is it really yours ? '' '' so they sent us this screen shot with the author in the microsoft word id . ''
yeah .
( applause ) that 's happened quite a lot though .
this is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
ca : yeah . have you had information from inside bp ?
ja : yeah , we have a lot , but i mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
so our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we 're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
that 's a problem .
i mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we 're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but do n't have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
ca : so that 's the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and/or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
ja : yep . yeah , and trusted people .
i mean , we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
ca : so help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
and i think i read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
can that be right ?
ja : well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
( laughter ) ca : i mean , a psychologist might say that 's a recipe for breeding paranoia .
ja : what , the movie business ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) ca : and you were also — i mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
ja : well , i was a journalist .
you know , i was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
i wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
i mean there 's like — there 's a method that can be deployed for various things .
unfortunately , at the moment , it 's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother 's bank accounts .
so this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
ca : yeah , well , i certainly do n't think you 're stealing anyone 's grandmother 's bank account , but what about your core values ?
can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
ja : i 'm not sure about the incident .
but the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
and that 's something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
ca : capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
ja : yeah . and you know , i 'm a combative person , so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
and so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
ca : so just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in iceland ?
you basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
instead , they publicized your side .
that made you very high-profile in iceland . what happened next ?
ja : yeah , this is a great case , you know .
iceland went through this financial crisis .
it was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
its banking sector was 10 times the gdp of the rest of the economy .
anyway , so we release this report in july last year .
`` and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , `` this has never happened before . what do we do ? '' ''
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in iceland , went to iceland and spoke about this issue .
and there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new nobel prize for freedom of speech .
iceland 's a nordic country , so , like norway , it 's able to tap into the system .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously .
ca : wow .
( applause ) last question , julian .
when you think of the future then , do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it 's just all to be played for either way ?
ja : i 'm not sure which way it 's going to go .
i mean , there 's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the e.u. , between china and the united states .
which way is it going to go ? it 's hard to see .
that 's why it 's a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
ca : well , it looks like i 'm reflecting the audience 's opinion to say , julian , be careful , and all power to you .
ja : thank you , chris . ( ca : thank you . ) ( applause )
i feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that 's generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
in 1975 , when i was seven years old , women in iceland went on a strike .
they did no work that day , whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home .
they marched into the center of reykjavík — 90 percent of women participated — and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality .
nothing worked in iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
( applause ) five years later , icelanders had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman as their president .
i will never forget this day , that president vigdís , as we know her by her first name , stepped out on the balcony of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won .
( applause ) this woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys .
`` who am i to be president ? '' '' it turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men . ''
so a study done in the us in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women .
that 's gap of 16 percentage points , and it 's the same gap that existed a decade earlier .
and it really is a shame , because i am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more principle-based leadership in general .
so my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that i felt that i had to do my bit , even if i had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids , and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be .
and it was the journey of my life .
it was amazing .
the journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
it boiled down to nine candidates qualifying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me .
( applause ) but that 's not all the drama yet .
you may think you have drama in the us , but i can — ( laughter ) i can assure you we had our own drama in iceland .
so our sitting president of 20 years announced initially that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running .
then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous panama papers that implicated him and his family .
and there was a popular protest in iceland , so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader .
a few days later , relations to his wife and her family 's companies were also discovered in the panama papers , and so he withdrew from the race again .
before doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office .
so on may 9 , 45 days before election day , it was not looking too good for me .
i did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
the polls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned .
i found out on the afternoon of the first tv debate that i would participate along with the three men , and i found out on live tv that i came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first tv debate .
( applause ) so , challenges .
the foremost challenges i had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
let 's start with media .
i ca n't say that i agree .
it proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
as a matter of fact , the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media 87 times in the months leading up to the elections , whereas i appeared 31 times .
and i am not saying media is doing this consciously .
i think largely this has to do with unconscious bias , because in media , much like everywhere else , we have both conscious and unconscious bias , and we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it .
`` when i finally got access to tv , the first question i got was , `` '' are you going to quit ? '' '' and that was a hard one . ''
but of course , with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls , maybe it 's understandable .
but media really matters , and every time i appeared on tv , we saw and experienced a rise in the polls , so i know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it .
i was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage about the elections .
so i did face this , but i will say this to compliment the icelandic media .
i got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit .
( applause ) so kudos to them .
but there is another experience that 's very important .
i ran as an independent candidate , not with any political party or muscle behind me .
that lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign , but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently .
we ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that .
it may be the reason why i had less airtime on tv , because i wanted to show other contenders respect .
when access to media proved to be so difficult , we ran our own media .
i ran live facebook sessions where i took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot .
and we put all the questions i got and all the answers on an open facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establish trust .
and when reaching young voters proved to be challenging , i became a snapchatter .
i got young people to teach me how to do that , and i used every filter on snapchat during the last part of the campaign .
and i actually had to use a lot of humor and humility , as i was very bad at it .
but we grew the following amongst young people by doing that .
so it 's possible to run a different type of campaign .
but unfortunately , one can not talk about politics without mentioning money .
i am sad that it is that way , but it 's true , and we had less financial resources than the other candidates .
this probably was partly due to the fact that i think i had a harder time asking for financial support .
and maybe i also had the ambition to do more with less .
some would call that very womanly of me .
but even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came in .
i surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
( laughter ) so the first numbers , i came in neck to neck to the leading candidate .
( cheers ) well , too early , because i did n't quite pull that , but i came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with nearly a third of the vote , and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin , or 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at .
some people call me the real winner of the election because of this , and there are many people who encouraged me to run again .
but what really makes me proud is to know that i earned proportionately higher percentage support from the young people , and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040 .
( applause ) she is 13 , and she had never been on tv before .
and on election day , i observed her on tv repeatedly , and she was smart , she was self-confident , she was sincere , and she was supportive of her mother .
this was probably the highlight of my campaign .
( applause ) but there was another one .
audience : aw !
this picture was really enough of a win for me .
what we see , we can be .
so screw fear and challenges .
( applause ) it matters that women run , and it 's time for women to run for office , be it the office of the ceo or the office of the president .
`` i also managed to put an impression on your very own `` '' new yorker . '' '' i earned a new title , `` '' a living emoji of sincerity . '' '' ( cheers ) it is possibly my proudest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what i call their emotional capital , but i know from experience that we become so good when we do just that . ''
( applause ) and we need more of that .
we celebrated as if we had won on election night , because that 's how we felt .
so you do n't necessarily have to reach that office .
you just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before .
so we had a good time , and i learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than i can share here in the time we have today .
but rest assured , it was hard work .
i lost a lot of sleep during those months .
it took resilience and perseverance to not quit , but i learned something that i knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that .
as a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may cheat on your intuition , but your intuition never cheats on you .
i think it 's also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it 's the team you take along .
it 's having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
that 's the formula for success for me , and i am blessed with an amazing husband , here today , an incredible family — ( applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena , and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible .
as a matter of fact , the leading pr expert told me before i made my decision that i would do well to get seven percent .
i appreciated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was basing it on valuable experience .
but on the one percent day , i decided here to show him that he was wrong .
it 's very important to mention this , because i did lose a lot of sleep , and i worked hard , and so did the people with me .
we can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
and it 's two things that i think are very important in that , in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you , but it 's equally important , maybe even more important , to have the courage to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy , including the wonderful bloggers and commentators .
i took a lot of support from others in doing this , and i made the decision to go high when others went low , and that 's partly how i kept my energy going throughout all of this .
and when i lost my energy for a moment — and i did from time to time , it was n't easy — i went back to why i decided to run , and how i had decided to run my own race .
i called it a 4g campaign , the g 's representing the icelandic words .
`` and the first one is called `` '' gagn . '' '' i ran to do good , to be of service , and i wanted servant leadership to be at the center of how i worked and everybody else in the campaign . ''
`` second one is `` '' gleði , '' '' or joy . ''
i decided to enjoy the journey .
and i tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well .
`` third is `` '' gagnsæi . '' '' i was open to any questions . ''
i kept no secrets , and it was all open , on facebook and websites .
because i think if you 're choosing your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
last but not least , i do n't need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of girlpower .
( cheers ) i am incredibly glad that i had the courage to run , to risk failure but receive success on so many levels .
i ca n't tell you that it was easy , but i can tell you , and i think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause )
pat mitchell : i 'm not letting you go yet . halla tómasdóttir : what a great crowd . pm : i ca n't let you go without saying
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to iceland and vote for you .
i mean , i 'm old enough to remember 1975 when all the icelandic women walked out , and that really was a very big factor in launching the women 's movement .
you made a reference to it earlier . i 'd love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill .
and then what you may not know because our american media did not report it , the icelandic women walked out again on monday . right ?
ht : yes , they did . pm : can you tell us about that ?
ht : yes , so 41 years after the original strike , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work is n't done .
so at 2:38pm on monday , women in iceland left work , because that 's when they had earned their day 's salary .
( applause ) what 's really cool about this is that young women and men participated in greater numbers than before , because it is time that we close the pay gap .
pm : so i 'm not going to ask halla to commit right now to what she 's doing next , but i will say that you 'd have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again .
thank you halla .
ht : thank you all .
( applause )
as a matter of fact , i was trying to think about my career since i left the white house , and the best example i have is a cartoon in the new yorker a couple of years ago .
`` this little boy is looking up at his father , and he says , `` '' daddy , when i grow up , i want to be a former president . '' '' ( laughter ) well , i have had a great blessing as a former president , because i have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe . ''
not only am i familiar with the 50 states in the united states , but also my wife and i have visited more than 145 countries in the world , and the carter center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on earth .
and a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of africa .
so our overall commitment at the carter center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as i do , i can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
( applause ) there are a couple of reasons for this that i 'll mention to begin with .
first of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures , holy scriptures , in the bible , old testament , new testament , quran and so forth , and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques .
and they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of god .
this is a very serious problem . it 's ordinarily not addressed .
a number of years ago , in the year 2000 , i had been a baptist , a southern baptist for 70 years — i tell you , i still teach sunday school every sunday ; i 'll be teaching this sunday as well — but the southern baptist convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position , a subservient position to men .
so they issued an edict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pastors , deacons in the church , or chaplains in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a southern baptist seminary , they can not teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the bible , there 's over 30,000 verses in the bible , that say that a woman should n't teach a man , and so forth .
but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
that is an all-pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of god , why should i treat them as equals myself ?
why should i pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work ?
the other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
in the united states of america , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison .
when i was in office as governor of georgia , one out of every 1,000 americans were in prison .
nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
that 's a sevenfold increase .
and since i left the white house , there 's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison .
we also have [ one of the only countries ] on earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
and we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
we 're in california now , and i figured out the other day that california has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty .
if you add that up , that 's 307 million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed .
nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty , because it costs so much . ( applause ) so the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women .
let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and i 'll be fairly brief , because i have a limited amount of time , as you know .
genital mutilation is horrible and not known by american women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that 's a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman 's genitalia .
and sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
and then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex .
this is not a rare thing , although it 's against the law in most countries .
in egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
in some countries , it 's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity .
this is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries .
another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with misinterpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there 's nothing in the quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing .
and this is done by members of her own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family .
an analysis was done in egypt not so long ago by the united nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father , the uncle or the brother , but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women .
another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery , or human trafficking it 's called nowadays .
there were about 12.5 million people sold from africa into slavery in the new world back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
there are 30 million people now living in slavery .
the united states department of state now has a mandate from congress to give a report every year , and the state department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery .
in the united states right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery .
atlanta , georgia , where the carter center is located and where i teach at emory university , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
it 's the number one place in the nation because of that .
atlanta has the busiest airport in the world , and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the southern hemisphere .
if a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
a white-skinned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in atlanta and in the united states now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
the sex trade in atlanta , georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in atlanta , georgia .
so this is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there 's not a whorehouse in america that 's not known by the local officials , the local policemen , or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth .
and this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world .
sweden has got a good approach to it .
about 15 to 20 years ago , sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery , but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted , and — ( applause ) — prostitution has gone down .
in the united states , we take just the opposite position .
for every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the united states of america .
canada , ireland , i 've already said sweden , france , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called swedish model .
that 's another thing that can be done .
we have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
in the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
the last report i got , there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military — 26,000 .
only 3,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine , or a battalion in the army or a company in the marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command , sexual assaults are taking place , so they do not do it .
that law needs to be changed .
about one out of four girls who enter american universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates , and this is now getting a lot of publicity , partially because of my book , but other things , and so 89 universities in america are now condemned by the department of education under title ix because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault .
the department of justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they 'll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity .
they 're not prosecuted .
those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
another thing that 's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work , as you know . ( applause ) and this is sometimes misinterpreted , but for full-time employment , a woman in the united states now gets 23 percent less than a man .
when i became president , the difference was 39 percent .
so we 've made some progress , partially because i was president and so forth — ( applause ) ( laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there 's been no progress made , so it 's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
these are the kind of things that go on .
if you take the fortune 500 companies , 23 of them have women ceos , out of 500 , and those ceos , i need not tell you , make less on an average than the other ceos .
well , that 's what goes on in our country .
another problem with the united states is we are the most warlike nation on earth .
we have been to war with about 25 different countries since the second world war .
sometimes , we 've had soldiers on the ground fighting .
the other times , we 've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people .
other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
we 've been at war with 25 different countries or more since the second world war .
there was four years , i wo n't say which ones , where we did n't — ( applause ) — we did n't drop a bomb , we did n't launch a missile , we did n't fire a bullet .
but anyway , those kinds of things , the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes , are the basic causes , of abuse of women and girls .
there 's one more basic cause that i need not mention , and that is that in general , men do n't give a damn .
( applause ) that 's true .
the average man that might say , i 'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy , and this is very similar to what i knew when i was a child , when separate but equal had existed .
racial discrimination , legally , had existed for 100 years , from 1865 at the end of the war between the states , the civil war , all the way up to the 1960s , when lyndon johnson got the bills passed for equal rights .
but during that time , there were many white people that did n't think that racial discrimination was okay , but they stayed quiet , because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs , unique access to jury duty , better schools , and everything else , and that 's the same thing that exists today , because the average man really does n't care .
`` even though they say , `` '' i 'm against discrimination against girls and women , '' '' they enjoy a privileged position . ''
and it 's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system , the majority of men that control the military system , the majority of men that control the governments of the world , and the majority of men that control the great religions .
so what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
i would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one , and where you come from , europe and so forth , who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act , need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world .
the average woman in egypt does n't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth .
i did n't even go down to detail about that .
but i hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters .
i have 12 grandchildren , four children , and 10 great-grandchildren , and i think often about them and about the plight that they will face in america , not only if they lived in egypt or a foreign country , in having equal rights , and i hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights .
thank you very much .

`` `` what i will '' i will not dance to your war drum . ''

( applause ) a bunch of pacifists .
confused , aspiring pacifists .
i understand .
i 've been wrong a lot lately .
like a lot .
so i could n't figure out what to read today .
i mean , i 've been saying i 've been prepping .
what that means is prepping my outfit , ( laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what i 'm coming behind and going in front of .
poetry does that .
it preps you . it aims you .
so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
but i 'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
hold her now with you .
you do n't need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
are you holding her ?
`` this is `` '' break clustered . '' '' all holy history banned . ''
unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
but my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man 's creative violence .
whose son shall it be ?
which male child will perish a new day ?
our boys ' deaths galvanize .
we cherish corpses .
we mourn women , complicated .
bitches get beat daily .
profits made , prophets ignored .
war and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
all colors run , none of us solid .
do n't look for shadow behind me . i carry it within .
i live cycles of light and darkness .

i see now , i never was one and not the other .
sickness , health , tender violence .
i think now i never was pure .
before form i was storm , blind , ign'ant — still am .
human contracted itself blind , malignant .
i never was pure .
girl spoiled before ripened .
language ca n't math me .
i experience exponentially .
everything is everything .
one woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
one woman loses six .
one woman loses her head .
one woman searches rubble . one woman feeds on trash .
one woman shoots her face . one woman shoots her husband .
one woman straps herself .
one woman gives birth to a baby .
one woman gives birth to borders .
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
one woman never did .
where do refugee hearts go ?
broken , dissed , placed where they 're not from , do n't want to be missed .

when i was a student here in oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
the population explosion was unstoppable .
global famine was inevitable .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
none of those things happened , ( laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
child mortality is down by two-thirds .
per-capita food production is up by a third .
and all this at a time when the population has doubled .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it 's a good thing or not ?
how did we achieve that ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita .
i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
in other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
i want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
these are both real objects .
one is an acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo erectus .
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
they 're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
i 've tried to work out which is bigger , and it 's almost impossible .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
they 're both technologies . in the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
the differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
there was no progress , no innovation .
it 's an extraordinary phenomenon , but it 's true .
whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
and there 's another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
and more than that , it 's a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
they 've all been combined together in this technology .
and it 's this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it 's the secret to understanding what 's happening in the world .
my body 's an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
they 've come together .
how does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
in an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
one goes extinct for the other to survive .
but if you have a sexual species , then it 's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
it 's not confined to its own lineage .
what 's the process that 's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
and i think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
it 's a unique human feature .
no other animal does it .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there 's reciprocity in other animals — but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
`` as adam smith said , `` '' no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . '' '' ( laughter ) you can have culture without exchange . ''
you can have , as it were , asexual culture .
chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
in this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
there 's no exchange of ideas between them .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
well , the answer came from david ricardo in 1817 .
and here is a stone age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .
he does n't need adam .
he can make his own spears and axes .
well no , because if you think about it , if oz makes two spears and adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
and the more they do this , the more true it 's going to be , because the more they do this , the better adam is going to get at making axes and the better oz is going to get at making spears .
so the gains from trade are only going to grow .
and this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
adam and oz both saved an hour of time .
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
if you had to start from scratch , let 's say you go out into the countryside .
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it .
you render it down . you make a candle , etc . etc .
how long is it going to take you ? quite a long time .
how long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you 're on the average wage in britain today ?
and the answer is about half a second .
back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
and that 's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you 've gained since 1950 , as it were , because that 's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
and back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
back in 1800 , you 'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
`` go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : `` '' who made them and for who ? '' '' the stone axe was made by someone for himself . ''
it was self-sufficiency .
we call that poverty these days .
but the object on the right was made for me by other people .
how many other people ?
tens ? hundreds ? thousands ?
you know , i think it 's probably millions .
because you 've got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
they were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
and that 's the way society works .
that 's what we 've achieved as a species .
in the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
that 's how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
louis xiv had a lot of people working for him .
they made his silly outfits , like this , ( laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
he had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
they 're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they 're all ready to serve you at an hour 's notice with an excellent meal that 's probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
and that 's what we 've done , because we 're all working for each other .
we 're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards .
now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
but there 's a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
there 's no working for each other across the colonies .
and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor .
that is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
the queen does it all .
in our species , we do n't like doing that .
it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
( laughter ) even in england , we do n't leave reproduction to the queen .
( applause ) so when did this habit start ?
and how long has it been going on ? and what does it mean ?
well , i think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
but i 've got no evidence for that .
it just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
in all hunter-gatherer societies today , there 's a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
it is n't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
the woman knows that , in the hadzas ' case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
and she does n't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
and the man knows that he does n't have to do any digging to get roots .
all he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it 's big enough to share some .
and so both sides raise each other 's standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
when did this happen ? we do n't know , but it 's possible that neanderthals did n't do this .
they were a highly cooperative species .
they were a highly intelligent species .
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
they were imaginative . they buried their dead .
they had language , probably , because we know they had the foxp2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in oxford .
and so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
they were brilliant people . i 'm not dissing the neanderthals .
but there 's no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
there 's no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
and the other thing there 's no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
for example , in the caucasus there 's a site where you find local neanderthal tools .
they 're always made from local chert .
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
trade is 10 times as old as farming .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
and the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in ethiopia .
you also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the mediterranean in algeria .
and that 's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
and that will have led to specialization .
how do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa , which was a quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe .
they traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of australia .
so long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
and the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
an example is tasmania .
when the sea level rose and tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
it 's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
how many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
it did n't happen in tierra del fuego — similar island , similar people .
the reason : because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
the tasmanians were isolated .
go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
in the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
nobody , literally nobody .
there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
i mean this quite seriously .
the president of the computer mouse company does n't know .
he just knows how to run a company .
the person on the assembly line does n't know because he does n't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
we all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
`` i am of course quoting from a famous essay by leonard read , the economist in the 1950s , called `` '' i , pencil '' '' in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it do n't know how to mine graphite , and they do n't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing . ''
and what we 've done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we 've created the ability to do things that we do n't even understand .
it 's not the same with language .
with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
but with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
we 've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
and by the way , that 's one of the reasons that i 'm not interested in the debate about i.q. , about whether some groups have higher i.q.s than other groups .
it 's completely irrelevant .
what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they 're cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
so we 've created something called the collective brain .
we 're just the nodes in the network .
we 're the neurons in this brain .
it 's the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
however , bad things happen .
and in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
there will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
awful things will happen in this century , i 'm absolutely sure .
but i 'm also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i 'm also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we 've created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
thank you .

good afternoon .
my name is uldus .
i am a photo-based artist from russia .
i focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
today , i 'm going to tell you about my project , which is named desperate romantics .
they 're my artifacts , or paintings from pre-raphaelites brotherhood england mid-19th century .
i took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in russia , capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story .
this boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
but this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different is n't easy , especially in russia .
next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
and this is nikita , a security guard from one of the bars in st. petersburg .
`` he likes to say , `` '' you would n't like me when i 'm angry , '' '' quoting hulk from the movie , but i 've never seen him angry . ''
he hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in russia , among guys , that 's not cool to be romantic , but it 's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
( laughter ) sometimes , in my project , i would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
sometimes , i would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , iron man , ironing man .
interesting fact about marriage in russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
we 're taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
and what about me ?
i 'm 27 years old .
for russian society , i 'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
that 's why you see me in a mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
but remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
be brave . be ironic — it helps .
be funny and create some magic .
( applause )
my name is amit .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who 's actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i 'm going to focus on the demo .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it 's access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education — i 'm not complaining — but i did n't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
and so when i started traveling and going to these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i 'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we 've had since launch .
so , simple : you come to googleartproject.com .
you look around at all these museums here .
you 've got the uffizi , you 've got the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
i 'm going to actually get to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in — very simple .
click and , bang , you 're in this museum .
it does n't matter where you are — bombay , mexico , it does n't really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you 're in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
( applause ) thanks . i have n't come to the best part .
`` ( laughter ) so now i 'm in front of one of my favorite paintings , `` '' the harvesters '' '' by pieter bruegel at the met . ''
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but i 'm going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
`` and i get a lot of people asking me : `` what do you get for 10 billion pixels ? '' ''
so i 'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
`` and i was like , `` '' hold on . that sounds interesting . '' '' went in , and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something . ''
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday .
and apparently it was quite popular .
i do n't know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
now just to give you some perspective , i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
( applause ) the best is yet to come — so in a second .
so now let 's just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
`` so another one of my favorites , `` '' the starry night . '' '' now the example i showed you was all about finding details . ''
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
i 'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i 'm really going to get to the cracks .
`` this is `` '' the starry night , '' '' i think , never seen like this before . ''
i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature .
there 's a lot of other stuff here , but i do n't have time .
this is the real cool part . it 's called collections .
any one of you , anybody — does n't matter if you 're rich , if you 're poor , if you have a fancy house — does n't matter .
you can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in — and i 've created this , called the power of zoom — you can just zoom around .
`` this is `` '' the ambassadors , '' '' based in the national gallery . ''
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you 're feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it does n't , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
i probably should n't say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that 's been my humbling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
`` and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is , `` '' did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? '' '' and the answer is no . ''
it 's to supplement the experience .
and that 's it . thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
i 'm a storyteller .
that 's what i do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
i will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
i was born in strasbourg , france to turkish parents .
shortly after , my parents got separated , and i came to turkey with my mom .
from then on , i was raised as a single child by a single mother .
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual .
our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
in fact , i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
on the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman .
on the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
each time , my grandmother would utter some words in arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
a week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
now , i 'm aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
i asked her how she did this . was it the power of praying ?
`` in response she said , `` '' yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . '' '' from her , i learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls . ''
it will dry up inside .
now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
we all do .
we 're born into a certain family , nation , class .
but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
ironically , [ living in ] communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today 's globalized world .
and it 's happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , east and west alike .
we tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
in my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
stories can not demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
and through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
i started writing fiction at the age of eight .
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i 'd be interested in keeping a personal journal .
in retrospect , i think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
i was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except i told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
i was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
what she did n't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself .
instead , i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
and thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
so from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
and please bear with me : i 'll draw a circle and come back to this point .
now one other thing happened around this same time .
my mother became a diplomat .
so from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , i was zoomed into this posh , international school [ in madrid ] , where i was the only turk .
`` it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the `` '' representative foreigner . '' '' in our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy . ''
instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
we were like a miniature united nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
and i should know , because during the time i attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope , and turkey got zero points in [ the ] eurovision song contest .
( laughter ) i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
`` the other children asked me about the movie `` '' midnight express , '' '' which i had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day i smoked , because they thought all turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair . ''
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
after spain , we went to jordan , germany and ankara again .
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me .
stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big cs that i otherwise lacked .
in my mid-twenties , i moved to istanbul , the city i adore .
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .
i was in istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
when i ran out of the building at three in the morning , i saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
there was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who did n't sell alcohol and did n't speak to marginals .
he was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
in the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
but i 've always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
i 'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
shortly after , i went to a women 's college in boston , then michigan .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
i started writing fiction in english .
i 'm not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why i do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
i love writing in turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
so i feel connected to each language in a different way .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
when you 're a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
as latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there 's a gap between the mind and the tongue .
and that gap is very intimidating .
but if we manage not to be frightened by it , it 's also stimulating .
and this is what i discovered in boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
at this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all .
and because god loves her , i did get married .
( laughter ) but instead of settling down , i went to arizona .
and since my husband is in istanbul , i started commuting between arizona and istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that could n't be more different .
i guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i 've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
and this is a subject that i would love to think about together .
when my first novel written in english came out in america , i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
`` `` i liked your book , '' he said , `` but i wish you had written it differently . '' ''
( laughter ) i asked him what he meant by that .
`` he said , `` '' well , look at it . there 's so many spanish , american , hispanic characters in it , but there 's only one turkish character and it 's a man . '' '' now the novel took place on a university campus in boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters , but i understood what my critic was looking for . ''
and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him .
he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one .
we often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
many authors feel this pressure , but non-western authors feel it more heavily .
if you 're a woman writer from the muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women .
you 're expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your western colleagues .
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today .
writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from china , a few from turkey , a few from nigeria .
we 're all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
the writer and commuter james baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
`` when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , baldwin stopped and said , `` '' but do n't you see ? there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . '' '' when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger . ''
there 's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together .
i never forget my first multicultural reading , in harvard square about 10 years ago .
we were three writers , one from the philippines , one turkish and one indonesian — like a joke , you know .
( laughter ) and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
it was only because of our passports .
multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
a function is attributed to fiction .
in this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
but i must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the west .
it comes from everywhere .
and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
i had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women .
my micro story became a macro issue when i was prosecuted .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
it was just a story .
`` and when i say , `` '' just a story , '' '' i 'm not trying to belittle my work . ''
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
`` chekhov said , `` '' the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things . ''
`` and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility . '' '' identity politics divides us . fiction connects . ''
one is interested in sweeping generalizations .
the other , in nuances .
one draws boundaries .
the other recognizes no frontiers .
identity politics is made of solid bricks .
fiction is flowing water .
`` in the ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called `` '' meddah . '' '' they would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising . ''
with each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , muslims and non-muslims .
`` stories cut across all boundaries , like `` '' the tales of nasreddin hodja , '' '' which were very popular throughout the middle east , north africa , the balkans and asia . ''
today , stories continue to transcend borders .
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk , they usually do n't listen to each other , but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
literature has to take us beyond .
if it can not take us there , it is not good literature .
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was — that i once was .
but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
when the poet and mystic , rumi , met his spiritual companion , shams of tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
`` the sufis say , `` '' knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . '' '' the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected . ''
there 's a metaphor which i love : living like a drawing compass .
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
like that , my fiction as well .
one part of it is rooted in istanbul , with strong turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
in that sense , i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
now those of you who have been to istanbul have probably seen topkapi palace , which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
in the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there 's an area called the gathering place of the djinn .
it 's between buildings .
i 'm intrigued by this concept .
we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
when i write fiction i cherish elusiveness and changeability .
i like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
i like it when my characters surprise me .
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a handsome , gay professor in norway .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
`` audre lorde once said , `` '' the white fathers taught us to say , 'i think , therefore i am . ' '' '' she suggested , `` '' i feel , therefore i am free . '' '' i think it was a wonderful paradigm shift . ''
`` and yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is `` '' write what you know '' '' ? ''
perhaps that 's not the right way to start at all .
imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
in the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
`` and i would like to finish with an old sufi poem : `` '' come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . '' '' thank you . ''

i 'm jane mcgonigal . i 'm a game designer .
we do achieve more in game worlds .
so , so far , collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth .
now , that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
we 're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
five million people use it every month .
that 's the problem that i 'm trying to solve .
his work is brilliant .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
we have to start making the real world work more like a game .
before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep 's knuckles .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
this is really exciting .
according to herodotus , after 18 years the famine was n't getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
we 've got a graphic novel , we 've got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
`` the `` '' dirty jobs '' '' crew and i were called to a little town in colorado , called craig . ''
it 's only a couple dozen square miles . it 's in the rockies .
and the job in question was sheep rancher .
my role on the show , for those of you who have n't seen it — it 's pretty simple .
i 'm an apprentice , and i work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
and my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it 's like to be these people , for one day in their life .
the job in question : herding sheep . great .
we go to craig and we check in to a hotel and i realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
so , normally , i never do any research at all .
but , this is a touchy subject , and i work for the discovery channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
`` so i called the humane society and i say , `` '' look , i 'm going to be castrating some lambs , can you tell me the deal ? '' '' and they 're like , `` '' yeah , it 's pretty straightforward . '' '' they use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller . ''
this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
`` and i said , `` '' well , what exactly is the process ? '' '' and they said , `` '' the band is applied to the tail , tightly . ''
and then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
`` `` great — got it . '' ''
ok , i call the spca to confirm this — they confirm it .
i also call peta , just for fun , and they do n't like it — but they confirm it .
ok , that 's basically how you do it .
so the next day i go out .
and i 'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
melanie is the wife of albert .
albert is the shepherd in question .
melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
alright . great .
albert goes in , i follow albert , the crew is around .
i always watch the process done the first time before i try it .
being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
and i 'm like that 's not rubber at all , you know .
and he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
in the space of about two seconds , albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that i was holding .
a second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
now you think you know what 's coming , michael — you do n't , ok ?
he snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what i hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding .
can we roll the video ?
no i 'm kidding — we do n't — ( laughter ) i thought it best to talk in pictures .
`` so , i do something now i 've never ever done on a `` '' dirty jobs '' '' shoot , ever . ''
`` i say , `` '' time out . stop . '' '' you guys know the show , we use take one , we do n't do take two . ''
there 's no writing , there 's no scripting , there 's no nonsense .
we do n't fool around , we do n't rehearse — we shoot what we get !
`` i said , `` '' stop . this is nuts . '' '' i mean , you know . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' this is crazy . ''
`` we ca n't do this . '' '' and albert 's like , `` '' what ? '' '' and i 'm like , `` '' i do n't know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that 's not how we do it . '' '' and he said `` '' well , that 's how we do it . '' '' and i said , `` '' why would you do it this way ? '' '' and before i even let him explain , i said , `` '' i want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . '' '' and he says , `` '' like the humane society ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes , like the humane society . ''
let 's do something that does n't make the lamb squeal and bleed — we 're on in five continents , dude .
`` we 're on twice a day on the discovery channel — we ca n't do this . '' '' he says , `` '' ok. '' '' he goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands . ''
melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
i 'm like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
gets up , walks to the corner , it 's quivering , and it lies down and it 's in obvious distress .
`` and i 'm looking at the lamb and i say , `` '' albert , how long ? ''
`` when does he get up ? '' '' he 's like , `` '' a day . '' '' i said , `` '' a day ! how long does it take them to fall off ? '' '' `` a week . '' ''
meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he 's just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
he 's , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
and i was just so blown away at how wrong i was , in that second .
and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am , so much of the time .
( laughter ) and i was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw i had that day because now i had to do what albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing 's starting to feel like a german porno , and i 'm like ... ( laughter ) melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
albert hands me the knife .
i go in , tail comes off .
i go in , i grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
`` albert instructs , `` '' push it way up there . '' '' i do . ''
`` `` push it further . '' ''
i do .
`` the testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , `` '' bite 'em . ''
`` just bite 'em off . '' '' and i heard him , i heard all the words . ''
( laughter ) like , how did — how did i get here ?
how did — you know — i mean — how did i get here ?
( laughter ) it 's just — it 's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it 's own : and suddenly , i 'm standing there , in the rockies , and all i can think of is the aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
you know , aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
`` ( laughter ) and i 'm like , `` '' what is this jacked-up metaphor ? ''
`` i do n't like what i 'm thinking right now . '' '' and i ca n't get this thought out of my head , and i ca n't get that vision out of my sight , so i did what i had to do . ''
i went in and i took them .
i took them like this , and i yanked my face back .
and i 'm standing there with two testicles on my chin .
( laughter ) and now i ca n't get — i ca n't shake the metaphor .
`` ok , i 'm still in `` '' poetics , '' '' in aristotle , and i 'm thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that i have n't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there . ''
and they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
anagnorisis and peripeteia .
anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery .
literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
`` it 's what our network does ; it 's what `` '' dirty jobs '' '' is . ''
and i 'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
great .
the other word , peripeteia , that 's the moment in the great tragedies , you know — euripides and sophocles — the moment where oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he 's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . ok .
that 's peripety or peripeteia .
and this metaphor in my head — i got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
( laughter ) i got to tell you , it 's such a great device though .
when you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
`` i mean , bruce willis in `` '' the sixth sense , '' '' right ? ''
`` spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — `` '' oh , i 'm dead '' '' — peripetia . ''
you know ?
it 's crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
`` neo in `` '' the matrix , '' '' you know ? ''
`` `` '' oh , i 'm living in a computer program '' '' — that 's weird . ''
these discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and i 've been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , i have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that i just was n't prepared for .
and , as i stood there , looking at the happy lamb that i had just defiled — but it looked ok .
looking at that poor other little thing that i 'd done it the right way on , and i just was struck by if i 'm wrong about that and if i 'm wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon ?
because , look , i 'm not a social anthropologist but i have a friend who is .
and i talk to him .
`` ( laughter ) and he says , `` '' hey mike . ''
look , i do n't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you 've shot in every state ?
you 've worked in mining , you 've worked in fishing , you 've worked in steel , you 've worked in every major industry .
`` you 've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? '' '' i can still see hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers . ''
i mean , these are the people that i work with every single day .
`` `` '' and if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it . ''
`` because , dude , you know , four years . '' '' you know , that 's in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around . ''
and , after that shoot , dirty jobs really did n't change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
and now , when i talk about the show , i no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
i do , but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong , some of the other notions of work that i 've just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they 're not .
people with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
as a group , they 're the happiest people i know .
`` and i do n't want to start whistling `` '' look for the union label , '' '' and all that happy worker crap . ''
i 'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . i swear to god — i did it with them .
they 've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
and i see it over and over and over again .
so i started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
follow your passion — we 've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
probably the worst advice i ever got .
( laughter ) you know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
i mean , that 's all i heard growing up .
i did n't know what to do with my life , but i was told if you follow your passion , it 's going to work out .
i can give you 30 examples , right now — bob combs , the pig farmer in las vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
why ? because there 's so much protein in the stuff we do n't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but god bless him .
he 's making a great living .
`` you ask him , `` '' did you follow your passion here ? '' '' and he 'd laugh at you . ''
the guy 's worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of vegas .
he did n't follow his passion .
he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
and i hear that story over and over .
matt froind , a dairy farmer in new canaan , connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
now , he 's selling them to walmart .
follow his passion ? the guy 's — come on .
so i started to look at passion , i started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as tim talked about earlier , that 's a huge distinction .
`` i started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call `` '' successories '' '' that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now . ''
that stuff — it 's suddenly all been turned on its head .
safety — safety first ?
going back to , you know , osha and peta and the humane society : what if osha got it wrong ?
i mean — this is heresy , what i 'm about to say — but what if it 's really safety third ?
right ?
( laughter ) no , i mean really .
what i mean to say is i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i 'm working with , but the ones who really get it done , they 're not out there talking about safety first .
they know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
`` and i 'll never forget , up in the bering sea , i was on a crab boat with the `` '' deadliest catch '' '' guys — which i also work on — in the first season . ''
we 're about 100 miles off the coast of russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
most hazardous environment i 'd ever seen , and i was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
so , i 'm 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it 's doing this in the ocean .
unspeakably dangerous .
`` i scamper down , i go into the wheelhouse and i say , with some level of incredulity , `` captain , osha . '' ''
`` and he says , `` '' osha ? ocean . '' '' and he points out there . ''
( laughter ) but in that moment , what he said next ca n't be repeated in the lower 48 .
it ca n't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
`` but he looked at me , and he said , `` '' son '' '' — he 's my age , by the way , he calls me son , i love that — he says , `` '' son , i 'm a captain of a crab boat . ''
my responsibility is not to get you home alive .
`` my responsibility is to get you home rich . '' '' ( laughter ) you want to get home alive , that 's on you . ''
and for the rest of that day , safety first .
i was like — so , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else 's responsibility as though it 's our own , and vice versa .
anyhow , a whole lot of things .
i could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that i got it wrong .
but , what it all comes down to is this .
i formed a theory , and i 'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
it goes like this — we 've declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
it 's a civil war .
it 's a cold war , really .
we did n't set out to do it and we did n't twist our mustache in some machiavellian way , but we 've done it .
and we 've waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in hollywood .
the way we portray working people on tv — it 's laughable .
if there 's a plumber , he 's 300 pounds and he 's got a giant butt crack . admit it .
you see him all the time .
that 's what plumbers look like , right ?
we turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
that 's what tv does .
`` we try hard on `` '' dirty jobs '' '' not to do that , which is why i do the work and i do n't cheat . ''
but , we 've waged this war on madison avenue .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what 's really being said ?
your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you did n't have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it 's all in there , over and over , again and again .
washington ? i ca n't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because i do n't really know .
i just know that that 's a front in this war .
and right here guys , silicon valley , i mean — how many people have an iphone on them right now ?
how many people have their blackberries ?
we 're plugged in ; we 're connected .
i would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
good grief , not to this crowd .
( laughter ) but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
`` and nobody celebrates imitation the way `` '' dirty jobs '' '' guys know it has to be done . ''
your iphone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
all of that ? that 's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
so , we 've got this new toolbox , you know .
our tools today do n't look like shovels and picks .
they look like the stuff we walk around with .
and so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
and i realized , probably too late in this game — i hope not , because i do n't know if i can do 200 more of these things — but we 're going to do as many as we can .
and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
i got a lot wrong .
so , we 're thinking — by we , i mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
i 'm talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we 've kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
the infrastructure is a huge deal .
this war on work , that i suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
the infrastructure 's the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
the infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
meanwhile , we 've got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the american society of civil engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a d minus .
so , if i were running for anything , and i 'm not , i would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create are n't going to stick unless they 're jobs that people want .
and i know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but i also know that clean and dirty are n't opposites .
they 're two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who i hope is n't quivering anymore , and like my time that 's gone .
it 's been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
( applause )
my big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( laughter ) ( applause ) this is a room of type-a women . this is a room
of sleep-deprived women .
and i learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
two-and-a-half years ago , i fainted from exhaustion .
i hit my head on my desk . i broke my cheekbone , i got five stitches on my right eye .
and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
and in the course of that , i studied , i met with medical doctors , scientists , and i 'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
( applause ) and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( laughter ) ( applause ) because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
`` and i felt like saying to him — but i did n't say it — i felt like saying , `` '' you know what ? ''
`` if you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . '' '' ( laughter ) there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship . ''
`` especially here in washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , `` '' how about eight o'clock ? '' '' they 're likely to tell you , `` '' eight o'clock is too late for me , but that 's okay , i can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . '' '' and they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they 're not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions . ''
so a high i.q .
does not mean that you 're a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the titanic .
and we 've had far too many icebergs hitting our titanics .
in fact , i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters , they might still be around .
( applause ) while all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what 's going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
so i urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
thank you .
( applause )
well , as chris pointed out , i study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
and i just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
and this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which i think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we 'll understand how that happens .
ok , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
i mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
how does this happen ?
well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
one approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there 's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
what then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
what you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry 's doing to generate that particular function .
so that 's what we 're trying to do .
so let me give you a few striking examples of this .
in fact , i 'm giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome .
if you look at the first slide there , that 's the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , ok — the lobes that constitute the brain .
and if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you ca n't see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
and that 's been called the face area in the brain , because when it 's damaged , you can no longer recognize people 's faces .
`` you can still recognize them from their voice and say , `` '' oh yeah , that 's joe , '' '' but you ca n't look at their face and know who it is , right ? ''
you ca n't even recognize yourself in the mirror .
i mean , you know it 's you because you wink and it winks , and you know it 's a mirror , but you do n't really recognize yourself as yourself .
ok. now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
but there 's another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
`` this is called the capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who 's otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , `` '' this looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she 's an impostor . ''
`` she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother . '' '' now , why does this happen ? ''
why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it 's not mother .
now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but i 'll just talk about guys .
when you 're a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
this is the so-called oedipus complex of freud .
i 'm not saying i believe this , but this is the standard freudian view .
and then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
thank god , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
and then what happens is , there 's a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
`` and you say , `` '' my god , if this is my mom , how come i 'm being sexually turned on ? ''
`` she 's some other woman . she 's an impostor . '' '' it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain . ''
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
it 's very ingenious , as all freudian arguments are — ( laughter ) — but did n't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( laughter )
`` he 'll say , `` '' doctor , this is not fifi . it looks exactly like fifi , but it 's some other dog . '' '' right ? ''
now , you try using the freudian explanation there .
( laughter ) you 'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
now , what 's really going on ?
so , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
you can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
i talked about that earlier .
now , when that area 's damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
but from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you 're looking at .
is it prey ? is it predator ? is it mate ?
or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — i do n't want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? ok ?
which you can completely ignore .
so if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
your heart starts beating faster .
you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you 're going to create from muscular exertion .
and that 's fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
so i can determine , when you 're looking at something , whether you 're excited or whether you 're aroused , or not , ok ?
and i 'll get to that in a minute .
so my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it 's processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , ok ?
and then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
but maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
`` so because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , `` '' oh yeah , this looks like my mother . '' '' but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , `` '' but how come , if it 's my mother , i do n't experience a warmth ? '' '' or terror , as the case may be ? right ? ''
`` ( laughter ) and therefore , he says , `` '' how do i account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ? ''
this ca n't be my mother .
`` it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother . '' '' how do you test this ? ''
well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , i can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . of course , you do n't sweat .
if i show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
and , believe it or not , if i show you a picture of your mother — i 'm talking about normal people — you start sweating .
you do n't even have to be jewish .
( laughter ) now , what happens if you show this patient ?
you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
there 's no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he 'll laugh , he 'll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
it 's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
`` by the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , `` '' wow , mom , how are you ? where are you ? '' '' there 's no delusion through the phone . ''
`` then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , `` '' who are you ? ''
`` you look just like my mother . '' '' ok ? ''
the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that 's not been cut by the accident .
so this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
when he sees her in person , he says it 's an impostor .
ok , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
and you all know what a phantom limb is .
when an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the iraq war , it 's now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that 's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
in fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
i 've had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
`` and in fact , one student asked me the other day , `` do they get phantom pms ? '' ''
( laughter ) a subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we have n't pursued that .
ok , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
one of the things we 've found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
it 'll pat his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave goodbye .
these are very compelling , vivid sensations .
the patient 's not delusional .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it 's a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
but however , about half the patients , this does n't happen .
`` the phantom limb — they 'll say , `` '' but doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed . ''
it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful .
`` if only i could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . '' '' now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ? ''
it sounds like an oxymoron .
but when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
so the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
and this is a serious clinical problem .
patients become depressed .
some of them are driven to suicide , ok ?
so , how do you treat this syndrome ?
now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
when i looked at the case sheet , i found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
why does this happen ?
`` when the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , `` '' move , '' '' but it 's getting visual feedback saying , `` '' no . '' '' move . no . move . no . move . no . ''
and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , ok ?
the brain learns , because of this hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
and then , when you 've amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , ok ?
now , how do you help these patients ?
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it 's obeying his command , right ?
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
how do you do that ? well , virtual reality .
but that costs millions of dollars .
so , i hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but do n't tell my funding agencies .
( laughter ) ok ? what you do is you create what i call a mirror box .
you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , derek , came in .
he had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
he had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
he had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he could n't move it .
it was a paralyzed phantom arm .
so he came there , and i gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which i call a mirror box , right ?
and the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . and what does he experience ?
he looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he 's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
`` `` '' now , '' '' i said , `` '' now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . '' '' he 's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ? ''
`` that 's obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , `` '' oh my god , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . '' '' and remember , my first patient who came in — ( applause ) — thank you . ( applause ) my first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and i said , `` '' look at your reflection of your phantom . '' '' and he started giggling , he says , `` '' i can see my phantom . '' '' but he 's not stupid . he knows it 's not real . ''
he knows it 's a mirror reflection , but it 's a vivid sensory experience .
`` now , i said , `` '' move your normal hand and phantom . '' '' he said , `` '' oh , i ca n't move my phantom . you know that . it 's painful . '' '' i said , `` '' move your normal hand . '' '' and he says , `` '' oh my god , my phantom is moving again . i do n't believe this ! ''
`` and my pain is being relieved . '' '' ok ? ''
`` and then i said , `` '' close your eyes . '' '' he closes his eyes . ''
`` `` and move your normal hand . '' ''
`` `` oh , nothing . it 's clenched again . '' ''
`` `` ok , open your eyes . '' ''
`` `` oh my god , oh my god , it 's moving again ! '' ''
so , he was like a kid in a candy store .
so , i said , ok , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but i 'm not going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
( laughter ) ( applause ) it 's a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( laughter )
but then i started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
`` so , i said , `` '' look , derek '' '' — well , first of all , the guy ca n't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — i said , `` '' look , derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two . ''
`` maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . '' '' so he said ok , and he took it home . ''
`` i said , `` '' look , it 's , after all , two dollars . take it home . '' '' so , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , `` '' doctor , you 're not going to believe this . '' '' i said , `` '' what ? '' '' he said , `` '' it 's gone . '' '' i said , `` '' what 's gone ? '' '' i thought maybe the mirror box was gone . ''
`` ( laughter ) he said , `` '' no , no , no , you know this phantom i 've had for the last 10 years ? ''
`` it 's disappeared . '' '' and i said — i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i 've changed this guy 's body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ? ''
`` and i said , `` '' derek , does this bother you ? '' '' he said , `` '' no , last three days , i 've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away . ''
`` but the problem is i still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box does n't reach . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' so , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so i can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? '' '' he thought i was some kind of magician . ''
now , why does this happen ?
it 's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
it 's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
on the other hand , there 's no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
and your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
it goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
and when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you ca n't have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
so , that 's the bonus .
now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
but , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
this has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
ok , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
he was a cousin of charles darwin .
he pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it 's colored .
five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , ok ?
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
or c sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
c sharp is blue , f sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
why does this happen ?
this is called synesthesia . galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
in us , all the senses are distinct .
these people muddle up their senses .
why does this happen ?
one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
synesthesia runs in families , so galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
why would that be ?
i 'm going to answer that question .
it 's never been answered before .
ok , what is synesthesia ? what causes it ?
well , there are many theories .
one theory is they 're just crazy .
now , that 's not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
now , there may be some truth to this , because it 's much more common here in the bay area than in san diego .
( laughter ) ok. now , the third theory is that — well , let 's ask ourselves what 's really going on in synesthesia . all right ?
so , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
so we said , there 's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
so , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that 's why you get synesthesia .
now remember — why does this happen ?
why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
remember i said it runs in families ?
that gives you the clue .
and that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
so , if there 's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
and if it 's between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
if it 's between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
so far , so good .
now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
`` well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , `` '' it is the east , and juliet is the sun . '' '' well , you do n't say , juliet is the sun , does that mean she 's a glowing ball of fire ? ''
i mean , schizophrenics do that , but it 's a different story , right ?
normal people say , she 's warm like the sun , she 's radiant like the sun , she 's nurturing like the sun .
instantly , you 've found the links .
now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it 's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
and , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
ok , it 's a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
the last demonstration — can i take one minute ?
( applause ) ok. i 'm going to show you that you 're all synesthetes , but you 're in denial about it .
here 's what i call martian alphabet . just like your alphabet , a is a , b is b , c is c .
different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
here , you 've got martian alphabet .
one of them is kiki , one of them is bouba .
which one is kiki and which one is bouba ?
how many of you think that 's kiki and that 's bouba ? raise your hands .
well , it 's one or two mutants .
( laughter ) how many of you think that 's bouba , that 's kiki ? raise your hands .
ninety-nine percent of you .
now , none of you is a martian . how did you do that ?
it 's because you 're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you 're saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
now , this is very important , because what it 's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it 's just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
it 's a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that 's damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in bouba kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
`` if you ask this guy , what — `` '' all that glitters is not gold , '' '' what does that mean ? '' '' the patient says , `` '' well , if it 's metallic and shiny , it does n't mean it 's gold . ''
`` you have to measure its specific gravity , ok ? '' '' so , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning . ''
so , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it 's the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . and something very interesting is going on .
and i think it 's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
all of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
thank you .
( applause ) sorry about that .
( laughter )
this story is about taking imagination seriously .
fourteen years ago , i first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
today , i 'm using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
i was an unlikely person to be doing this .
i never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
in fact , after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
i went off on my own to become an artist , and i painted for 10 years , when i was offered a fulbright to india .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .
the deadline for the show arrived — my paints did n't .
i had to do something .
this fishing village was famous for sculpture .
so i tried bronze casting .
but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
i went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
i 'd seen it every day , but this time i saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
`` it 's a self-portrait titled `` '' wide hips . '' '' ( laughter ) we hoisted them on poles to photograph . ''
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
i was mesmerized .
i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in lithuania with lace makers .
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
returning to india to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in madrid .
thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist manual sola-morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto , portugal .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
i did n't know if i could do that and preserve my art .
durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
for two years , i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
so we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america 's cup racing yachts named peter heppel .
he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
i could n't build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots were n't going to withstand a hurricane .
so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
there was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
so we had to create one .
three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
( applause ) this intersection had been bland and anonymous .
now it had a sense of place .
i walked underneath it for the first time .
as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold , i felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
my life was not going to be the same .
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
i 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work .
historic philadelphia city hall : its plaza , i felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an x-ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding .
next challenge , the biennial of the americas in denver asked , could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
( laughter ) i did n't know where to begin , but i said yes .
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .
it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates , sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
so i contacted noaa , and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
`` its title : `` '' 1.26 '' '' refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened . ''
i could n't build this with a steel ring , the way i knew .
its shape was too complex now .
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
the sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
so we had to create it .
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line .
this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
they do n't have funding yet , but i dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed .
fourteen years ago , i searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
now i combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
my artistic horizons continue to grow .
i 'll leave you with this story .
i got a call from a friend in phoenix .
an attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they did n't know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . ( applause )
the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
after puberty , we fall off the map .
she 's a six-monther .
( applause )
so when i was a kid ...
this was my team .
( laughter ) i stunk at sports .
i did n't like to play them , i did n't like to watch them .
so this is what i did . i went fishing .
and for all of my growing up i fished on the shores of connecticut , and these are the creatures that i saw on a regular basis .
but after i grew up and went to college , and i came home in the early 90 's , this is what i found .
my team had shrunk .
it was like literally having your roster devastated .
and as i sort of looked into that , from a very personal point of view as a fisherman , i started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?
first place i started to look was fish markets .
and when i went to fish markets , in spite of where i was — whether i was in north carolina , or paris , or london , or wherever — i kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures , again and again — on the menus , on ice — shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod .
and i thought this was pretty strange , and as i looked at it , i was wondering , did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market ?
well , when i looked into it , i realized that people did n't look at it as their team .
ordinary people , the way they looked at seafood was like this .
it 's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements .
we did it before , 10,000 years ago , when we came out of our caves .
if you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago , you 'll see raccoons , you 'll see , you know , wolves , you 'll see all kinds of different creatures .
it 's true of birds , too .
you look at the menus in new york city restaurants 150 years ago , 200 years ago , you 'll see snipe , woodcock , grouse , dozens of ducks , dozens of geese .
but telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry , and you 'll see four : turkeys , ducks , chicken and geese .
so it makes sense that we 've headed in this direction .
but how have we headed in this direction ?
well ...
first it 's a very , very new problem .
world war ii was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish .
all of the technology that we perfected during world war ii — sonar , lightweight polymers — all these things were redirected towards fish .
and so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity , quadrupling in the course of time , from the end of world war ii to the present time .
and right now that means we 're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year .
that 's the equivalent of the human weight of china taken out of the sea every year .
and it 's no coincidence that i use china as the example because china is now the largest fishing nation in the world .
well , that 's only half the story .
the other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture , which is now , only in the last year or two , starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce .
so that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together , you get the equivalent of two chinas created from the ocean each and every year .
and again , it 's not a coincidence that i use china as the example , because china , in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish , is also the biggest farmer of fish .
so let 's look though at the four choices we are making right now .
the first one — by far the most consumed seafood in america and in much of the west , is shrimp .
shrimp in the wild — as a wild product — is a terrible product .
5 , 10 , 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market .
they 're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market .
in a recent study that was produced out of dalhousie university , it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find .
so you can farm them , and people do farm them , and they farm them a lot in this very area .
problem is ...
the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats — in mangrove forests .
now look at those lovely roots coming down .
those are the things that hold soil together , protect coasts , create habitats for all sorts of young fish , young shrimp , all sorts of things that are important to this environment .
well , this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests .
that rate of destruction has slowed , but we 're still in a major mangrove deficit .
`` the other thing that 's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker mark benjamin called `` '' grinding nemo . '' '' this phenomenon is very , very relevant to anything that you 've ever seen on a tropical reef . ''
because what 's going on right now , we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp , catching a huge amount of bycatch , that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food .
so tuna is this ultimate global fish .
these huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed .
`` the great naturalist carl safina once called it , `` the international conspiracy to catch all the tunas . '' ''
of course we 've seen incredible improvement in iccat in the last few years , there is total room for improvement , but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to manage the globe .
well , we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture .
many people do n't know this but tuna are warm-blooded .
they can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature , they can swim at over 40 miles an hour .
so that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish , right ?
a farmed fish is — or a fish is cold-blooded , it does n't move too much .
that 's a great thing for growing protein .
but if you 've got this crazy , wild creature that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood — not a great candidate for aquaculture .
the next creature — most consumed seafood in america and throughout the west — is salmon .
now salmon got its plundering , too , but it did n't really necessarily happen through fishing .
this is my home state of connecticut .
connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon .
but if you look at this map of connecticut , every dot on that map is a dam .
there are over 3,000 dams in the state of connecticut .
i often say this is why people in connecticut are so uptight — ( laughter ) if somebody could just unblock connecticut 's chi , i feel that we could have an infinitely better world .
`` but i made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers , and this guy from north carolina sidled up to me , he says , `` '' you know , you ought n't be so hard on your connecticut , cause we here in north carolina , we got 35,000 dams . '' '' so it 's a national epidemic , it 's an international epidemic . ''
and there are dams everywhere , and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds .
so as a result , we 've turned to aquaculture , and salmon is one the most successful , at least from a numbers point of view .
when they first started farming salmon , it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon .
the industry has , to its credit , greatly improved .
those pellets are in turn reduced fish .
so the actual — what 's called the fifo , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say .
but in any case , credit to the industry , it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon .
problem is we 've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we 're producing .
aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet .
it 's growing at something like seven percent per year .
and so even though we 're doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we 're still killing a lot of these little fish .
and it 's not just fish that we 're feeding fish to , we 're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs .
so we 've got chickens and they 're eating fish , but weirdly , we also have fish that are eating chickens .
because the byproducts of chickens — feathers , blood , bone — get ground up and fed to fish .
so i often wonder , is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish ?
it 's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing . anyway — ( laughter ) all together , though , it results in a terrible mess .
what you 're talking about is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
that 's the equivalent of a third of a china , or of an entire united states of humans that 's taken out of the sea each and every year .
the last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing .
`` it 's what the industry calls `` '' whitefish . '' '' there are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , i think , is through that classic piece of american culinary innovation , the filet-o-fish sandwich . ''
so the filet-o-fish sandwich actually started as halibut .
because it was a catholic community , they needed fish .
`` so he went to ray kroc and he said , `` i 'm going to bring you a fish sandwich , going to be made out of halibut . '' ''
but let 's do this , let 's have a bet .
`` whosever sandwich sells more , that will be the winning sandwich . '' '' well , it 's kind of sad for the ocean that the hula burger did n't win . ''
so he made his halibut sandwich .
unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .
ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents , so he turned to atlantic cod .
we all know what happened to atlantic cod in new england .
so now the filet-o-fish sandwich is made out of alaska pollock , it 's the largest fin fish fishery in the united states , 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year .
if we go through the pollock , the next choice is probably going to be tilapia .
tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago .
it 's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein , and it 's been a godsend to the third world .
so what do we do ?
i mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the clupeids ?
the fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons .
well , one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them ?
could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon ?
there are arguments for it .
they are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market , a fraction of the fuel cost of say , shrimp , and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale .
they also are omega-3 rich , a great source for epa and dha .
so that is a potential .
and if we were to go down that route what i would say is , instead of paying a few bucks a pound — or a few bucks a ton , really — and making it into aquafeed , could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish ?
other possibility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bivalves , particularly mussels .
now , mussels are very high in epa and dha , they 're similar to canned tuna .
they 're also extremely fuel efficient .
to bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market .
they require no forage fish , they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae .
in fact , that 's where omega-3s come from , they do n't come from fish .
microalgae make the omega-3s , they 're only bioconcentrated in fish .
mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration .
a single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day .
and this is incredibly important when we look at the world .
right now , nitrification , overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms .
over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years , tremendous sources of marine life death .
we also could look at not a fish at all .
they filter the water just like mussels do .
and weirdly enough , it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows .
now , i 'm not a big fan of cattle .
but if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited , you 're growing seaweed in the water , you do n't have to water it — major consideration .
and the last fish is a question mark .
we have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us .
this exists kind of on paper .
i have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years .
`` every time i do a new story , somebody tells me , `` '' we can do all that . we can do it . we 've figured it all out . ''
`` we can produce a fish that 's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s . '' '' great . ''
it does n't seem to be getting scaled up .
it is time to scale this up .
if we do , 30 million metric tons of seafood , a third of the world catch , stays in the water .
so i guess what i 'm saying is this is what we 've been going with .
we tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds .
but if we went with this , or some configuration of it , we might have a little more of this .
thank you .
( applause )
i essentially became an infant in a woman 's body .
if you 've ever seen a human brain , it 's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
excuse me . thank you . it 's been a joy .
information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
i am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
and in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
my left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
and our left hemisphere thinks in language .
and all i could detect was this energy — energy .
`` and i 'm asking myself , `` '' what is wrong with me ? ''
and i felt lighter in my body .
