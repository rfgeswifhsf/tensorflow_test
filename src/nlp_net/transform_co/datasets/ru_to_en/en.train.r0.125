and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
they may have to be dealt with with military means , but they can not be solved by military means .
and my country relies on its security through military alliance , that 's clear .
now everybody agrees .
we did n't grasp what was going on .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bottom-up — people 's revolution .
social groups are taking to the streets .
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
`` it 's their right to fight . '' '' now as you know , mandela did n't do that . ''
and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
sometimes you have to .
we are seeing some new signs .
what is it that makes people trust each other , not only between states , but also within states ?
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they can not be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?
( applause )
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
there are the retail shops , the cafes and the restaurants , and the community is this community of coptic christians , so you 'll also find a church , along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area , and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops , the barbers , everything .
many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously , putting a lot of work and care into the details .
when i was let in , it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm , where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room .
the attention to this detail astonished me , and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment , from floor to ceiling , every part was decorated .
i would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration , zita cobb , the founder of the wonderful shorefast foundation , based out of fogo island , newfoundland .
and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , i 'm really struck by the things that we have in common .
in fact , when i travel to the developing world , coke feels ubiquitous .
`` and so when i come back from these trips , and i 'm thinking about development , and i 'm flying home and i 'm thinking , `` we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations , '' you know , coke 's success kind of stops and makes you wonder : how is it that they can get coke to these far-flung places ? ''
but i think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn .
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
so why does this matter ?
so they take the data , and they use it to measure progress .
`` it 's dark , you ca n't see which one goes down until the lights come on , and then you an see your impact . '' '' real-time data turns on the lights . ''
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
let 's look at the development side .
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic , they were over a day 's travel away from a health clinic .
health extension workers can help with so many things , whether it 's family planning , prenatal care , immunizations for the children , or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery .
and it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries .
`` it reminds me of a song that i remember from my childhood , `` i 'd like to teach the world to sing , '' that also went number one on the pop charts . ''
so how does health and development market ?
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation .
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that should n't be done in the village , and they agree to that .
( laughter ) i 'm not kidding .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
so many more people would have been affected .
they went out and where shriram lives , they vaccinated two million people .
so we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we 're about to run short of money .
and we are so close .
and this victory is so possible .
( applause )
i would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what 's past the 15 minutes , i 'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what 's in here .
so , the car — the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage — was a big deal ; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .
so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy .
but think about where the world is today .
over the last hundred years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way , and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that .
china alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half .
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air , and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices , particularly sitting in cities .
so it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile , and it was dumb luck . we were working on ibots , but once we made this , we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis . you do n't need the water .
they 've gotten bigger ; they 're spread out .
the 20 largest cities in the world .
what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this , as that last link to mass transit , to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want , and then have our cities energized again ?
i have the same footprint as a pedestrian ; i have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space .
and i ca n't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket .
we went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted .
the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals .
but if you could put a pin in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one half-hour , it 's the city .
this little beast , right now , is producing a few hundred watts of electricity .
but more interestingly , the thermodynamics of this say , you 're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency .
and women should n't have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it’s the most exciting job i’ve ever had .
( laughter ) but in any case , what i’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .
and this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do .
so it’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we’re in , and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere , that makes science work .
not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
of who else there is , of the history and so forth .
space is just one aspect , so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is .
so there’s an interesting discussion going on there .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
if it wasn’t for gravity , there wouldn’t be life , because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time , keeping pieces of the world , like the surface of the earth , out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve .
and slowly , that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences , the human sciences , economics , et cetera .
any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships .
you can remake your streets quickly , inexpensively , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular .
they changed signals , they changed lanes , everything they could do to make times square work better .
and the temporary materials are an important part of the program , because we were able to show how it worked .
and this is an important lesson , because it does n't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space .
it was like a star trek episode , you know ?
and the lawn chairs became the talk of the town .
this is in bed-stuy , brooklyn , and you can see the short leg that was there , used for cars , that 's not really needed .
all told , we 've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city .
you 're seeing this kind of approach , since we 've painted times square , you 've seen this approach in boston , in chicago , in san francisco , in mexico city , buenos aires , you name it .
but i ca n't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods .
we also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program , and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in new york .
bike volumes have spiked .
people have ridden seven million miles .
i think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched citi bike , and i was riding citi bike up first avenue in my protected bike lane , and i looked over and i saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands , and the traffic was flowing , birds were singing — ( laughter ) — the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes .
so i want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that 's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
you see there , it 's about 620 billion a year .
`` the first thing i want to say , and this is straight from `` '' wonders of the solar system , '' '' is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful . ''
so that big sweeping , white sphere in the corner is saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture .
and that crescent there is the moon enceladus , which is about as big as the british isles .
it 's about 500 kilometers in diameter .
that 's fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .
but that 's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
but by measuring the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we 've inferred very strongly that there 's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa .
so below the ice , there 's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
it was taken by apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
the biggest one was in 1975 by chase econometrics .
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , i think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
what about driving innovation ?
and so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms — the same theory that describes transistors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
well , this is a picture of it .
there are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it 's shining out so brightly .
that 's a type ia supernova explosion .
now that 's an incredible phenomena , because it 's a star that sits there .
it sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the sun .
and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
but that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet .
you could have made it in the 1890s ; you would n't have the transistor .
surely , we know enough .
let me leave the last words to someone who 's rapidly becoming a hero of mine , humphrey davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century .
so tonight i 'd like to tell you about the intersection that i 'm most excited about at this very moment , which is entertainment and robotics .
i 'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology .
`` `` i 've been trying to contact you since yesterday . '' ''
he does not seem to be breathing .
( applause ) you 've been a great audience .
thank you very much .
we 're looking at a lot of compounds , but recently been quite interested in the flame retardants , the brominated flame retardants that are in many , many things that we use in our everyday life , from the cushions in the chairs we 're all sitting on to the plastic casings of our computers , our television sets and so on .
and there 's quite a complicated pathway for that because , as these products age , they get concentrated in dust , and then they also get thrown out , so they go to the landfills .
and they 're allowed to keep trade secrets , so they do n't even give the ingredients out .
i felt like my throat was on fire .
and what i did see in the water as we went down , what really shocked me — and it 's haunted me ever since — because i could see the droplets of oil dispersing .
and as you know , there 's been a very weak response , up until recently , to actually collect the oil .
and then there 's the problem of the plumes .
derivatives , derivatives , these are whole big groups of many , many compounds , these sorbitans .
and then you get down to the petroleum distillates , which are the solvents , hundreds of them .
trade secrets again .
what we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard .
i could see myself easily in the water column .
they were replaced by invasive species , which had less holding power to the rock .
my question to you is : why should n't we know ?
whatever it is , please let us have the truth .
boo hewerdine , thomas dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . it 's been a blessing singing for you .
just to put everything in context , and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from , so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say , and the things i 'm going to do — or things i 'm going to tell you i 've done — you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to be where i am .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's 13-year-old car — and i was a paid doctor .
how many people do you think are on that taxi ?
`` and like i tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , `` you 're risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country . '' ''
you can say it 's hygiene . i 'm not pleading poverty .
open-heart surgery in nigeria — big trouble .
that 's mike , mike comes out from mississippi .
( laughter ) i got him to come with me — anesthesia tech — come with me from the u.k .
but how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
`` so , we put my hand in my pocket and say , `` '' guys , let 's just buy stuff . ''
this is what makes it so special .
( applause )
this means that two brains of the same size , like these two , with a respectable 400 grams , should have similar numbers of neurons .
i think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex , elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are .
`` so this is a first indication that the `` '' all brains are made the same way '' '' scenario is not quite right . ''
so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
so the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes .
maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
but nobody did .
now , the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup , you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid , so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution , you can count nuclei , and therefore tell how many cells that brain had .
well , what about our brain then ?
and all of you are primates .
well , other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs , and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of , we could do the math .
we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods , and on the other hand , how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs , and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
and what we found is that because neurons are so expensive , there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons .
cooked foods are softer , so they 're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth , so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut , which makes them yield much more energy in much less time .
so because of cooking , what once was a major liability , this large , dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons , could now become a major asset , now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them .
with this large brain now affordable by cooking , we went rapidly from raw foods to culture , agriculture , civilization , grocery stores , electricity , refrigerators , all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint .
studying the human brain changed the way i think about food .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
thank you very much .
all of them are different colors , they 're rippling with different frequencies , and they 're bouncing off every surface , including me , and some of those are flying directly into your eyes , and that 's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
there are other costs , because powerpoint is a tool , and like any tool , it can and will be abused .
one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts .
however , once we eliminate public funding for the arts , there will be some drawbacks .
i 'm really scared .
it 's not a movie . this is real life .
that is not enough .
here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes .
it means that i pay only for what i need .
so , here 's a woman that reserved minimia , and she had her day .
the social result is that today 's zipcar has 100,000 members driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces .
instead of driving 12,000 miles a year , which is what the average city dweller does , they drive 500 miles a year . are they happy ?
today , 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles , yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool .
the average american spends 19 percent of their income on their car , and there 's a pressure for them to reduce that cost , yet they have no outlet today .
we 've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982 .
you were n't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates .
whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing .
we need to put this better market feedback .
and wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible .
you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and i 'm going to be the wise businessman .
`` `` i want to say one word to you , just one word . '' ''
i 'm going to give you some examples .
you 'll be hearing later today from alan kay .
you can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it 's coming , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
again , all mesh-enabled . monthly communication cost : zero .
what are the incredible weaknesses ?
these things are going to happen .
maybe we should use a good one . when are we going to do it ?
we should pull it forward .
we have this incredible excess capacity .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i 'd like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
they destroy stars around them .
einstein realized that if space were empty , if the universe were empty , it would be like this picture , except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .
it was einstein 's great general theory of relativity .
these are the natural curves in space .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
there 's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
if this were battlestar galactica and you 're fighting the cylons , do n't hide behind the black hole .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we could n't , anymore than light can escape .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes — each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
and if you can see — it 's kind of faint — but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
this is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
we know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
now i 've never heard it that loud — it 's actually more dramatic .
this is another sound from my group .
but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this , you want to get moving .
luckily we 're at this safe distance in long beach , california .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
and lisa will be able to see super-massive black holes — black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun .
they look like they 're frozen in some embrace .
`` when that expression was coined , it was derisive — like , `` '' oh , who would believe in a big bang ? '' '' but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang . ''
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
will it happen again ?
mom , i 'm really trying .
it is not arming our country to the teeth .
and he 's a bad guy . he 's like a bad kid in church .
`` your robe gives it away . '' '' ( laughter ) he said , `` '' you know that i kind of like meditation , and i pray . '' '' i said , `` '' that 's good . that 's good . ''
`` i think what we need is action . '' '' his holiness , in his robes , is my new action hero . ''
i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago .
but i do n't believe in hope without endeavor .
`` i do n't believe in the hope of change , unless we take action to make it so . '' '' here 's another woman hero of mine . ''
the children were killed on the spot .
some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month .
there were others , like myself , who were full-time .
so before going to law school in china i bought a banjo , i threw it in my little red truck and i traveled down through appalachia and i learned a bunch of old american songs , and i ended up in kentucky at the international bluegrass music association convention .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
go get it , girl .
`` [ chinese ] `` big sister wong , '' washburn , wong , same difference . ''
and in that moment , we were n't our american selves , we were n't our chinese selves , we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here .
`` i began `` '' the vagina monologues '' '' because i was worried about vaginas . ''
and that 's actually the good news .
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure .
you ca n't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time , as they might confuse you or challenge you .
or at least , that 's what you say when you identify yourself .
you have places you can not go , thoughts you can not think , worlds that you can no longer inhabit .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that 's right next to this world .
i 've discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
they have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator .
i want to talk about a few of these people that i 've met .
that will happen because women in cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line , and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in egypt , and were willing to be attacked and criticized .
and in this meeting — it went on for weeks in the press , two weeks where there was huge discussion .
`` the government finally made a decision that `` '' the vagina monologues '' '' could not be performed in uganda . ''
as a result , this production , which had already sold out , every single person in that 800-seat audience , except for 10 people , made a decision to keep the money .
they raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred .
they told her she could n't love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing .
( laughter ) now this seems like a fairly , you know , frivolous , but what happened as a result of that , is that that school now is forming a sex education class . it 's beginning to talk about sex , it 's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly .
she made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard , but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls .
in the year she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut .
the end goal will [ be ] becoming vulnerable , realizing the place of our connection to one another , rather than becoming secure , in control and alone .
thank you very much .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
this video we took undercover , which shows you , over a half an hour period , a tray of medicines of 42 vials , which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in india .
these kids in pakistan do n't go to school .
and they are collected en mass — you can see the scale of it here — and sorted out , by hand , back into the right sizes , and then put back out on the street .
and these are used with traces of blood visible .
you give the injection and then put it down .
and in comparison , a coca-cola is 10 times the price .
and we 're very proud of giving information to people , so that little kids like this do n't do stupid things .
salaam . namaskar .
not me .
when so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes — honor , religion , nationality — what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
my aunt , an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman , was widowed early .
they took off her colorful sari .
`` this is tradition . '' '' that 's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world . ''
but barely six months into my new job , i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions .
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states .
she is also immensely pragmatic .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
she is on the taliban 's hit list .
i worry about her every time she travels across that country .
in post-conflict societies like croatia , where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast .
so enter a group of out dykes , young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia , from serbia to slovenia .
in the middle ages , troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses : lesbor travels through the balkans like this , singing , connecting people divided by religion , nationality and language .
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades .
`` as leymah said , `` '' we wore the white saying we were out for peace . '' '' they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day . ''
eventually , opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana .
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf , a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years .
that 's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades .
and in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men .
how did movember start ?
`` and a few more beers , i said , `` '' there has to be some stuff that has n't come back . '' '' ( laughter ) then one more beer and it was , whatever happened to the mustache ? ''
my girlfriend at the time , who 's no longer my girlfriend — ( laughter ) — hated it .
and we sat down , and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia , raising awareness for this cause , and funds for his organization . and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that .
`` an ultraconservative organization . '' '' ( laughter ) i 've heard this before . i know how it goes . ''
so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets .
`` your mom would be so proud . '' '' and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache , having a joke . ''
you might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
i was clapping . they were clapping .
all of these books are well-intentioned .
i see anxiety .
i see a giant candy-colored monument to our collective panic , and it makes me want to know , why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion ?
parents experience more stress than non-parents .
we are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script , and if you 're an amazing jazz musician , then improv is great , but for the rest of us , it can kind of feel like a crisis .
until fairly recently , kids worked , on our farms primarily , but also in factories , mills , mines .
it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for .
and with all due respect to the japanese , it did n't turn out that way .
we sign them up for team sports , thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills , you know , for when they go to harvard business school .
now , in a more progressive country , and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché and invoking , yes , sweden , parents could rely on the state for support .
in this age of intense confusion , there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree , and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms , helicopters or drones , our kids ' happiness is paramount .
but the thing that stuck with me is she said that she did n't know whether oscar the grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive .
i can not tell you how much this distresses me .
i was high as a kite on morphine .
in fact , as any parent will tell you , it 's awfully hard .
thank you .
it flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall .
so , that 's how it walks . but when you look at us human being , bipedal walking , what you 're doing is you 're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot . right ?
the one in front , the smaller , is strider ii .
so , in this video we 're using an approach called the reactive approach .
this is a very high mobility robot that we developed called impass .
it affects the diameter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right .
so , these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with impass .
so , i 've been talking to a lot of nasa jpl scientists — at jpl they are famous for the mars rovers — and the scientists , geologists always tell me that the real interesting science , the science-rich sites , are always at the cliffs .
but the current rovers can not get there .
and also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine .
this robot is a very recent project . it 's called raphael .
the cable over there , that 's an optical fiber .
for those who probably know , if you do n't have any sensors and there are any disturbances , you know what happens .
it 's an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
and the goal of robocup , the actual goal is , by the year 2050 we want to have full size , autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win .
the robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful louis vuitton cup trophy .
this is the next generation robot , darwin iv , but smarter , faster , stronger .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
at night when i go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning , i lie down , close my eyes , and i see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around .
every day in the morning , the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee , before i brush my teeth , i open my notebook .
i have linear algebra , science , physics , even nowadays , chemistry and biology , as you 've seen .
these examples might seem inconsequential and harmless , but they 're insidious , slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people .
the first is the sexy bombshell .
`` `` gross . '' ''
`` `` how ? '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` not worth the trouble . '' `` not worth the risk . '' ''
i 've taken to calling this the willendorf effect , and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life .
many of us do n't know this because doctors do n't trust pregnant women with this secret — ( laughter ) especially if she 's less educated or a woman of color .
that is a woman who insists that you make room for her at the table of power , and that is the most terrifying of all because we ca n't make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold .
( applause ) i have one last secret for you .
for starters , we have got to stop telling women what they can and can not do with their bodies .
if you do n't know her , do n't even ask to touch her belly .
and today , as a cruciverbalist — 23 points — and an illusion designer , i create that chaos .
i test your ability to solve .
like .
( laughter ) now , solving exists across all cultures .
china gives us tangrams , which would test solvers ' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces .
we are always trying to decode our world .
okay , stand right here , gwen , right here .
it 's going to be a lot of fun .
and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap . is n't this fun ?
color in the owl .
do n't open it yet . do not open it yet , but i am going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made .
okay , great . so we have a cobalt horse , amber owl , a silver ox , yes , okay , a red donkey , and what was the emerald color ? a rooster .
really dig . we hid them under there .
you can see my name above the grid .
and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
but you seem to have more hair .
voice : what kind of disease ?
bp : i heard momma and tizzy whisper , and they said i was gon na die soon .
and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character .
and it 's not a special effects film ; it has to be a man .
the state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .
but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking , and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .
and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers .
our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day , the status quo , the state of the art .
and of course , these transcend age , race , culture , gender .
`` this is when we 're like , `` '' ok , we 're going to be ok , this is actually going to work . '' '' and the `` '' aha ! '' '' was , what if we could take brad pitt , and we could put brad in this device , and use this contour process , and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights , and we could , in fact , scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses . ''
so now , we had a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face can do at age 87 , in his 70s and in his 60s .
but now we needed to get brad 's performance to drive our virtual benjamin .
we encouraged him to improvise .
we shot him with four hd cameras so we 'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .
and so we could choose , say , his left eyebrow .
on a frame-by-frame basis , we could actually reconstruct a 3d head that exactly matched the performance of brad .
we worked from dental molds of brad .
we had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months .
the skin had to be absolutely accurate .
there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance .
every morning as a child , i 'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard .
it has to be said , the shipyard was not the most pleasant place to live next door to , or indeed work in .
this is jackie white .
or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of 15 .
but sometimes a father 's love can be misconstrued as controlling , and conversely , the scope of his son 's ambition can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy .
it was n't like that in my day , but we still got very excited .
we 're having a moment , me and the queen mother .
i was infected with an idea .
i want to be in that car . ( laughter ) i want a bigger life .
okay , you have to join in if you know it .
all stories interest me , and some haunt me until i end up writing them .
certain themes keep coming up : justice , loyalty , violence , death , political and social issues , freedom .
this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag .
it is all about passion .
( applause ) in the green room of the stadium , i met the other flag bearers : three athletes , and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren .
when she was 14 years old , her grandfather sold her to a brothel .
i do n't know .
( laughter ) a place where most men would love to be . ( laughter )
they are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity .
call it aphrodite , or venus , or bimbo , or whatever you want ; the name does n't matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it .
the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh .
jenny has a brave and passionate heart .
that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth .
the husband , furious , threatens to kill the american .
the day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him .
in any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . they are collateral damage .
men run the world , and look at the mess we have .
abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom .
we need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men .
i want to make this world good .
let 's get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world .
normal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes , it was best to listen to my parents even when i did n't exactly understand why .
before i could say anything , tell him how foolish he had made me look in front of my friends , he derided me for being so naive .
but we began with a family-planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities .
not just child mortality alone , you need also family planning .
there was just no future .
we went to the nurses and the midwives , who were also women , and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill .
`` what do we do for the other 80 percent — leave them alone and say , `` '' well , they 're not medical personnel . '' '' no , we decided to do a bit more . ''
they were well-known in the community , they knew that customers were always right , and they were terrific , and they practiced their family planning themselves .
so we went to the teachers .
and before long , the condom was know as the girl 's best friend .
and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it — very appropriate room .
`` and he said , `` '' mechai , could you come and join ? '' '' he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot . ''
so they were happy with that .
so they all trained .
`` and also , in traffic , the policemen give you condoms — our `` '' cops and rubbers '' '' programs . ''
( laughter ) so , can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms ?
imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people .
`` one says , `` '' weapon of mass protection . '' '' we found — you know — somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction , but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom . ''
stop global warming ; use condoms .
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
they plant the trees , and the money goes into their microcredit fund , which we call the village development bank .
now we 're making scottish tartans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of scottish ancestors .
can you imagine , at every starbucks that you can also get condoms ?
are they talking to one another ?
they 've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries .
keep it quiet please . settle down .
15 seconds studio .
`` `` come on adam , do n't be so wishy-washy . take a bite . '' `` i did . '' ''
`` `` '' i do n't know , guys . ''
they can have one marshmallow now . but if they wait until the experimenter comes back , they can have two .
what happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation .
they can not wait . the others , of course , wait .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat .
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .
what determines any decision you make ?
for some people it 's only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you 're feeling .
well there is actually six of them . there are two ways to be present-oriented .
there is two ways to be past-oriented , two ways to be future .
told me do n't eat that marshmallow , because if you wait you 're going to get two of them , until i learned to balance out .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they 're not really going away .
and because these materials are so prolific , because they 're found in so many places , there 's one other place you 'll find this material , styrene , which is made from benzene , a known carcinogen .
i say far less , because 10 percent is n't going to cut it .
yet that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years .
and what they 're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system , which cleans , cooks , cools and pasteurizes these materials , while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium .
so in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
but it 's much faster than conventional farming .
so i quit my dream job , and i moved to new orleans , and i kept on studying how the oil spill was happening .
what 's happening is that , because the boat changes shape , the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind .
so what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology .
the other thing is , most boats , when they reach a certain speed , and they are going on waves , they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water , and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost .
so what is open hardware ?
this is a proud member of protei from korea , and on the right side , this is a multiple-masts design proposed by a team in mexico .
they also made it into an instructable , and in less than one week , they had almost 10,000 views , and they got many new friends .
that 's why i was there , i wanted to invite them to look and explore .
and other things that i do n't — are n't familiar with .
so that we can stop compartmentalizing form , function and aesthetic , and assigning them different values .
nobody knew — everyone thought they were wooden boots .
actually , i have them on stage with me : grapevines , magnolias — truly stunning .
`` and she looked at me , and she said , `` '' but , aimee , that 's not fair . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the incredible thing was she really meant it . ''
kt : no .
kt : god .
kb : now , anything coming at all ? kt : no .
ok , excellent . open your eyes .
man : yes .
now , steve , you know where the spike is , but nobody else , does ? correct ?
ok , give me both hands .
and it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity .
i had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to democratic opposition groups in eastern europe , like solidarity in poland , when i was in my teens .
like this character . remember these guys ?
that means your police force was n't working .
and i could n't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates .
the congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons , and the mafia would then sell it on to western markets .
it was the liberalization of international financial markets .
bernie madoff stole 65 billion dollars .
and that is narcotics . our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning .
and it has no rules to its regulatory system .
it 's really not that difficult .
but over the past year or so , researchers in cambodia have discovered that what 's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance .
and they fear that the reason why it 's developing a resistance is because cambodians ca n't afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the internet .
it 's been a privilege talking to you .
please raise your hand if something applies to you .
( laughter ) it 's okay , it 's safe here .
mmm .
mmm .
have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone ?
have you ever realized that very little , in the long run , just happens naturally ?
congratulations .
you have now completed the test .
( applause )
scientists tell us that the world is warming .
he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind .
we ca n't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases .
a physicist can not tell you , despite the claims of some of them , whether or not tobacco causes cancer .
we were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims .
`` according to the standard model , the textbook model , scientists develop hypotheses , they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses , and then they go out into the world and they say , `` okay , well are those consequences true ? '' ''
one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein .
this is a picture of the ptolemaic universe with the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it .
and many people argued that this proved that the copernican model was false .
well , in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses , both of which we would now say were incorrect .
so he started collecting data .
when he collected these finches , he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant .
besides inductive science , scientists also often participate in modeling .
so he built this model , this crazy contraption with levers and wood , and here 's his wheelbarrow , buckets , a big sledgehammer .
maybe it 's going to rain .
how can we know what 's causing the observed warming ?
so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth 's climate , so sulfate particles from air pollution , volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions , changes in solar radiation , and , of course , greenhouse gases .
the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together , including greenhouse gases , and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last 50 years .
we can also think of science as being a kind of a jury , except it 's a very special kind of jury .
`` that 's what scientists call `` '' intractable . '' '' but this leads us to one final problem : if science is what scientists say it is , then is n't that just an appeal to authority ? ''
it 's the authority of the collective community .
you can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd , but a very special kind of crowd .
it 's based on the collective wisdom , the collective knowledge , the collective work , of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem .
the modern automobile hardly ever breaks down .
they have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it , and it means that we have to become better listeners .
we grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
if i put a boarding pass , it will show me where the flight gate is .
i think that 's why this is called a head-mounted projector , is n't it ?
( applause ) thank you .
i removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that — like i just made a clip out of the microphone — and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper .
when i come back to my desk , i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer .
and i think , quite frankly , that 's where i started .
and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto , and not have to re-invent myself — that this theme was large enough to become a life 's work , to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are .
so in that respect , to me , i 'm not against the corporation .
and it 's a scary thing as well . because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles , and what we 're doing to that landscape — that , to me , is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate .
and i was shut out of india because of a greenpeace situation there , and then i was able to get into bangladesh , and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it , that i had never actually thought was possible .
so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reservoirs ever created .
and this gives you an idea .
and there 's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers .
what 's also happening in shanghai is — china is changing because this would n't have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a holdout .
and they 've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal .
and what we would see here as a suburban development — a similar thing , but they 're all high-rises .
and what you 're seeing here is , again , one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills .
there are 500 of these machines ; they 're worth about 200,000 dollars each .
and that 's a diptych . i do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places .
this floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
these are just recently shot — i just came back about a month ago , so you 're the first ones to be seeing these , these new factory pictures i 've taken .
the other aspect of what 's happening in china is that there 's a real need for materials there .
fifty percent of the world 's computers end up in china to be recycled .
but the toxic smells — when you come into a town that 's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards , you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there .
here 's another operation . it 's all cottage industries , so it 's not big places — it 's all in people 's front porches , in their backyards , even in their homes they 're burning boards , if there 's a concern for somebody coming by — because it is considered in china to be illegal , doing it , but they ca n't stop the product from coming in .
one 's megan , the one of the right , and katja there .
oh , and i went in search — i wanted to put what i had in mind , hitch it onto something . i did n't want a wish just to start from nowhere .
so it 's this great window where they actually are — you can influence them . you know what happens at puberty ?
and when qatar has been assigned to the world cup all , many people around the world have been wondering , how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football , run around in this desert climate ? how would it be possible that spectators sit , enjoy themselves in open-air stadia in this hot environment ?
what about seoul ? seoul , because of broadcast rights , all the games have been in the late afternoon . sun has already been set , so the games have been perceived as comfortable .
so we sat together with a team which prepared the bid book , or goal , that we said , let 's aim for perceived temperature , for outdoor comfort in this range , which is perceived with a temperature of 32 degrees celsius perceived temperature , which is extremely comfortable .
we 're using energy we can harvest on our roofs , and also on the training pitches , which will be covered with large , flexible membranes , and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics , giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time .
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the grid of qatar .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer 's .
i see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
they come to a certain point and then stop .
`` i said , `` '' is this like a dream ? '' '' and she said , `` '' no , it 's not like a dream . it 's like a movie . '' '' she said , `` '' it 's got color . it 's got motion . ''
she had no control over them .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind .
i work in old-age homes , largely .
and he knew it was a hallucination .
`` so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , `` '' and who are these handsome young men with you ? '' '' and they said , `` '' alas , grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . '' '' and then the handsome young men disappeared . ''
charles lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
she had very mobile hallucinations as well .
a lot of them had to do with a car .
why kermit ?
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
in particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you 're going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
and you 're waiting for your girl .
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations — the pink and blue squares the woman had — up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
so , what is going on ?
and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
`` `` '' face cells '' '' were discovered around 1970 . ''
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
suddenly this , and suddenly that .
think of the number of blind people .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
charles bonnet said , 250 years ago — he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
if we could reduce the usage of paper towels , one paper towel per person per day , 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used .
`` joe smith : your word is `` '' fold . '' '' audience : fold . ''
why 12 ? twelve apostles , twelve tribes , twelve zodiac signs , twelve months . the one i like the best : it 's the biggest number with one syllable .
( laughter ) audience : shake . fold .
and you get half a towel .
and next year , toilet paper .
`` it brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation . '' '' if shivering is a form of meditation , then i would consider myself a monk . ''
you see , the more time i spent traveling to these exotic locations , the less gratifying it seemed to be .
and it was my first trip to iceland that i felt like i found exactly what i was looking for .
and one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there : hours , days , weeks spent on google earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to .
and once we got there , the vehicles were just as creative : snowmobiles , six-wheel soviet troop carriers , and a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights .
( laughter ) helicopters really scare me , by the way .
and i realized , all this shivering had actually taught me something : in life , there are no shortcuts to joy .
see , i gave a piece of myself in these places , and what i walked away with was a sense of fulfillment i had always been searching for .
when we think about accidents , we usually consider them to be harmful , unfortunate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
the discovery that had led to penicillin , for example , is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time .
in 2011 , we visited the vancouver waste transfer station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste .
as a result , they easily escape into our environment .
not only do phthalates pollute our environment , but they also pollute our bodies .
they can be absorbed by skin contact , ingested , and inhaled .
mw : so we presented this good idea to dr. lindsay eltis at the university of british columbia , and surprisingly , he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students adam and james to help us .
to do this , we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid .
our bacteria can transform phthalates , which is a harmful toxin , into end products such as carbon dioxide , water and alcohol .
and perhaps one day we 'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste .
( applause )
he said , you know , there 's this fiscal cliff coming , it 's going to come at the beginning of 2013 .
`` they just fought off a king . they 're not going to accept some central authority . '' '' this battle defined the first 150 years of the u.s. economy , and at every moment , different partisans saying , `` oh my god , the economy 's about to collapse , '' and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy . ''
people say we should call it the fiscal slope , or we should call it an austerity crisis , but then other people say , no , that 's even more partisan .
and as you can see , for most of recent history , except for a brief period , we have consistently spent more than we take in . thus the national debt .
the republicans say , hey , no , no , we 've got a better idea .
why do n't we lower government spending and lower government taxes , and then we 'll be on an even more favorable long-term deficit trajectory ?
and when i picture how democrats and democratic-leaning economists picture this economy , most democratic economists are , you know , they 're capitalists , they believe , yes , that 's a good system a lot of the time .
wealth is ripped away from people who should n't be called unproductive .
and i can get really despairing . i 've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , i learned something that i felt really excited about . i feel like it 's really good news , and it 's so shocking , i do n't like saying it , because i think people wo n't believe me .
so when we 're talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we 're talking about , and americans overwhelmingly , and it does n't matter what party they 're in , overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk .
so gradually raise social security retirement age , maybe only on people not yet born .
raise medical health care contributions ?
and so what this tells me is , when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems , we are not a nation that 's powerfully divided on the major , major issue .
now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we do n't care , spend some more , and that of course is republicans when it comes to military defense spending .
but that is not the case at all .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
roughly a third of americans say that they are democrats .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
you were in what they called the saltwater camp , meaning harvard , princeton , mit , stanford , berkeley , or you were in the freshwater camp , university of chicago , university of rochester .
the vast majority of economists — it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
`` or , `` '' do you think the government should redistribute ? '' '' then you can see radical partisan change . ''
and that gets me back to the dollar , and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience .
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy , but as a place that ca n't resolve its own fights , and the longer we put that off , the more we make the world nervous , the higher interest rates are going to be , the quicker we 're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity .
and his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients .
so i called barry , and with his blessing , in october 1995 walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center .
and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two , three , sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable .
the real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment .
i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is .
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy .
it 's just a set of choices that people make .
they will be used for our purposes .
we started with the prescription pad — a very ordinary piece of paper — and we asked , not what do patients need to get healthy — antibiotics , an inhaler , medication — but what do patients need to be healthy , to not get sick in the first place ?
so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center , when patients come into the doctor 's office , they 're asked a few questions .
the problem is , once you get a taste of what it 's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare , you want more .
and we gave it a shot .
so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index , the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for health leads .
and that 's what health leads has tried to do , to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy .
but if we 're creative , we already have that too .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
what are we going to do about it ?
you know that part of us that still crosses the street , locks the doors , clutches the purses , when we see young black men ?
how much better would our lives be ? how much better would our country be ?
`` because i do this work every day , and i see all my biases . '' '' i mean , not too long ago , i was on a plane and i heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the p.a . system , and i was just so excited , so thrilled . ''
`` if you ask me explicitly , i would say , `` '' female pilot : awesome . '' '' but it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome , a little risky , i lean on a bias that i did n't even know that i had . ''
i 'm going to tell you what we have learned .
the implicit association test , which measures unconscious bias , you can go online and take it .
what do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates ?
it 's not the hardest thing to do , but it 's also one of these things where you have to be conscious and intentional about it .
`` i 've got a 6'5 '' '' black guy son . i was married to a black guy . ''
so i 'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort .
because , you know what ? just look around your periphery .
not everyone is out to get you .
that 's how we create a community where everybody , especially young black men , can thrive .
when we see something , we have to have the courage to say something , even to the people we love .
we know they 're good people , but what they 're saying is wrong .
and we wonder why these biases do n't die , and move from generation to generation ?
`` no one deserves that . '' '' and we 've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents do n't have the luxury to do so , especially those who have young black sons . ''
thank you .
and you do n't have sex .
and i 'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
`` you know , `` '' design — bad design , there 's just no excuse for it . ''
`` good design , '' '' my dad said , `` '' is about supplying intent . '' '' that 's what he said . ''
dad helped design the control panels for the ibm 360 computer .
`` anybody ? '' '' i do n't like to talk about this very much , but i 'll tell you guys the story today . ''
`` people going , `` '' awesome wheels , dude ! those are awesome ! ''
`` i guess they 're for safety , right ? '' '' ( laughter ) no ! they 're not for safety . ''
what 's the difference here , the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights ?
but as a dysfunctional , as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic , he 's something much more complicated .
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from .
now here 's an example a little closer to home : my family is all about intent .
and after a couple very liberating weekends , my wife and i , utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i wo n't get into it now , we noticed some familiar , if unexpected , symptoms .
no , i do n't think a designer did come up with that .
hey , the name ajax — you ca n't get much more intentional than that , right ?
i did love some great designs as i was growing up : the hp 35s calculator — god , i loved that thing . oh god , i wish i had one .
`` he designed a state in `` '' the republic , '' '' a design never implemented . ''
but look at that statement ; it 's all about intent . that 's what i love about it .
here 's my favorite design moment : in the city of kinshasa in zaire in the 1990s , i was working for abc news , and i was reporting on the fall of mobutu sese seko , the dictator , the brutal dictator in zaire , who raped and pillaged that country .
there was rioting in the middle of kinshasa .
`` he goes , `` '' hey , mister ! mister ! '' '' and i looked at him — he did n't know any other english than that , but we did n't need english , no , no , no , no , no . ''
and i pose this question .
`` `` nurse ! is this the 28th or the 29th ? '' ''
`` and she looked at me and said , `` it 's march 1st . '' ''
intent — a life with intent — lived by design , covering the original with something better .
the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them .
well , they 're looking at celestial cues in the sky , some of which you and i ca n't see .
that was what was of interest to us next .
he does a little dance , he turns around , and heads back in this . he knows exactly where he 's going .
so what we did was design a couple of arenas .
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face , and all the time it 's trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across .
this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior .
so let 's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment .
but i want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental .
i 'm referring to the recycling of these old post-war bungalows that mexican contractors bring to the border as american developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades .
this layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice .
so while , as an architect , this is a very compelling thing to witness , this creative intelligence , i also want to keep myself in check .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of bermuda triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
now for many of you , this story might seem trivial or naive .
for me as an architect , it has become a fundamental narrative , because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability .
i want to say this and emphasize it , because this is the only way i see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today .
( applause )
and that 's not a joke , we really do .
so , actually , i started working on what 's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound .
and this is a spearing mantis shrimp , or stomatopod .
and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack .
so , the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end , or it can smash with the heel .
and so the first question that came to mind was , well , how fast does this limb move ?
and low light is a critical issue with filming animals , because if it 's too high , you fry them . ( laughter ) so this is a mantis shrimp . there are the eyes up here , and there 's that raptorial appendage , and there 's the heel .
so the muscle contracts , and nothing happens .
this was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes .
and it 's surrounded by membranous areas . and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure .
and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while .
and then we did a series of calculations , and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring .
so we thought , ok , this must be a spring — the saddle could very well be a spring .
i purchased a 100-pound load cell , thinking , no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal .
and i got all these force measurements , and then i went and looked at the force output of the system .
but there 's a really large second peak half a millisecond later , and i did n't know what that was .
and so here it is in the stomatopod . and again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers .
and again , we can see it in slightly different form there , with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces .
very , very convenient solution to that particular problem .
and i think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon .
and so i 'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike , or their strike force , and something about the time period in the molting cycle .
so to conclude , i mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators , wyatt korff and roy caldwell , who worked closely with me on this .
patrick was born in liberia to a family of 20 children .
he wanted to continue to higher education , but due to his family living on the poverty line , he was soon sent to south africa to work and send back money to feed his family .
the higher education system failed patrick , debbie and wael , exactly as it is failing millions of potential students , millions that graduate high school , millions that are qualified for higher education , millions that want to study yet can not access for various reasons .
higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few .
we — ( applause ) — thank you .
we just looked at what was n't working and used the amazing power of the internet to get around it .
finally , it 's our belief in peer-to-peer learning .
with 5,000 students in 2016 , this model is financially sustainable .
( applause )
it 's because the ocean is this massive filter , and as soon as you start going underwater , you 're going to lose your colors , and it 's going to get dark and blue very quickly .
but we 're humans — we 're terrestrial mammals .
and in this coral , it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass — could be this fluorescent protein .
so you would n't be making , like , 14 percent muscle and not using it , so it 's likely doing something that has a functional role .
and in total — we just reported this last year — we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish .
now , i wish i could have shown painlevé the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying .
`` ( laughter ) and i was like , `` '' maybe i should go back to corals . '' '' ( laughter ) it turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent . ''
but this is all beautiful to see .
it 's creating contrast that they can indeed see .
swimming at night , i encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle .
so now it 's going from fish and sharks into reptiles , which , again , this is only one month old , but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle 's vision .
`` as i try to get deeper , this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit — some people call this my `` '' jacques cousteau meets woody allen '' '' moment . ''
thank you .
one is about a problem of generalization , and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning .
we poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections .
yg : arthur , let me try again , okay ?
ls : let me try , clara .
i think these are all important stories , and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human , but i want you to note that today i told you a very different story .
whatever .
so then you realize there are these conventions .
`` he had to come in like a truck , a semi , with this thing . '' '' and then someone built this — this is the smith tower in seattle . ''
then you notice that if that lego-provided cad program is n't enough , there 's an entire open-source , third-party , independent lego cad program that lets you do 3d modeling and 3d rendering and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content — just beautiful — and people recreating all sorts of things .
anyway , i 'm out of time .
( laughter ) let 's see here .
and no , i 'm not a meter maid , and i 'm not an undertaker .
i am a gay talking head on fox news .
and that 's just on air .
you 'd totally be surprised .
or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
he spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates , and i know that if i ever had a problem , he would do anything he could to help .
because you ca n't get anyone to agree with you if they do n't even listen to you first .
it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it 's really powerful .
i 'm not saying it 's easy .
`` and one of my all-time favorites begins , `` '' i am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic , but i 'm a big fan of you as a person . '' '' now this guy does n't agree with me , yet . ''
but my subject is national security .
we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy .
and the cost annually is three trillion dollars .
so where do we go from here ?
the slide you 're looking at here is 1990 to 2040 .
if you take the last 10 years and bring forward , you 've transferred to opec a trillion dollars .
so where are we headed from here ?
natural gas will do everything we want it to do .
it 's going to be very simple for us to use .
do we have enough natural gas ?
go forward and the estimates that you have from the eia and onto the industry estimates — the industry knows what they 're talking about — we 've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that 's available to us .
there are eight million of them .
and so the margin is natural gas .
`` tbp : well i 'm not ready to give up , but jim and i talked there as he left , and i said , `` '' how do you feel about natural gas ? '' '' and he said , `` '' well it 's a bridge fuel , is what it is . '' '' and i said , `` '' bridge to what ? ''
you 've made the money you need .
you 're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate .
you ca n't — okay .
ca : one of the questions from the audience is , with fracking and the natural gas process , what about the problem of methane leaking from that , methane being a worse global warming gas than co2 ?
i saw my first one in '53 .
i do n't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania .
that is , it 's going to be a small part , because you ca n't rely on it .
ca : so how does the world get off fossil fuels ?
why ? air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel .
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution , are you ready to invest in those technologies , even if they are n't maximized for profits , they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
`` if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , `` '' help ! i 'm on fire ! '' '' — this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but i like to think that way . whichever works for you . ''
this is a tree .
tree .
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
`` if someone walks behind , that is `` '' to follow . '' '' as the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd . ''
three trees together , we create the forest .
three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
this person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . it 's a volcano .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
the hypothesis was actually it was your constitution that made you susceptible .
thankfully , since the 1950s , we 've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis .
but a lot of what was true in the early 1900s about infectious disease , we can say now about psychiatric disorders .
and also , like tuberculosis in the 1950s , we do n't know what causes it .
so iproniazid and imipramine , they 're more than just a case study in repurposing .
and it was this flexibility in our thinking that let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine could be repurposed in this way , which led us to the serotonin hypothesis , which we then , ironically , fixated on .
in the past few years , doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the ssris , calypsol , and this drug works very quickly , within a few hours or a day , and it does n't work on serotonin .
so in 2013 , up at columbia university , i was working with my colleague , dr. christine ann denny , and we were studying calypsol as an antidepressant in mice .
and it looked kind of like this .
and a normal mouse will explore .
and then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in france run it .
it 's the absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders .
and in depression and ptsd — here we have your stress exposure — we only have palliative care .
antidepressants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
the writer george eliot cautioned us that , among all forms of mistake , prophesy is the most gratuitous .
our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves , which means we 're going to need fewer truck drivers .
which brings up a critical question : why is this time different , if it really is ?
the first is , technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we 're on where output goes up over time , while at the same time , prices go down , and volume and quality just continue to explode .
now , some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism , but that 's absolutely the wrong way to look at it .
`` now , when i talk about this with my friends in cambridge and silicon valley , they say , `` '' fantastic . no more drudgery , no more toil . ''
this is just a plain statement of the facts .
the first are economic , and they 're really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth between henry ford ii and walter reuther , who was the head of the auto workers union .
if we look at the returns to labor , in other words total wages paid out in the economy , we see them at an all-time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction .
but as the social researcher charles murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot .
so i can not tell a happy story about these social trends , and they do n't show any signs of reversing themselves .
now , that 's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable , because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth .
i do n't know what the playbook is for getting bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life .
i do know that education is a huge part of it .
i was a montessori kid for the first few years of my education , and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it .
so the green shoots are out there .
i think we 're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason : the facts are getting out there .
( applause )
`` i have to go to school , get a job , send my kids to lessons ... `` '' you think , `` '' i 'm too busy . i do n't have time for art . '' '' there are hundreds of reasons why we ca n't be artists right now . ''
we are all born artists .
if you have kids , you know what i mean .
they draw with crayons on the wall .
so they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone .
`` for example , a kid says , `` '' mom , guess what ? i met an alien on my way home . '' '' then a typical mom responds , `` '' stop that nonsense . '' '' now , an ideal parent is someone who responds like this : `` '' really ? an alien , huh ? what did it look like ? did it say anything ? ''
in that moment , art makes you happy because it 's not work .
`` `` work is against human nature . the proof is that it makes us tired . '' ''
why ? because it 's tiring and we feel fatigue .
they do n't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
of course , there were kids who had to .
you know this gentleman , right ?
if you 're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall , you 'll surely get in trouble with your mom .
`` he stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it `` '' bull 's head . '' '' sounds convincing , right ? ''
that was duchamp .
yes , it means i did n't have to draw gyeonghoeru .
people who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the internet all night long .
that 's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side .
they dance , they act — and the more they do , they are praised .
they only get to think for the first five minutes .
`` this devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you ca n't write : `` '' people will laugh at you . this is not good writing ! ''
`` what kind of sentence is this ? look at your handwriting ! '' '' it will say a lot of things . ''
`` the magic question is , `` '' what for ? '' '' but art is not for anything . ''
secretly or publicly performing their own arts .
thank you .
( applause )
his name was yared .
now , i love this story because it 's true at multiple levels .
so let 's go now to the uniquely human world of language .
and controversial though it was , and even controversial though it remains , cage 's point is that there is no such thing as true silence .
the world is alive with musical expression .
he was saying that on its own , the environment is musically generative , that it is generous , that it is fertile , that we are already immersed .
and if that 's true , it means that we 're hard-wired for music , that we can find it anywhere , that there is no such thing as a musical desert , that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis , and that is marvelous .
in 2011 , during the final six months of kim jong-il 's life , i lived undercover in north korea .
every citizen wears the badge of the great leader at all times .
facebook , twitter — none of those things would have meant a thing .
and i could not tell them .
i had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students , because they lie so often and so easily , whether about the mythical accomplishments of their great leader , or the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders .
the difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them .
or , at moments , they lied out of habit .
but that turned out to be nearly impossible .
and i came to adore them .
i wanted so much to tell them the truth , of their country and of the outside world , where arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out , using the power of social media , where everyone except them was connected through the world wide web , which was n't worldwide after all .
the only wish you expressed , the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together , was for me to speak to you in korean .
i was there to teach you english ; you knew it was n't allowed .
the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean spring , but i do n't want you to do anything risky , because i know in your world , someone is always watching .
become soldiers of your great leader , and live long , safe lives .
but i know why you asked .
i know that it was important for you to hear that i , your teacher , the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from , declare your city as the most beautiful .
and i hope instead that you , my lovely young gentlemen , will one day help make it beautiful .
instead , we must offer them a tool that 's at least as powerful and as effective as violence .
nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect .
and protest is only one .
`` people were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message : `` '' renuncia ya '' '' — resign already . ''
to their surprise , 30,000 people showed up .
yet this is how most of the world 's nonviolent movements operate .
nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare , if not more .
they told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed .
it may be difficult to imagine defeating isis with action that is nonviolent .
thank you .
in fact , there 's over 1,000 pairs on ebay right now , four years later .
i have about 250 pairs , but trust me , i am small-time .
in the case of sneakers , that someone is nike .
but what really threatens humanity ?
we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
why is that ?
so let 's take a look at the flu virus .
in this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
now let 's take a look at hiv .
as variable as flu is , hiv makes flu look like the rock of gibraltar .
these drugs are n't cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv , at least for those who can access them .
it 's called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
vaccines were promised to developing countries .
well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce them , in the early 1940s .
for most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
so today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
so right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
luckily , this year 's flu was relatively mild .
so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology , and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
you also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
( laughter ) i actually find them a lot more emotional — ( laughter ) — and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike powerpoint and some other programs .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what i 'm talking about .
and of course , that was n't the case .
`` `` do n't mistake legibility for communication . '' ''
this is working with marshall mcluhan .
and also , surprisingly , it was done in kind of a cheap metal , and it had completely rusted through , and water everywhere , and spiders .
but anyway , i used this for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd , and i 've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape , and it 's ready . i think i 'm ready . so .
`` it says , `` '' if the cigarette companies can lie , then so can we . '' '' but — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — but i did . ''
this was either an old product with new packaging , or a brand-new package , and i just thought , yikes ! how 's that still happening ?
but anyway , this is one of the ads i was most pleased with , because they were all elaborately art-directed , and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .
`` it says , `` '' wonder around . '' '' and then it 's a piece of the software . ''
and this is how the ad ran around the world .
he 's just really hoping that boots up and , you know ...
there 's no grid , there 's no system , there 's nothing set up in advance .
`` there 's a lot of great writing in `` '' ray gun . '' '' and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books . ''
i suppose you could eventually decode it , but it 's really not very well written ; it really would n't be worthwhile .
and this continued through the entire magazine .
one — who knows what she 's going through ; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk .
as we get more technically driven , the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before .
before i tell that story , we should ask ourselves the question : why does poverty exist ?
i mean , there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs .
and i think — so i want to throw a perspective that i have , so that we can assess this project , or any other project , for that matter , to see whether it 's contributing or — contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it .
and in the end , there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens , and democracies , capitalism — everything else flourished .
and so you can see , the real process of — and this is backed up by this 500-page book — that the authorities came down and citizens got up .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
the authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business .
so naturally , i — the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty .
so if you lose that precious resource , where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries , that 's a huge waste .
so if you spend 2,000 dollars , and let 's say the telephone lasts 10 years , and if 5,000 dollars every year — so that 's 50,000 dollars .
so the point is that we could only — the only way we could depend on each other , is if we can connect with each other .
there were a lot of reasons people told me why we do n't have enough telephones .
but the point is , if it 's a production tool , why do we have to worry about that ?
the work pays them a salary ; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time .
they had telephone lines , so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea , like the internet .
and this is a business for her , but it 's milk for everybody else .
because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank , get a phone and have the phone for everybody .
`` if you think it can be done , come and make it happen . '' '' so i quit my job ; i went back to bangladesh . ''
`` i created a company in america called gonofone , which in bengali means `` '' people 's phone . '' '' and angel investors in america put in money into that . ''
and it 's serving 52,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
and of course , it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways .
and 2004 , the net profit , after taxes — very serious taxes — was 120 million dollars .
and the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers .
poor people are a resource .
and i think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today .
and if the lighting is n't too extreme — ah , ah ! there it is . it 's picked up the object off the conveyor .
he did n't have to select that from a menu .
they go to factories around the country .
now she 's got the robot doing it .
and as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
and i think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution .
so i 'm going to show you what i found over the last year .
this is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva , and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them .
then , their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae .
this is one of those alternatives .
this is what it takes to breed bees in a lab .
instead , i 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world .
and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves .
but the thing about self-expression is that there 's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen .
and as that 's happened , people have been leaving behind footprints , footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression .
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
the cloudy ones float along as if they 're on a breeze .
the rainy ones fall down as if they 're in a rainstorm , and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground .
finally , location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings .
metrics provides more numerical views on the data .
`` we see that the world is feeling `` '' used '' '' at 3.3 times the normal level right now . ''
it 's a bit different from the others .
and if i hold down my cursor , they do a little dance .
`` `` i feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life . '' ''
another technique is directly questioning people .
what makes you sad ? what do you believe in ? and so on .
but , you know , as i looked at this more and more and more , and saw these images go across the rocks , i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again .
you know : weddings , births , funerals , the first car , the first kiss , the first camel or horse — depending on the culture .
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky .
we see here there 's a little man walking along , or maybe a woman .
so , we 'll click ford , and now that becomes the center .
we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband 's coffin .
so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama .
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday , but he was back to work on sunday morning , and actually been tapering off since then this week .
and it 's not limited to just people or dates , but we can actually put in concepts also .
so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 , we 'll see what that universe looks like .
and there are also quotes that you can see , if you 're interested in reading about quotes on climate change .
the superstars of climate change in 2006 : united states , britain , china . you know , these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept .
so this is a piece that demands exploration .
this will be online in several days , probably next tuesday .
so it 's been a pleasure . thank you very much .
`` and my mother came up and said , `` '' what on earth are you doing ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm going to budapest . '' '' and she said , `` '' what on earth for ? '' '' and i said , `` '' kids are getting killed there . ''
`` there 's something terrible happening . '' '' and she said , `` '' do n't be so silly . '' '' and i started to cry . ''
`` but just unpack your suitcase . '' '' and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s . ''
they came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns .
so what about our fear ?
the only thing to do is to get up , make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you .
it 's bottom-up or grassroots power .
and peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do .
and the kind of thing they 're doing is demobilizing militias , rebuilding economies , resettling refugees , even liberating child soldiers .
and it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere , because it works and it 's effective .
because finally human beings are getting it .
and we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve .
probably not , but people like me do .
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human dna from ancient bones .
and from these extracts , we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations , risk factors and inherited diseases .
there are no slides , so you 'll just have to be content with me .
and sometimes i 'm puzzled , and i ask myself why .
this is the africa that is changing , that chris alluded to .
due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president — as in many countries — have immunity and can not be prosecuted . but what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .
there 's still a long way to go , but that there 's a will there .
so when you hear about corruption , do n't just feel that nothing is being done about this — that you ca n't operate in any african country because of the overwhelming corruption . that is not the case .
there 's a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . in others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go .
that is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa .
so when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe — where the money 's going and what can be done to stop it .
because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .
and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , nigeria .
( laughter ) having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
you had to do everything to get your phone .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
but there 's a huge market out there , and people do n't know about it , or they do n't want to know .
we did n't know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
so , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . financial services : we had 89 banks . too many not doing their real business .
so what am i trying to say ? i 'm trying to tell you that there 's a new wave on the continent .
but i 'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever .
thank you very much .
across europe and central asia , approximately one million children live in large residential institutions , usually known as orphanages .
it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children .
having worked with lots of young children , i expected the institution to be a riot of noise , but it was as silent as a convent .
across all of these diverse lands and cultures , the institutions , and the child 's journey through them , is depressingly similar .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
awareness-raising is required at every level of society .
so this is james risen .
( applause )
it 's a project by the long now foundation , which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand .
well , let 's take science .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
bill gates , fortunately , has bet a billion on [ agricultural ] research .
they 've overtaken the u.s. as the world 's biggest car market , they 've overtaken germany as the largest exporter , and they 've started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers .
( applause )
six thousand miles of road , 600 miles of subway track , 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track , if you 've ever been to roosevelt island .
the mta will boast how many miles of subway track there are .
pretty interesting , right ?
but did you ever think about where these numbers came from ?
the problem is , how do they know all of our questions ?
in fact , in some ways there 's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city .
in the last two years , the city has released 1,000 datasets on our open data portal , and it 's pretty awesome .
so i had a question .
when 's rush hour in new york city ?
it can be pretty bothersome . when is rush hour exactly ?
makes sense . and this is important for a couple of reasons .
now , chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public , and so it ended up online for all to use , and that 's where this graph came from .
and not just our crime data , our own city budget .
these are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets .
it 's amazing . and a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog .
what does a working mother look like ?
i got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images , which look nothing like my life , that i recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that i hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby 's food source is attached to your body .
and yet , for many new working mothers , this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies .
i wanted to make a point .
i 'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today .
( laughter ) like , what is she doing ?
there 's nothing to see here .
the first choice says that women have chosen to work .
we need women to work . we need working women to have babies .
`` a waitress told me , `` '' with my first baby , i was back at work five weeks postpartum . ''
`` i had third degree tears . '' '' 23 percent of new working mothers in america will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth . ''
`` one of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby . '' '' of course , this is n't just a scenario with economic and physical implications . ''
`` a woman told me , `` '' i went back at eight weeks after my c-section because my husband was out of work . ''
remember that 88 percent ?
when we talk about expanding our family now , we focus on how much time i would have to care for myself and a new baby .
we need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us .
because this is not , this is not , and this is not what a working mother looks like .
when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley , i had some misgivings .
hollywood has its sex symbols , and the valley has its sex symbols .
so it turned out there was a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .
( laughter ) so i figured i needed to learn a little bit more about business , so i went to stanford business school and studied there .
i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers , to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .
and there really was n't a specific company that was focused on the public interest .
and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change .
and we had an online component of that , our community sect called participate.net .
and that to me , spoke volumes , because it 's — the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed , sued her employer , led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act , and the violence against women act and others .
at that point , i thought i knew something about global warming .
( laughter ) and for participant , this is just the start .
`` and we 're also doing a movie called `` '' the kite runner , '' '' based on the book `` '' the kite runner , '' '' also about afghanistan . ''
that was perfectly okay 200 million years ago .
the environment changed very slowly .
now that went along fine , but then something happened .
the amount of data we 're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year .
i 've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital a , and that 's all they care about .
`` ordinarily you would n't think so , but we 're expecting an e , it 's good enough , and yeah , i 've seen an e , and then apple says , `` yeah , i 've seen an apple . '' ''
there was a 16-year-old girl , she had brain surgery , and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her .
well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex .
and our thinking , then , will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking , but the non-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns .
but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different .
and my answer must at once be , it is no use .
there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . so it is no use .
mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that 's certainly the case .
scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole .
i 'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . you 'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed .
this is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades , and it was not a natural disaster — it was a disaster of engineering .
there is nothing here that we do n't know .
if you look at this building in chile , it 's ripped in half , but it 's not a pile of rubble .
chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades .
( applause )
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony .
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters .
`` so he 's saying , `` '' i 've got this problem . '' '' he 's saying , `` '' here 's your solution . thanks very much . next . '' '' that 's the way we talk , right guys ? ''
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent — roughly one in six — of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
the voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? get trained ; learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
you can do this in groups as well .
it 's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
so i 'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
the violin , which meant everything to me , became a grave burden on me .
i think , while i 'm enjoying my life as a happy musician , i 'm earning a lot more recognition than i 've ever imagined .
but it 's now your turn .
and so we 've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick .
but it was n't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
so this is my grandfather . i actually never met him , but he 's holding my mom , and his genes are in me , right ?
and that was n't the goal . it was n't the point . right ?
and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail . and this is personal to me .
`` so i started putting this in my slide decks , and i got even more obnoxious , and i went to my doctor , and i said , `` '' i 'd like to actually get my bloodwork . ''
we do it voluntarily , and we do it through standardized legal tools . we do it through standardized technologies .
so vanderbilt ran a study asking people , we 'd like to take your biosamples , your blood , and share them in a biobank , and only five percent of the people opted out .
those are strengths in the system .
and so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we 've created , so you can actually come in , all you have to be is 14 years old , willing to sign a contract that says i 'm not going to be a jerk , basically , and you 're in .
so what i 'd end [ with ] is , the most beautiful thing i 've learned since i quit my job almost a year ago to do this , is that it really does n't take very many of us to achieve spectacular results .
but to be naked in a group , voluntarily , can be quite beautiful .
this one has a little cave in his chest .
that 's a body getting split in half .
and so through this piano keyboard , we have the means to take a musical process and study it .
audience : the same.eddie obeng : the same .
no , they 're not the same . ( laughter ) they 're not the same . the top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one .
you remember ? and you learned the answer , and you 've carried this answer in your head for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years : the answer is the same . the answer is the same . so when you 're asked what the lengths are , you say they 're the same , but they 're not the same , because i 've changed it .
somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works .
when i 'm joking , i try and explain it happened at midnight , you see , while we were asleep , but it was midnight 15 years ago . okay ?
you did n't notice it ? but basically , what they do is , they switched all the rules round , so that the way to successfully run a business , an organization , or even a country , has been deleted , flipped , and it 's a completely new — you think i 'm joking , do n't you — there 's a completely new set of rules in operation . ( laughter ) did you notice that ? i mean , you missed this one .
`` if you go on google and you look for `` '' innovation + creativity , '' '' you get 30 million hits . if you add the word `` '' consultants , '' '' it doubles to 60 million . ( laughter ) are you with me ? and yet , statistically , what you discover is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception . ''
we 've spent decades professionalizing implementation .
what actually happens is , if i compare this to the average real project , average real successful project , the family actually end up in makassar , south sulawesi , at a cost of 4,000 pounds , whilst leaving two of the children behind . ( laughter ) what i 'm trying to explain to you is , there are things which do n't make sense to us .
the density of the interaction of human beings is amazing .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
i mean , this is not exciting stuff . are you with me ?
yes , learn , but i know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers , because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle , and you believe it will last forever .
one , you 're doing something that you should follow a procedure to , and it 's a very difficult thing , you 're sloppy , you get it wrong . how should you be treated ? you should probably be fired .
now do n't get me wrong , writing has certain advantages .
when you write , because it 's a conscious process , because you can look backwards , you can do things with language that are much less likely if you 're just talking .
now of course , as history has gone by , it 's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing .
for two hours before that , edward everett spoke on a topic that , frankly , can not engage us today and barely did then .
well , if you can speak like writing , then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak .
what texting is , despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing , is fingered speech . that 's what texting is .
and in order to understand it , what we want to see is the way , in this new kind of language , there is new structure coming up .
but if you text now , or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it 's become , you 'll notice that lol does not mean laughing out loud anymore .
`` if you listen to the way black youth today speak , think about the use of the word `` '' yo . '' '' whole dissertations could be written about it , and probably are being written about it . ''
a pragmatic particle , that 's what lol has gradually become .
it 's used to change the scene .
you do n't just zip right into it .
you ca n't do that while you 're texting , and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium .
`` so , `` '' from every college in the country goes up the cry , 'our freshmen ca n't spell , ca n't punctuate . ' '' '' and so on . you can go even further back than this . ''
`` `` '' bad spelling , incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing . '' '' and he 's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies . ''
or you can go all the way back to 63 a.d. — ( laughter ) — and there 's this poor man who does n't like the way people are speaking latin .
that 's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing .
`` take that person from 1993 — not that long ago , this is `` '' bill and ted 's excellent adventure '' '' — those people . ''
whole arm . shoulder disarticulation .
`` and they deserve more than that . '' '' and literally , this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said , `` '' i want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that 'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table , they 'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one , and they 'll be able to know the difference without looking at it . '' '' you know , had efferent , afferent , and haptic response . ''
`` that 's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . '' '' i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let 's supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i do n't need another mission . ''
`` i went down to washington . i saw these guys , and said , `` '' i did what you asked me . i looked at what 's out there . ''
it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
( applause )
for some reason , there 's no standard syllabus , there 's no basic course .
you can just type over it .
tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator .
now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there 's something about honeybees that draws people into their world .
so seven years ago , when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse , first in the united states , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong .
so what 's going on ?
and then there 's pesticides .
this small bee is holding up a large mirror .
one of these class of insecticides , the neonicontinoids , is making headlines around the world right now .
every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways .
campaign to have them planted in public gardens , community spaces , meadows .
family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead , allowing them to inherit their father 's share of the ancestral farmland .
he was laid to rest in the ganges river , where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water .
and i found these maps which you see here .
but sometimes when his female patients ca n't afford his services , their families give the women to jura in exchange for medical treatment .
in his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here .
two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them , three for evil spirits , one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives ondijo claims he took for love , paying their families a total of 16 cows .
and in this particular chapter , it 's children whose mothers would n't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it .
during the course of this trial , all of the rabbits died , except for a few , which were euthanized .
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
`` they are leonardo da vinci 's `` '' lady with an ermine , '' '' rembrandt 's `` '' landscape with good samaritan '' '' and raphael 's `` '' portrait of a youth , '' '' which has never been found . ''
installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of louis novaes , who 's the head of the novaes family , are these turret holes , which were used for shooting and looking .
this piece is ordered by age because it ca n't be ordered by blood .
children have to leave the orphanage at age 16 , despite the fact that there 's often nowhere for them to go .
and the director listed the orphanage 's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer , four vacuum cleaners , two computers , a video projector , a copy machine , winter shoes and a dentist 's drill .
and there 's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between .
acting against the interest of their company .
at the beginning , i thought there was a chicken and egg issue : because people are less engaged , they are less productive .
the soft — feelings , sentiments , interpersonal relationships , traits , personality .
and every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
we create dedicated structure processed systems , basically to deal with the new complexity of business .
the hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization .
so , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
if repairability is the new requirement , the solution is to create a new function , mr. repairability .
with a repairability scorecard , with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive .
what difference did it make in their actions , their choices to simplify ? zero .
when we do n't cooperate we need more time , more equipment , more systems , more teams .
improve interpersonal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
it is even counterproductive .
me , designer , if i put a wire here , i know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights .
by removing layers .
and we end up with the encyclopedia britannica of rules .
these rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
you can increase the shadow of the future .
when you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , i hold you by the ear .
it has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use .
`` i would give the boy probably about 30 seconds , which means , by the time he got to me , i was already saying things like , `` '' why are you crying ? ''
just go on , go on in your room .
`` and as i grow in life , i would say to myself , `` '' my god , what 's wrong with me ? ''
and this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his teenage son in the ground — something i just ca n't even imagine .
and this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
`` he looks out his window ; he calls me upstairs ; he said , `` '' hey anthony . '' '' they called me anthony growing up as a kid . ''
so i run right upstairs .
( laughter ) the other thing i could n't tell him is that i did n't want any .
anyway , so i could n't tell him any of that .
i go in his room . on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila .
anyway , johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office .
how , maybe , is it possible to use the internet to create a new form of cinema ?
we published all those films for free on the internet , and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way .
how could the use of new technologies and the road fit together ?
so i went on five-year travels around the globe .
this is important to record that whole person .
it may be a way to maintain a certain diversity .
from the tana toraja funeral ritual in indonesia to an easter ceremony in the north of ethiopia .
it 's research on the new spiritualities all around the country .
this is my quest , my own little quest of what i call experimental ethnography , trying to hybrid all those different genres , trying to regain a certain complexity .
the way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world , and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible , terrible job at representing the world : violence , extremists , only spectacular events , only simplifications of everyday life .
the respect is stepping forward , not stepping backward , and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment , in the ceremony , in the places , people welcome you and understand your energy .
i mean , you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length , etc .
otherwise , you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning , and so is that the case ?
( applause ) ( music ) naná vasconcelos : let 's go to the jungle . ( applause )
`` by lying with him keep alive for yourselves . ' '' '' in other words , kill the men ; kill the children ; if you see any virgins , then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them . ''
according to non-governmental organizations that keep such statistics , since 1945 , in europe and the americas , there has been a steep decline in interstate wars , in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms , and in military coups , even in south america . worldwide , there 's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars . the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present .
one of them is we have better reporting . the associated press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the earth than sixteenth-century monks were .
things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age . there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets : no one ever attracted observers , advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better .
( laughter ) there 's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life , and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture .
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink , rather than how high our standards have risen .
the only thing is that it 's liable to having its bluff called , and therefore can only work if it 's credible . to make it credible , you must avenge all insults and settle all scores , which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta .
( applause ) .
chris anderson : i loved that talk . i think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of — that you were talking about , that peter singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology , by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller . i mean , is that also a grain of truth ?
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .
shabbir and nawroz were never seen again .
they were screaming .
it was like a scene from doomsday , or maybe like one of those scenes from those hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending .
it was happening to us for real .
when my documentary was aired on sbs dateline , many of my friends came to know about my situation , and they tried to help me .
you know , we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs , a one-hit image . these were big , complex things , almost like cartoons with multiple narratives .
but in reality , in the course of the coming weeks and months , hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show .
the exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
`` we live in an age of ubiquitous information , and sort of `` '' just add water '' '' expertise , but there 's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative , what the curator does , the interpretation of a complex , esoteric subject , in a way that retains the integrity of the subject , that makes it — unpacks it for a general audience . ''
and we proceeded to do something at the museum , i think , we 've never done before .
`` i heard over and over again , `` '' wow , that was worth it . ''
i think for most americans , knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of america 's darkest hours , and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event .
the newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit .
the pan-african opportunities outweigh the challenges , and that 's why we 're expanding stawi 's markets from just kenya to algeria , nigeria , ghana , and anywhere else that will buy our food .
here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
and each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain .
one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
today i 'll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
if i reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object .
these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
but the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being touched .
so , it 's empathizing the other person being touched .
and there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
so , you have a patient with a phantom limb . if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom .
now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person 's hand , massage the other person 's hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged .
that really , the mixing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
`` and when people tell me , `` '' who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? '' '' i say to myself , `` '' what planet do you come from ? '' '' okay , there 's not a person in this room — i do n't care how techie you are — there 's not a person in this room that does n't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ? ''
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank . it 's different .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that 's roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it 'll become commonplace .
and the reason i think design matters is n't because i wanted to go to art school .
`` and , in english , the word `` '' cheap '' '' has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it 's cheap , in the pejorative sense , as well as inexpensive . ''
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously did n't compare notes .
if you 're in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
if you 're in the jungle , it 's about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they 're going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they 're not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you do n't call verizon or sprint . you build your own network .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it 's rich .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent .
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
launched it on the 12 of november .
get your friends to give one , get one .
they went to uruguay , peru , mexico .
thank you .
i seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city , studio to studio , interview to interview , serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks .
or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we have n't had the time , or the patience , or the tranquility , to be with the other person , to listen to them .
`` and one of them made reference to a series of books called `` the one-minute bedtime story . '' ''
`` my first reflex was to say , `` '' hallelujah — what a great idea ! ''
i just thought , and i thought long and hard .
now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
whereas in the west , time is linear .
we try and do more and more with less and less time .
they eat better ; they make love better ; they exercise better ; they work better ; they live better .
i think also the explosion of the organic farming movement , and the renaissance of farmers ' markets , are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable .
it 's not just , though , these days , adults who overwork , though , is it ? it 's children , too .
i mean , you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness , and that 's true , but that 's not all of it .
that 's really the main question before us today . is it possible to slow down ? and i 'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes .
i play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and i would n't give them up for the world .
my default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic .
i no longer hear time 's winged chariot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
i feel like i 'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it .
he 'd gone and stapled two cards , very like these , together , and put a sticker of his favorite character , tintin , on the front .
`` is that a good luck on the book tour card ? '' '' and he said , `` '' no , no , no , daddy — this is a card for being the best story reader in the world . '' '' and i thought , `` '' yeah , you know , this slowing down thing really does work . '' '' thank you very much . ''
and then there 's that cliché , the african dictator or minister or official .
so his daddy is president for life of equatorial guinea , a west african nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record .
and there 's dan etete .
our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in cambodia .
well , some of that sprang from our work .
well , when he was oil minister , he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that , guess what , yeah , he was the hidden owner of .
and will the people of congo , will they ever get their money back ?
there 's corruption everywhere , so why focus on that sector ?
now , on the surface , the deal appeared straightforward .
but literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency , and now it 's fast becoming the norm and the law .
thank you .
well , i can tell you that , in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system , also known as pressure cooker , not everyone can do well in that environment .
why bows ?
the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty , where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves .
as i fell deeper into bow making , i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood .
i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom , in the audience today : mom , i was really sorry , and i will be more careful with open fire from now on .
i also researched extensively on bows around the world .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
from this realization , i began to take interest in korean history , which had never inspired me before .
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
the bow resembles me , and i resemble the bow .
i 've also been going about the business of putting down roots , choosing a partner , making babies .
this is true of rich and poor , men and women .
it felt like a provocation .
by that singular measurement , we are failing .
median per capita income has been flat since about 2000 , adjusted for inflation .
less of us are doing that .
home-ownership rates are at their lowest since 1995 .
part of what i 've learned in my research and reporting is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable .
it confronts us with profound questions , questions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask in times of relative comfort .
we should work like our mothers .
`` my mom called it `` '' just making it work . '' '' today i hear life coaches call it `` '' a portfolio career . '' '' whatever you call it , more and more men are craving these whole , if not harried , lives . ''
is what we understand about the world .
whole industries are being born and dying every day .
we need to reinvent labor organizing .
but all the research proves otherwise .
but additionally , we share an industrial-sized kitchen and eating area , where we have common meals twice a week .
you share all the domestic labor — the repairing , the cooking , the weeding — but you also share the emotional labor .
maybe you 're a mediocre earner but a masterful father .
you might be a failure by standards you hold dear but that the world does n't reward .
there is no home big enough to erase the pain that she must have endured .
we can turn inward , lose faith in the power of institutions to change — even lose faith in ourselves .
i 'm a writer , and i 've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers , and i 've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah .
the truth is , everything we know about america , everything americans come to know about being american , is n't from the news .
i live there .
shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body .
the language actually makes the world in which we live .
we 've had a lot of — a parade of amazing ideas here .
`` and tom opens up his lunch box and there 's rice in it , and he goes on this rant about , `` '' twenty years , my wife has been packing rice for lunch . ''
and now the inquest — you know , tom 's wife and dick 's wife are distraught .
a lot of us are very privileged .
`` shut him up . '' '' and as idris moves , fraser screams , `` '' stop ! ''
i 'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves — how as a writer , i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent .
and this is the difficulty that i face .
i want to believe that we can be agnostic about this , that we can rise above all of this .
last night i heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet .
pressure can make everything whole again .
it 's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .
and so as we move out , we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies , as we see here , light-travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are .
as we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we 're essentially backing up into the past .
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .
coming in closer , picking up earth , orbit of the moon , and we see the earth .
thank you .
( applause )
one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven and brahms , bruckner , all the b 's , from bartók , all the way up to esa-pekka salonen .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
( applause ) robert gupta : i 'm going to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists .
it 's gone .
i always live in the present — i love the present .
that 's my camera lens . the first one — the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
`` by the way , that 's `` '' sputnik . '' '' i ran it last year . ''
idea about women .
that 's my father 's letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
that 's my daughter and me .
i used to be a photographer for many years .
in 1978 , i was working for time magazine , and i was given a three-day assignment to photograph amerasian children , children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia , and then abandoned — 40,000 children all over asia .
i decided i would find six children in different countries , and actually go spend some time with the kids , and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine .
the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors , so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor .
hyun-sook was 11 years old .
and what struck me immediately in meeting hyun-sook was how confident she appeared to be , how happy she seemed to be in her own skin .
and i noticed that she was clowning around .
and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator — again , this thing about saying stop — was to not pay attention to me .
and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator , the grandmother started crying .
`` and i said to my translator , `` '' what 's going on , why is she crying ? '' '' and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment , and then she started getting tears in her eyes . ''
`` why is everyone crying ? '' '' and the translator said , `` '' the grandmother says that she thinks she 's dying , and she wants to know if you would take hyun-sook to america with you . '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i 'm not married . '' '' i mean i had fallen in love with this girl , but i — you know , it was , like , emotionally i was about 12 years old . ''
`` and so , when i got outside , i actually gave the translator some money and said , `` please go back and see if you can do something . '' ''
and my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child .
because i had n't told them what i was doing , because i was so upset with the story they 'd run .
`` i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her . '' '' i said , `` '' but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i 'm stuck here for a week . '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm staying in a hotel downtown . ''
this is my niece , i love her , she 's my sister 's daughter .
this was now , i think , february , early february .
and the pictures before were taken in september .
hyun-sook stayed at father keene 's , and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .
this may be one of those myth-buster things that we 'll have to clear up here , in a minute .
and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map , where he lived .
now , i 'd been staying in this room for about three months — it was a little 15-story korean hotel .
we 're lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
i 'd been doing this every night i 'd been there .
`` so , sure enough , it 's one o'clock , room 's freezing , i go to close the window , and i hear people shouting outside , and i thought , `` '' oh , the bars must have just gotten out . '' '' and i do n't speak korean , but i 'm hearing these voices , and i 'm not hearing anger , i 'm hearing terror . ''
so , we try to get to the door , and we run to the door , and we open the door and it 's like walking into a blast furnace .
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
`` one was absolute terror — it 's like , `` '' oh , please god , i just want to wake up . ''
`` please , i just want to wake up , it 's got to be a nightmare . '' '' and the other is unbelievable guilt . ''
`` then he said , `` '' do you have gaffer 's tape ? '' '' i said , `` '' what ? '' '' he said , `` '' do you have gaffer 's tape ? '' '' i said , `` '' yeah , somewhere in my halliburton . '' '' he says , `` '' we 've got to stop the smoke . '' '' he said , `` '' that 's all we can do , we 've got to stop the smoke . '' '' i mean , gene — thank god for gene . ''
five people jumped and died , other people were killed by the smoke .
in any case , 12 hours later , i mean , they put us in the lobby .
so , these are the greenhouse tents .
this is her cooking teacher .
this is a tense moment in the first football game , i think .
the captain of the cheerleaders .
her future husband , jeff , was working for canon cameras , and met natasha at the olympic village .
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .
natasha : i 've seen pictures millions of times , but today was the first time i 'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .
well , commercial hunting happened .
the carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere .
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen .
there 's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
so there 's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon , genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon , and so on with the red eye , peach-colored breast , flocking , and so on .
add them all up and the result wo n't be perfect .
de-extinction falls in that category .
the aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle , and so basically its genome is alive , it 's just unevenly distributed .
cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is oliver ryder .
so now we go to mike mcgrew who is a scientist at roslin institute in scotland , and mike 's doing miracles with birds .
( laughter ) real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
the california condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 .
in 1981 , dian fossey was sure they were going extinct .
i think it 's time for the subject to go public .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you .
i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there 's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way .
when we think about prejudice and bias , we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things .
we 're very good at this sort of thing .
the chair could collapse if you sit on it , the apple might be poison , the dog might not bark , and in fact , this is my dog tessie , who does n't bark .
why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
he got involved in different pursuits .
and tajfel rejected this .
tajfel said what we see in the holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us .
we see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies .
`` ( laughter ) [ `` '' help ! mom ! there are liberals under my bed ! '' '' ] but in general , stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter , and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history . ''
people do n't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics .
i do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in america for moral change has been a situation comedy .
`` at some point in his wonderful book `` the better angels of our nature , '' steven pinker says , the old testament says love thy neighbor , and the new testament says love thy enemy , but i do n't love either one of them , not really , but i do n't want to kill them . ''
we have gut feelings , instincts , emotions , and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil , but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning , and we can use these to , in some cases , accelerate and nourish our emotions , and in other cases staunch them .
and it 's in this way that reason helps us create a better world .
so these are the kinds of stories of an africa ready to take responsibility for itself , and to look for solutions for its own problems .
many of the economies are still commodity driven , and therefore their performance has slipped .
in 2000 , we had 11 million phone lines .
and this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy .
so this was a very good development , something that went right .
there were many conflicts on the continent .
but what did we do wrong ?
let me mention eight things .
you have to have more things wrong than right .
so we created more billionaires .
we had investment from the chinese .
governance is a serious issue .
we need to partner with international partners , developed countries , to fight this together .
we must .
and above all , we have to engage our young people .
it 's a trend .
people have fought back , and your mother was kidnapped .
how have you been handling this ?
and even out of government , we continued to make that point .
in 2007 , i became the attorney general of the state of new jersey .
the first is that i asked what i thought were really basic questions .
i ran the camden police department because of that .
when i was an assistant d.a. , and when i was a federal prosecutor , i looked at the cases in front of me , and i generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience .
so i wanted to do things differently .
in short , i wanted to moneyball criminal justice .
almost seven in 10 people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration .
take leslie chew , who was a texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night .
he was arrested , and he was kept in jail on 3,500 dollars bail , an amount that he could not afford to pay .
i looked all over the country , and i found that between five and 10 percent of all u.s. jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool , and when i looked at these tools , i quickly realized why .
and so we built a universal risk assessment tool .
and that 's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them .
i call it moneyballing criminal justice .
thank you .
i woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
i do not remember what time it was .
i just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking .
i was that girl .
we only talk about one side of it .
`` it is very scary to go through that feeling of `` '' i am about to die '' '' or `` '' i could die in this explosion . '' '' but there 's also the fear of losing loved ones , and i think that 's even worse . ''
eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children . oh .
we are missing the story of nehia , a palestinian woman in gaza who , the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year 's war , she left out of home , collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have , in case there is no cease-fire the day after . we are missing
there is a side that is focused on winning battles , and there is a side that is focused on winning life .
and in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace , we must understand war and peace from both sides .
a congolese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they 're doing okay right now .
when the soul lies down in that grass , the world is too full to talk about .
we are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
without this ability there is no magic .
there are tales of creation and loss , death and resurrection , and obstacles that must be overcome .
magicians play with fire and steel , defy the fury of the buzzsaw , dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape .
the finale defies logic , gives new insight into the problem , and audiences express their amazement with laughter .
the tools of social networking , these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story .
we turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
now , why do i say this ?
and they offer hope for the rest of us .
but canada 's also important because of its triumph over a problem currently tearing many other countries apart : immigration .
its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than france 's , and its percentage of foreign-born residents is double that of sweden .
meanwhile , canada admitted 10 times more syrian refugees in the last year than did the united states .
`` and yet , if you ask canadians what makes them proudest of their country , they rank `` '' multiculturalism , '' '' a dirty word in most places , second , ahead of hockey . ''
hockey .
until the mid-1960s , canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy .
( applause ) the thing to know about that first trudeau is that he was very different from canada 's previous leaders .
he was even kind of groovy .
( laughter ) and like all hipsters , he could be infuriating at times .
with 250 million people , indonesia is the largest muslim-majority country on earth .
now , try to imagine congress doing it all at the same time .
`` as santiago creel , an opposition senator , put it to me , `` '' look , i 'm not saying that i 'm special or that anyone is special , but that group , that was special . '' '' the proof ? ''
so now we 've seen how these three countries overcame three of their great challenges .
you 've got to adapt them as circumstances change .
now , countries face crises all the time . right ?
but trudeau 's genius was to realize that canada 's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform .
beethoven is adored in japan .
peruvians love japanese woodblock prints .
beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
it did not evolve for natural survival .
it 's women who actually push history forward .
but , someone might argue , that 's natural beauty .
but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
this object was made by a hominid ancestor , homo erectus or homo ergaster , between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language .
for us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
no , it 's deep in our minds .
it 's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — ( frequency sounds ) — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head , and i hear the color in front of me through the bone , through bone conduction .
i started to have favorite colors , and i started to dream in colors .
this is my passport from 2004 .
it 's full of different melodies . ( laughter ) yeah .
instead of drawing someone 's face , like drawing the shape , i point at them with the eye and i write down the different notes i hear , and then i create sound portraits .
prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman .
so i connect the eye , and then i play the audience 's faces .
`` ( music ) it 's justin bieber 's `` '' baby . '' '' ( laughter ) ( music ) it is very pink and very yellow . ''
and i 'm going to demonstrate for you .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly .
so like , you ca n't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease , and inbreeding and incest and , let 's see , what 's the other one ?
all right .
all right .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs . on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high-agility movements .
there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
ab : i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
i mean , that 's 2005 figures .
but is it practical ?
they 're the other big generation .
this one is a little l-shaped strip shopping center in phoenix , arizona .
by 1980 , it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
this was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
they 're easy to be re-adapted .
but the one story stuff ...
but it 's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .
there 's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like flint , michigan .
and where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
and so we 've created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production .
they are new but trying to look old .
i want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places — more sustainable places , period .
and the reason he was , was that len is a cold fish .
so , that 's the second path .
only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women 's lives , how they would become role models for their own community , did some agree .
seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach , i asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images .
and here i would like to end with a quote by yasmine , one of the four activist women i interviewed in tunisia .
oh yeah .
no , no . front of the line .
my next surgeon 's appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
moments later , i had a surgery date just weeks away , and a big fat prescription for percocet .
where does choice come from ?
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?
the market reforms prompted by the west — and i 've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets , and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent , hundreds of traders — trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform .
and we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 .
well , i 'm not here today to lament about the situation , or wring my hands .
i did so for a simple reason .
so that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center — what we call the remote access terminal centers — and actually , without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things , simply see the trading that 's happening on the addis ababa trading floor .
so all of this will transform farmers .
it will also transform the way traders do business .
ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
so the potential is there .
the commitment is there .
so , when i was in art school , i developed a shake in my hand , and this was the straightest line i could draw .
the shake developed out of , really , a single-minded pursuit of pointillism , just years of making tiny , tiny dots .
i just had to find a different approach to making the art that i wanted .
now , i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism , seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole .
at the time , i was finishing up school , and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies .
and i realized , if i ever wanted my creativity back , i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it .
i wondered , could you become more creative , then , by looking for limitations ?
what if i could only create with a dollar 's worth of supplies ?
i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas , and wondered what if , instead of painting on a canvas , i could only paint on my chest ?
in the beginning of goodbye art , i focused on forced destruction , like this image of jimi hendrix , made with over 7,000 matches .
and in return , i found a process of creating art that 's perpetual and unencumbered by results .
when i think back to my three years away from art , away from my dream , just going through the motions , instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream , i just quit , i gave up .
now , when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped , i sometimes still struggle , but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities , like using hundreds of real , live worms to make an image , using a pushpin to tattoo a banana , or painting a picture with hamburger grease .
limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity , but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts , rethink categories and challenge accepted norms .
thank you .
`` i follow these young people for years at a time , across institutional settings , to try to understand what some of us call the `` '' school-to-prison pipeline . '' '' when you look at a picture like this , of young people who are in my study ... ''
but i see it different .
i know this because i am one of them .
he bleeds to death on the street .
this teacher , ms. russ ...
she was the kind of teacher that was always in your business .
four in the morning on a school day , we 'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van , and the bottles would break .
`` i applied with the mentors and support she provided , got a letter of acceptance , and one of the paragraphs read , `` you 've been admitted under probationary status . '' ''
let 's help them be proud of who they are , because our education system welcomes their families , their cultures , their communities and the skill set they 've learned to survive .
he had dropped out , he was a gang member , a criminal .
`` he slammed his hands on the desk and he said , `` hey , everybody ! group hug ! group hug ! '' ''
( applause ) this young lady 's tears and pain turned into joy and laughter knowing that her community had her back , and william had now learned that he did have a purpose in life : to help to heal the souls of people in his own community .
the folks who know , of course , run our largest banks , and in the last go-around , they cost us over 11 trillion dollars .
and cost us over 10 million jobs as well .
and the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud .
control fraud is what happens when the people who control , typically a ceo , a seemingly legitimate entity , use it as a weapon to defraud .
and three , farther down the road , the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out .
start with the industry .
the industry responded between 2003 and 2006 by increasing liar 's loans by over 500 percent .
and this is despite a warning from the industry 's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraudsters , and that they had a fraud incidence of 90 percent , nine zero .
it had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud , in which , guess what , its members are always the victim and never the perpetrators .
and the fbi has bought this hook , line , sinker , rod , reel and the boat they rode out in .
and it 's those oh-so-clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor , pitiful banks , who lack any financial sophistication .
we need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises .
and i started having these bizarre dinner parties at my house on friday nights where people would come over and we would do dna extractions , and i would actually capture them on video , because it created this kind of funny portrait as well .
( laughter ) these are people who do n't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever .
we 're in the first edition of 100 pieces , hoping to do another edition pretty soon .
i thought it might be interesting , even for the many long-time collectors here with us at ted , local collectors , to have an outside view of 10 young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know .
the first is bharti kher .
our next artist , balasubramaniam , really stands at the crossroads of sculpture , painting and installation , working wonders with fiberglass .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
he really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban bombay .
mumbai-based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women .
raqib shaw is kolkata-born , kashmir-raised , and london-trained .
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art , subodh gupta .
these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye .
right ? that 's how the mirror neuron system works .
well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes .
( laughter ) because my father himself , and my three uncles , in world war ii , were all conscientious objectors , all pussycats .
( laughter ) and we had to take action . now our kids found out about it .
it begins with a clean sheet of paper , a felt marker , and without using any words , you begin to draw how to make toast .
they really suck , actually , because you do n't know what they 're trying to say .
so you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes , and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes .
now , though this might seem trivial , it 's actually really important .
so this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes .
what 's really important to know is that it 's the conversations that are the important aspects , not just the models themselves .
so , one example is from an organization called rodale .
make your ideas visible , tangible , and consequential .
it 's simple , it 's fun , it 's powerful , and i believe it 's an idea worth celebrating .
thank you .
so the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material .
( applause ) and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
but silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
so for instance , if you 're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle , we do microneedle arrays .
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that 's made of silk — just to give you a sense of size .
so you think of alternative mechanical parts .
which means that all the devices that you 've seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear .
and reintegration in the human body is not the only thing , but reintegration in the environment is important .
it 's edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .
so it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
so we 've made a silk card with penicillin in it .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they 're programmably degradable .
so i 'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food .
there 's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed , some about new aesthetics , new approaches to food .
in order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
and so a few years ago — fours years ago , actually — i set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
the idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli .
steaming ought to be faster .
`` well , that first cutaway picture worked , so we said , `` '' okay , let 's do some more . '' '' so here 's another one . ''
and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that 's going on .
here 's our hamburger cutaway .
buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
and the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
`` i said , `` '' it would have to show up free . '' '' and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half . ''
now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots .
what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh !
but now you will ; we put a biography of james watt in .
i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook .
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it .
the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
and whenever he came home , it was a different case .
but when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars .
it 's a ceremony . people are enjoying it .
it 's something that so many girls — i 'm lucky , i never died — but many die .
it 's practiced , it 's no anesthesia , it 's a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really could n't tell me what to do next .
but the problem is , my father is not the only father i have .
everybody who is my dad 's age , male in the community , is my father by default — my uncles , all of them — and they dictate what my future is .
i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here .
`` `` well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? '' ''
i promised him that i would be the best girl , i will come back , anything they wanted after that , i will do it for them .
i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . i had a right .
we have .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
we gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
you are somebody who wants to make a difference .
the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
the green areas are the areas we use to grow crops , like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever .
if you put it all together in one place , it 'd be the size of south america .
the second area , in brown , is the world 's pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
if we look at this carefully , we find it 's about 40 percent of the earth 's land surface is devoted to agriculture , and it 's 60 times larger than all the areas we complain about , our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live .
so this is an amazing kind of result , and it really shocked us when we looked at that .
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we 're mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
this is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is , this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region .
if you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest , or methane coming from cows and rice , or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers , it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity .
that 's more than all our transportation .
and yet , we do n't talk about it very much .
we have to provide food and feed and , yeah , fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today , and if anything , we 're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future . it 's not going to go away .
they have a lot of biodiversity , a lot of carbon , things we want to protect .
`` now , when i talk about this , people often tell me , `` '' well , is n't blank the answer ? '' '' — organic food , local food , gmos , new trade subsidies , new farm bills — and yeah , we have a lot of good ideas here , but not any one of these is a silver bullet . ''
in fact , what i think they are is more like silver buckshot .
now , having this conversation has been really hard , and we 've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy , to increase the collaboration .
today , we 're nearing 7 billion people .
we already know climate change is a big problem .
widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers .
it generates 30 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
as the world grows by several billion more people , we 'll need to double , maybe even triple , global food production .
advocates of commercial agriculture , environmental conservation , and organic farming ...
must work together .
here . here . here .
whether we 're born in san francisco , or sudan , or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy , we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust .
seti does n't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence ; it merely notes the possibility , if not the probability in this vast universe , which seems fairly uniform .
the numbers suggest a universe of possibilities .
well , what about 10^22 ?
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
that means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago .
so , up until now i 've been talking to you about really large numbers .
let me talk about a relatively small number .
so , our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history developing life , not anticipating its emergence .
so , one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos .
`` loren eiseley has said , `` '' one does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human . '' '' one day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien , and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations . ''
we are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution , and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story , and perhaps seti will help as well .
in northern california , we 're beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the allen telescope array — and i 've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research .
`` 2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first use of the telescope , darwin 's 200th birthday , the 150th anniversary of the publication of `` '' on the origin of species , '' '' the 50th anniversary of seti as a science , the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit , and of course , the 25th anniversary of ted . ''
`` well , to quote : `` '' the discovery of intelligent life beyond earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception . ''
we 'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint , complex signals that our current algorithms miss .
and , ultimately , we actually all belong to only one tribe , to earthlings .
the lines around the edges are a polymer .
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine , the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine .
there 's an example of the same thing on a finger , showing you basically what it looks like .
the second is , you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place .
it just — you do n't want to do that .
so , it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things .
it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay .
you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort .
and that problem is now , in a purely engineering way , solved .
so , it 's a solved problem , that particular problem is solved .
and so i regard that as done .
`` it 's what 's called `` '' fever of undiagnosed origin . '' '' someone comes into the clinic , they have a fever , they feel bad . what do they have ? ''
what you do about something which requires quantitative analysis ?
here is an example of a slightly more complicated device .
it measures the absorption of light in a sample the neat thing about this is , you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz , another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz , and so you can run this system in broad daylight .
so , let me finish by saying that we 've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem .
i know what it is but i do n't actually know what it means .
and they were sort , you know , blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious .
so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room , which was lovely .
george de mestral — this is not bugs all over a birkenstock — was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs , sort of little prickly things , and from that came velcro .
so , looking wide , using your peripheral vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity .
when you 're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine — which was the procedure that this device 's data was about ; it was for pain management — you 're shit scared ; you 're freaking out .
and i think that 's really , really important .
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?
hammer it together . hammer it together with a shoe , if you 're me , because they 're impossible to assemble .
so the first thing you have to do — this is graham , the designer — is , sort of , put yourself in their shoes . and so , here he is sitting under the table .
( laughter ) it 's this , and i think this is a particularly lovely solution .
so , you know , it 's a totally different way of looking at the situation .
( laughter ) but a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary , and i think that 's one of the things .
and putting yourself in the position of the person , and i think that 's one of the threads that i 've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel ?
it 's about this really .
when you put yourself in the position of these people , things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle , become much more relevant than the form of it . the way it 's produced , it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials .
we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start , no pun intended , their next project .
so , the first set of pathologies , they end up in the stick man on his icon , but the rest of them are really what 's important here .
it is a data point of steven in a context .
and he could still hold his wife 's hand , but he could n't do buttons on his clothes , ca n't feed himself .
there are so many other people sharing their stories .
here is an m.s . patient .
you can see fibromyalgia , hiv , als , depression .
i want to talk to the 58 patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day .
and this is my brother 's profile .
wait , poor spinal capacity .
detrol . in the side effects for his drug , integrated into that , the stem cell transplant that he had , the first in the world , shared openly for anyone who wants to see it .
i want my brother 's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs , and all of the things that interact among those , the side effects , to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it , so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is .
and here 's another paper .
but the short story is : if you 're a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
`` i want to know now . can you help us ? '' '' so , we launched some tools , we let them track their blood levels . ''
`` it 's never going to work . you ca n't do it . '' '' so , i said , `` '' okay well we ca n't do that . then we can do something harder . '' '' ( laughter ) i ca n't say whether lithium works in all als patients , but i can say whether it works in humberto . ''
full information , the entire course of their disease .
so , you can see we matched them perfectly , perfectly .
i mean , i did n't know what was going to happen to him .
but my brother did n't . my brother went straight down the line .
i 've got to thank the 45,000 people that are doing this social experiment with us .
at the same time , i run a website on cool tools , where i issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology .
it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in 1829 .
and i 'm , this morning , going to talk about this for the first time .
and the trick that richard dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
so he 's saying , what do genes want ? the selfish gene .
this is an ant that stores its colleagues ' honey in its abdomen .
each one of these organisms that we 've described — that you 've seen from jamie and others , these magnificent things — what they 're doing , each one of them , is they 're hacking the rules of life .
we see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized .
and the last thing , i bring back this nudibranch .
this is all the contents of a japanese home .
and he was the king of england , and that was the entire wealth of england at the time .
and thirdly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche . and i 'm happy to say , i was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological , but that 's pretty evident .
this is niles eldredge . he was the co-developer with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites , or snails , and to do a morphological analysis , and try to derive their genealogical history over time .
and the answer is : all of them .
`` that is what we call an `` '' infinite game . '' '' that 's the definition of `` '' infinite game . '' '' a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing . ''
the origins of technology was not in 1829 , but was actually at the beginning of the big bang , and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed . the entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot , and it was so tight in there , there was no room for any difference at all .
there was no difference whatsoever . and at the big bang , what it expanded was the potential for difference .
those are all basically the same thing .
that 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
because the last 20 years , the somali woman has stood up .
( applause ) so empowering the women and giving the opportunity — we are there for them . they are not alone for this .
dm : for me , my mother was preparing [ me ] when i was a child to become a doctor , but i really did n't want to .
so that 's how i decided [ to do ] the same .
pm : so what is the biggest challenge working , mother and daughter , in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ?
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
( applause ) wait . wait .
so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today .
but sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .
he collected all kinds of case studies .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences .
others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
i 'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray .
i may fall , but i do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life .
we want to satisfy our individual desires .
individuals unite into a team , a movement or a nation , which is far more than the sum of its parts .
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals .
so here 's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection .
so within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other .
it 's not that hard a problem .
( music ) ( video ) jonathan haidt : we humans have many varieties of religious experience , as william james explained .
it 's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
we 're bees . we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment .
but sometimes we wonder : is this all there is ?
what 's missing is that we are homo duplex , but modern , secular society was built to satisfy our lower , profane selves .
it 's really comfortable down here on the lower level .
`` every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . '' '' jh : thank you . ''
`` i had bought a copy of this book , `` '' the universe and dr. einstein '' '' — a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle . ''
and that feeling has n't left me yet .
and i first begin with a pie chart — and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation — but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter — the stuff that we 're all made of — and that 's four percent of the universe .
and , among other things , they 're looking for dark matter .
it 's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there .
the reason why they have to work in winter is because they do n't have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and submersibles to do their work .
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter .
because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it 's full of cracks .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
is one of these things that astronomers do — they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively .
and these telescopes , among other things , they 're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .
the dry air is really good for telescopes , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies .
finally , i want to take you to antarctica .
some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in antarctica .
so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
and the weather can change as they 're putting together this whole assembly .
here , they ca n't do it with the kind shoes they 're wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get barefoot into the boxes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
and what i can say is , in 2016 , doctors are n't going to be walking around with stethoscopes .
there 's a whole lot better technology coming , and that 's part of the change in medicine .
we 're going to zoom in on that a little bit .
we 're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep .
the rem sleep , rapid eye movement , dream state , is in light green ; and light is gray , light sleep ; and deep sleep , the best restorative sleep , is that dark green .
why is this important ? because this is so much more sensitive .
and this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway .
this sets up consumer-driven healthcare .
it 's like a wireless accelerometer , pedometer .
but it really wants you to enter all your activity .
so this is the moment-by-moment , or minute-by-minute sleep .
and really interesting stuff .
that is , for men , 29 percent in the country over 60 have type ii diabetes , and women , although it 's less , it 's terribly high .
all these things are possible — some of them are very close , or already , as you heard , are available today , in some way or form .
asthma : large number , we could detect things like pollen count , air quality , respiratory rate . breast cancer , i 'll show you an example of that real quickly .
and obesity we already talked about , the ways to get to that .
( applause ) their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible , and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open . it looks like this , this whole building dedicated .
the other big thing , besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance , and that 's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital .
but , the future — we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants , and that 's going to get filled in more with low-frequency variants in the future .
an ipatch , irhythm , for atrial fibrillation .
we lose 700,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardiac death .
thanks for your attention .
if you remember that first decade of the web , it was really a static place .
so half the earth 's internet population is using facebook .
one of them is a sociological theory called homophily , which basically says people are friends with people like them .
we have good models of it .
and so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen .
i could start that business tomorrow , and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that .
and so i think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward , as these tools evolve and advance , means that we 're going to have an educated and empowered user base , and i think all of us can agree that that 's a pretty ideal way to go forward .
you do n't need to be on the front line , though , to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control , right ?
now , i hope that mayors do one day rule the world , but , you know , the fact is , we do n't hear any conversation , really , about what is happening in the south .
it 's spiky .
i call this turbo-urbanization , and it 's one of the key drivers of fragility .
the big apple , it took 150 years to get to eight million people .
now , what do these medium , large , mega- , and hypercities look like ?
what we 're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge .
and tokyo ? it 's 46 .
there 's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country .
violence is going virtual .
a wonderful example of this is coming from el salvador and los angeles , where the mayors in san salvador and los angeles are collaborating on getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members , offering tutoring , education , and in the process are helping incubate cease-fires and truces , and we 've seen homicide rates go down in san salvador , once the world 's most violent city , by 50 percent .
it 's gone from being brazil 's most dangerous city to one of its safest , and it did this by doubling down on information collection , hot spot mapping , and police reform , and in the process , it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years .
but we need to be careful .
so i have just one question : what are we waiting for ?
so he finally found an art dealer , a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .
van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death .
`` and he said , `` '' i 'll prove it . ''
`` according to his biographer , `` '' he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . '' '' ( laughter ) and he killed himself soon afterwards . ''
it looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
well there 's an answer that many people would give .
among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it 's always better to own an original than a forgery because there 's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries .
it 's simple , you tell them they 're from mcdonald 's .
it 's very simple : pour it from an expensive bottle .
everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine .
( laughter ) it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
( laughter ) a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome .
now often , a result of capgras syndrome is tragic .
`` `` '' research described a woman with capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover . '' '' but that was before she got capgras syndrome . ''
and the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you did n't adore .
`` the philosopher denis dutton in his wonderful book `` '' the art instinct '' '' makes the case that , `` '' the value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation . '' '' and that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery . ''
not bad . it 's also not good .
apparently to really enjoy the music of joshua bell , you have to know you 're listening to joshua bell .
so she 's struck with pity .
she reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
as many of you know , this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench , opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds — that period of silence .
the first shock hurts like hell .
and let me start by telling you , i gotcha .
we have also some images of honey from brooklyn .
i would like to encourage you to open your mind .
the downside , though , is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution .
`` `` '' how is that possible ? '' '' you may ask . ''
well , the answer is : through a three-headed device .
at almost the exact same time , i found out that my dad , who i was very , very close to , was gay .
he told me that one night in 1969 , a group of young black and latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in manhattan called the stonewall inn , and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement .
i want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original grand central booth .
this is 12-year-old joshua littman interviewing his mother , sarah .
as you may know , kids with asperger 's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially .
they usually have obsessions .
jl : did i turn out to be the son you wanted when i was born ?
did i meet your expectations ?
sl : and that helped when amy was born , but you are so incredibly special to me and i 'm so lucky to have you as my son .
( applause ) david isay : after this story ran on public radio , josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was .
nobody comes to get famous .
( applause ) we 've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
it 's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio , and it 's nice of you to keep the radio around the house .
ap : to my princess : the weather outside today is extremely rainy .
slowly and remarkably , they became friends , and when he was finally released from the penitentiary , oshea actually moved in next door to mary .
i did n't see him graduate , and now you 're going to college .
oi : i love you , lady . mj : i love you too , son .
in the interview , she talks with her daughter lesley about joining a gang as a young man , and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be .
participants know this recording will be heard long after they 're gone .
when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the prize , i was completely floored .
( applause ) ten years ago , i recorded a storycorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist , and became a well-known gay activist .
it was june 28 , 2012 , the anniversary of the stonewall riots .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
`` and we expected huge masterpieces ! '' '' but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life , search , thought , everything — just in a reduced , small version . ''
court : where ?
boy : so ?
marcus : so i 've done my bit for queen and country , now i work for myself .
boy : look man , reading do n't feed no one .
boy : yeah , you could say that .
boy : what 's that supposed to mean ?
fuckin’ wicked , man . i saw the movie . bad ! what ?
woman 1 : yes .
woman 2 : they suck ? what about yours ?
and so it’s really — it 's really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997 , which is the time of abacha — the military dictatorship , the worst part of nigerian history , this post-colonial history .
again , this was my — this was me talking about — this was , again , the time of multiculturalism in the united kingdom , and there was this buzzword — and it was trying to say , what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ?
what happens with that ?
so that whole thing , that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .
( video ) voice : onicha , off to school with your brother .
c : this is the gun .
we did n't eat .
me .
i’m interested .
well done , well done .
that is what you are here for , no ?
mr. ezra gelehun , please stand .
e : we were fighting for our freedom .
our government was corrupt .
e : you are richer than us .
e : so you are a liar .
and i remember i met a lot of child soldiers — ex-combatants , as they like to be called .
eo : thank you .
that 's it , that 's the secret .
we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting .
we pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide .
200 million dollars is just way too expensive .
the cars team shifted their perspective .
and that sends energy back down the tether .
and the longer it survives that pressure , the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world .
we 're trying to make balloon-powered internet .
it turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata .
it worked .
could we get the balloon bandwidth high enough so it was a real internet connection ?
could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas ?
we busted a lot of balloons .
so there are two compartments here , one with air and then one with helium .
the balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier , or lets air out to make it lighter .
it floats up or down , hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants .
will people laugh at me ?
`` will i be fired ? '' '' i started with our secret . ''
we believe in dreams at the moonshot factory .
we 'll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine .
and we came up with some parameters , because , you know , building a rube goldberg machine has limitations , but it also is pretty wide open .
and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song .
it does n't matter what temperature it is , does n't matter what 's in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
small stuff stinks , but , of course , it 's essential , right ?
these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
the big , real car works every time ; there 's no problem about it .
there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
what are we doing ? oh , just hanging out with our grammy . what what !
( cheering )
but as we enter this era of big data , what we 're beginning to find is there 's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different , capable of changing the questions we want to ask , and this difference is not about how much data we collect , it 's whether those data open new windows into our universe , whether they change the way we view the sky .
what is the next chapter for astronomy ?
about the evolution of our universe .
if we could hear it , it would be popping like a bag of popcorn .
this swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun , and it 's these changes and the motion and it 's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe , to predict its future and to explain its past .
well , how do you capture an image at this scale ?
and this camera will image the sky , taking a new picture every 20 seconds , constantly scanning the sky so every three nights , we 'll get a completely new view of the skies above chile .
now , thousands of discoveries will come from this project , but i 'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale .
these are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to , to mine them for minerals , but they 're also the asteroids that may one day impact the earth , like happened 60 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs , or just at the beginning of the last century , when an asteroid wiped out almost 1,000 square miles of siberian forest , or even just last year , as one burnt up over russia , releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb .
the first time was in 1929 , when an astronomer called edwin hubble showed that the universe was expanding , leading to the ideas of the big bang .
so what is the next revolution likely to be ?
it took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky .
thank you .
and we talk about different ideas — he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart .
nevertheless , there are giants in the ocean , and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware .
i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan .
it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit , a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week . ( laughter ) i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet , unobtrusive platforms for exploration .
the approach worked .
( applause ) ew : the full monty .
now , what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light , and that 's all dr. kubodera could see when the giant comes in here .
how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now ?
so , we 've made a whole series of instruments .
one of the largest collections is called the brain opera .
so , the model works , but it 's only the tip of the iceberg , because my second idea is that it 's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero .
who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing — and a software package called hyperscore , which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music . extremely easy to use , but once you use it , you can go quite deep — music in any style . and then , by pressing a button , it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces .
so , one of the growing fields that we 're working on at the media lab right now is music , mind and health .
`` a lot of you have probably seen oliver sacks ' wonderful new book called `` '' musicophilia '' '' . it 's on sale in the bookstore . it 's a great book . ''
if you have n't seen it , it 's worth reading . he 's a pianist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples ' lives in unusual situations .
to get their hands on music , to shape it themselves , change it , to experiment with it , to make their own music .
these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character , simon powers , and his family . there are a whole series of them , kind of like a greek chorus .
they observe the action . we 've designed these square robots that we 're testing right now at mit called operabots . these operabots follow my music .
every single book is robotic , so they all move , they all make sound , and when you put them all together , they turn into these walls , which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers . so he 's disappeared , but the whole physical environment becomes this person .
so instead of being grand opera , this opera will turn into what we 're thinking of as personal opera .
and i 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage , so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .
so , can you give a hand to adam boulanger , ph.d. student from the mit media lab , and dan ellsey . dan , thanks to ted and to bombardier flexjet , dan is here with us today all the way from tewksbury . he 's a resident at tewksbury hospital .
he makes his own cds . actually , he is quite well known in the boston area — mentors people at the hospital and children , locally , in how to make their own music .
adam boulanger : yes . so , tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person , and he 's an intelligent and creative person . and it 's in his face , it 's in his breathing , it 's in his eyes . how come he ca n't perform one of his pieces of music ? that 's our responsibility , and it does n't make sense .
so all the parameter fitting , and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just dan .
and , you know , i think this is a perspective shift . it 's not that our technologies — they provide access , they allow us to create pieces of creative work .
so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into hyperscore .
he can place those exactly where he wants .
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen .
i think it gives an understanding of how we 're picking out movement from what dan 's doing , but i think it will also show you , if you look at that movement , that when dan makes music , his motions are very purposeful , very precise , very disciplined and they 're also very beautiful .
`` tm : ok , now dan will play his piece `` '' my eagle song '' '' for you . ''
this buzzing is a cicada .
it 's actually singing to each other over a great distance .
well , we had people .
we 're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road , there 's certainly no electricity , but they had very good cell phone service , these people in the towns were on facebook all the time , they 're surfing the web on their phones , and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest , pick up the sounds of chainsaws programmatically , because people ca n't hear them , and send an alert .
it 's the second highest contributor to climate change .
also , according to interpol , as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging , like the illegal logging that we saw .
it might just be the cheapest , fastest way to fight climate change .
it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut .
it 's not about seeing a tree from a satellite in an area that 's been clear cut , it 's about real-time intervention .
they 're full of sensors .
these are strips that are cut down .
well , to test it , we took it back to indonesia , not the same place , but another place , to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging .
people from around the world started to send us emails , phone calls .
( applause )
i first went to antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
it was lit only by the dim , green glow of the emergency exit sign .
1,400 people were coming .
and in just a few hours , jarrett would walk out on the same stage , he 'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music , he would begin to play .
and he stood up twisting , pounding down on the keys , desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row .
he did n't want to play .
we do n't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles .
and the reason is , the difficult font had slowed them down , forced them to work a bit harder , to think a bit more about what they were reading , to interpret it ...
the psychologist shelley carson has been testing harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters .
what do i mean by that ?
these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill .
let 's talk about complexity science .
you tweak it , you test it , you improve it .
and there were two treatments in this experiment .
actually , they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively .
they did n't think they 'd done a good job even though they had .
these disruptions help us solve problems , they help us become more creative .
so i want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n ' roll .
it 's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano .
and when they 're stuck in the studio , brian eno will reach for one of the cards .
he 'll draw one at random , and he 'll make the band follow the instructions on the card .
just because you do n't like it does n't mean it is n't helping you .
and what brian eno came to realize was , yes , we need to run the stupid experiments , we need to deal with the awkward strangers , we need to try to read the ugly fonts .
because what we actually count truly counts .
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of maslow 's hierarchy of needs .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
so as leaders , we understand that intangibles are important , but we do n't have a clue how to measure them .
`` so here 's another einstein quote : `` '' not everything that can be counted counts , and not everything that counts can be counted . '' '' i hate to argue with einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually ca n't be counted or valued , are n't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane ? ''
it 's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
over dinner , i asked him an impertinent question .
time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world .
how many know him ? anybody ?
bhutan 's created the ultimate export , a new global currency of well-being , and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh .
so how do we do that ?
they 're about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not .
and yet , 64 percent of the world 's gdp today is in that intangible industry we call service , the service industry , the industry i 'm in .
maybe it 's time we get a toolbox that does n't just count what 's easily counted , the tangible in life , but actually counts what we most value , the things that are intangible .
i was also a curious economics major as an undergrad .
i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
this is dave arringdale who 's actually been a longtime guest at vivian 's motel .
and the other was that i had access to good treatment .
i suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the dsm .
i 'm alive and grateful .
i 'd like to talk to you about the health and care of the most vulnerable population in our country — those people dealing with the most complex serious health issues .
i 'd like to talk to you about economics as well .
and , more often than not , they die sooner .
how can this be ?
we miss the human being .
`` i ca n't drive you around on it because i can barely pedal a bicycle , but let 's see what we can do . '' '' richard came to me , and he was in rough shape . ''
`` i said , `` '' alright , let 's take it one day at a time , '' '' like we do in every other chapter of our life . ''
again , because we goofy , long white-coat physicians are trained and of the mantra of dealing with this , not with this .
but this conversation today is not about dying , it is about living .
we have vast budget deficits .
this is my global public debt clock , and , as you can see , it 's 32 trillion and counting .
and i think what this leads to is a very simple recognition , that there 's one question in politics at the moment above all other , and it 's this one : how do we make things better without spending more money ?
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being — things like your family relationships , friendship , community , values — then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics .
so , starting with the political philosophy .
and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today , i think you can completely , as i 've said , remake politics , remake government , remake your public services .
well , i 'm afraid you 're going to suffer a short , condensed history lesson about what i would say are the three passages of history : the pre-bureaucratic age , the bureaucratic age and what we now live in , which i think is a post-bureaucratic age .
so this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . there we are .
now , what does this mean for our politics , for our public services , for our government ?
and always as a child i had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me .
( laughter ) but that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight , seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you .
so although i had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead , and had no clue quite what was going to happen , i was alive .
it was a lot of hard work .
and i do n't know who 's watching who , but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me .
you 've got to figure out what they actually meant .
i liked it sighted . it was fine .
`` `` go for it , brother . '' ''
i did n't get that sighted .
and i know it bothers some of my blind friends , it 's not just me .
so if you design a city with the blind in mind , you 'll have a rich , walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level .
if you 're blind , you do n't drive . ( laughter ) they do n't like it when you drive . ( laughter ) if you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around . if you design a city with the blind in mind ,
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that 's outside , you 'll see that there 's a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
thank you .
they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis , and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls , but at the same time they excited him .
the point is then recorded into a 3d visualization program .
these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second .
so , as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry .
we 're losing our sites and the stories , and basically we 're losing a piece — and a significant piece — of our collective memory .
two years ago , we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site , a unesco heritage site in uganda , the royal kasubi tombs .
( applause ) and doug pritchard , who 's the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art .
let 's give them a hand .
the united states is lesterland .
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle , understated , camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy .
`` leslie byrne , a democrat from virginia , describes that when she went to congress , she was told by a colleague , `` '' always lean to the green . '' '' then to clarify , she went on , `` '' he was not an environmentalist . '' '' ( laughter ) so here too we have a democracy , a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people , competing dependencies , possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are . ''
`` the united states is worse than lesterland , worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said , `` hey , you get to pick who gets to run in the general election , '' we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters . ''
`` we have lesters from everywhere . we could think , `` what could we do to make lesterland better ? '' ''
now this is a dependence too , but it 's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people .
now , there 's good news and bad news about this corruption .
one bit of good news is that it 's bipartisan , equal-opportunity corruption .
so the right wants smaller government .
when al gore was vice president , his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry .
i can only find cheese . i 'm sorry . so there it is .
okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head , a business model focused on their life after government , their life as lobbyists .
this is a solvable issue .
but this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
it 's solvable by being citizens , by being citizens , by being tedizens .
`` i spoke at dartmouth once , and a woman stood up after i spoke , i write in my book , and she said to me , `` '' professor , you 've convinced me this is hopeless . hopeless . ''
`` and i imagined a doctor coming to me and saying , `` '' your son has terminal brain cancer , and there 's nothing you can do . ''
and then i saw the obvious link , because even we liberals love this country .
we lose something dear , something everyone in this room loves and cherishes , if we lose this republic , and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong .
`` when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in september of 1787 , he was stopped in the street by a woman who said , `` mr. franklin , what have you wrought ? '' ''
that 's what we 're after .
any cell phone , any gadget you can bring them , they can fix it .
even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed , and it 's a lot of tiny little parts . it 's not easy .
and then , the most important thing is , it gives us large math for low cost .
so it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices .
`` so we said , `` '' what are the steps required to empower the teacher ? '' '' how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway , and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally ? '' '' so we walked around . ''
so essentially , the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform .
( applause ) and we systematically field tested , because in the field testing we learned some important lessons , and we went through many iterations .
we extended this idea . we tested it many times over , and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy , but most importantly connect to a car battery , because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there 's not enough electricity or erratic electricity .
it 's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed .
so you 're going to put your thumb on top of this .
vinay venkatraman : yeah . that 's right . bg : okay .
basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world , and that 's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else .
i can help you with those later .
now the parents are really alarmed .
we 're finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
`` it 's my dad . are you there ? '' '' that last one 's an actual text message that we received . ''
and yeah , we 're there .
we do social change .
i want to prevent this shit from happening .
there 's something in new york city .
the police did it . it used to be just guess work , police work .
so think about the data from a crisis text line .
or maybe there 's some anecdotal evidence .
you could inform legislation .
you could inform school policy .
( applause )
now , if you 're my five-year-old , your internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies .
i do n't mean giving up the internet .
that is a public act of making media .
and then i go home and i browse the web and i 'm reading twitter , and that 's a private act of consuming media .
speak up . speak out . be a good person .
drown out the negative with the positive .
if you do n't like the 24/7 all kardashian all the time programming , you 've got to stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian 's sideboob .
( applause )
not anymore .
you 'd think it 'd be smooth , but it 's actually not .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
it could be anti-corrosion .
no water , no corrosion .
chris anderson : you guys did n't hear about us cutting out the design from ted ? ( laughter ) [ two minutes later ... ] he ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part .
then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies — new media falling very much into that mold .
well , it does n't have to be terrible .
and that is a slide taken from a tv set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
where you are now , all of a sudden , sitting in front of personal computers and video text — teletext systems , and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen ?
high-tech , high-touch . is n't that what some of you said ?
you have to probably stop . maybe not come to a grinding halt , but you 've got to sort of find that mouse . then you find the mouse , and you 're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen .
`` and then when you finally see where it is , then you 've got to move it to get the cursor over there , and then — `` '' bang '' '' — you 've got to hit a button or do whatever . ''
and we have never known how to do this technically , so this slide is a fake slide .
what i 'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there , but you have to keep a few things in mind .
so , what i will show you is ... it 's a rather boring book , but i 'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors are n't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment . and this is a book on how to repair a transmission .
nn : this is about the oil pan , or the oil filter and all that .
`` but did hang around the , quote , `` '' computer room , '' '' where there were quite a few computers , and learned this particular language called logo — and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun , it was very interesting . and one day , by chance , some visitors from the nie came by in their double-breasted suits looking at this setup , and none of the children who were normally there , except for this one child , were there . ''
`` he was , and he said , `` '' let me show you how this works , '' '' and they got an absolutely ingenuous , wonderful description of logo . ''
`` they were delighted , and by the time it was time to go see the principal , whom they 'd actually come to see — not the computer room — they went upstairs and they said , `` '' this is absolutely remarkable ! ''
and in fact , it 's a powerful educational instrument .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
you are a high-ranking military service member deployed to afghanistan .
we 've had various names for post-traumatic stress throughout the history of war : homesickness , soldier 's heart , shell shock , thousand-yard stare , for instance .
now , i believed in art therapy , but i was going to have to convince service members , big , tough , strong , manly military men , and some women too , to give art-making as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try .
a year later , he had only seen bfib twice , and both times bfib was smiling and the service member did n't feel anxious .
and for the first time in 23 years , i could actually talk about stuff openly to , like , anybody .
it 's just amazing .
it 's pretty amazing , is n't it ?
( applause ) i wish i could have shared this process with my grandfather , but i know that he would be thrilled that we are finding ways to help today 's and tomorrow 's service members heal , and finding the resources within them that they can call upon to heal themselves .
it 's a norm . it 's a social norm .
`` my phrase for this value of being with `` '' not like us '' '' is `` '' strangeness , '' '' and my point is that in today 's digitally intensive world , strangers are quite frankly not the point . ''
they belong to a world of people i know versus people i do n't know , and in the context of my digital relations , i 'm already doing things with people i do n't know .
the economies of the future depend on that .
we can reach them . there are paths that enable us to reach them .
he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these strong ties in our lives , actually have a homogenizing effect on us .
they produce sameness .
my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives , what kinds of new routines are possible .
people are always a combination of the two , and that combination is constantly changing .
strangeness is not about meeting strangers .
we have to change the norms .
what interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers ?
how might we think differently about our relations with people ? how might we think differently about our relations
in the context of this broad range of digital relations , safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation .
`` when this picture appeared , that well-known scientific journal , the new york times , wrote in its editorial , `` '' mars is uninteresting . ''
one of the most intriguing features about mars , the national academy of science says one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age , is why certain areas of mars are so highly magnetized .
is there water on mars ?
we believe there 's some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
this is from spirit and opportunity .
these images that show at one time , there was very fast flowing water on the surface of mars .
here is some picture of antarctica and a picture of olympus mons , very similar features , glaciers .
well , we have an idea .
there are n't many craters .
in the southern hemisphere there are impact craters , there are volcanic craters .
look where the methane is , the methane is in a very rough terrain area .
we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
this is a 20-percent scale model .
and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .
this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars .
we will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems .
we will pinpoint where these gases emanate from , because we can measure the gradient where it comes from , and there , we can direct the next mission to land right in that area .
this is how we do it .
joel levine : this is a launch from the kennedy space center in florida .
it enters the atmosphere of mars .
a lot of heating , frictional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour .
a parachute opens up to slow it down .
now , 100,000 feet , if you fly cross-country to los angeles , you fly 37,000 feet .
this is a high-altitude helium balloon .
and we 've done high-altitude and low-altitude tests , just to perfect this technique .
we 're ready to go . all we need is a check from nasa headquarters ( laughter ) to cover the costs .
good morning . i think , as a grumpy eastern european , i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning . so bear with me .
however , to my surprise , i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily .
to put it very simply , the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevitably follow .
so , the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology .
why are they engaging with cyberspace ?
and , again , this is happening quite often .
just to give you an example of how it works in china , for example .
and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what 's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace .
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise , low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what 's actually happening in the country , right ?
secondly , involving public in any decision making is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail .
`` because they say , `` '' well look , we asked you , we consulted you , you voted on it . ''
i mean , anyone who has been to russia would know that there was no planning in russia for the next month .
and this is realistic . and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space , a total rip-off from abraham maslow .
because even what has been happening up 'til now with the spinternet and authoritarian deliberation , there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard .
a couple of years ago , harvard business school chose the best business model of that year .
and i learned these two facts , and i thought , what 's going on in shipping ?
because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry , something brought by sailboat with moby dicks and jack sparrows .
but shipping is n't that .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
we are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work .
so that was a normal working ship .
you can get a flag from the landlocked nation of bolivia , or mongolia , or north korea , though that 's not very popular .
when are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles ?
a humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean .
all of you , right ? palm up .
but it was six moves . now with one move .
i start here , palm down , you can follow .
and then look at me .
so , if we are — if we have five person , and i will do a five-handed poker game .
and two tens .
i work with kind of estimation , shuffle tracking — ah , good .
lg : here — you see some are missing ?
shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards , even if another person shuffles .
direct in the right brain , that 's much better . and so — ( laughter ) — arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing .
( laughter ) ah , not in order , it — that was a mistake .
but now i 'm glad i remember it .
now , you can carry this in your wallet , so ...
but not too much .
but now i do it the regular speed , right ?
we can take some over there later . so now , i will drop the cards .
here , i will do the most difficult thing .
and now , when i lift this card , it shall be your card . what was your card ?
and queen of hearts . yes !
so , now a false count .
this — oh sorry , do n't look at the beam . my fault .
( laughter ) this is high-frequency laser , and it 's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely .
right , sorry , my — i should have mentioned that , yeah .
did the camera got it ?
do the cameras see the cards now ?
so now , that was the reason , right ?
( laughter ) so every time i lift the heap , i peek , right .
perfect , excellent .
so i find ...
( audience : armani . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : armani . ) ( laughter ) lg : it was after the blindfold .
ok , a suit . i had clubs before , spades .
we try . yeah . you help me .
( laughter ) i think we have it now . yeah , good , good .
maybe it 's important — yeah — nine of diamonds , ok .
so now — i always ask , why do i put myself in this position ?
i have to figure out so many outs , when i miss some cards , but i love it . so now , i will do it . i will try to find the diamonds , but i will do it the hard way .
aargh !
looks good , like batman . ow !
the last .
now you must agree that i 'm — i must rely on other senses , right ?
lg : good . good . two — ( applause ) — thank you .
i never ever miss two . this is interesting .
sorry , two of diamonds . i 'll do it quick now .
ca : you 're peeking . you just got to — this is a request from the lady in the back .
and this is face up , and it 's not at the bottom here .
so next card will be — was it five ?
right ?
ca : king of diamonds . lg : ah !
so what i 'm going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you 'd like to see .
`` ( laughter ) so the main element though , the main complaint we get — and one that i find most worrying — is that people say , `` '' oh , why do you insist on ruining the magic ? ''
`` you bring in science , and it ruins the magic . '' '' now i 'm an arts graduate ; i love myth and magic and existentialism and self-loathing . ''
that is gone .
this is a wonderful thing .
`` if the sun could one day — and indeed the earth , in fact — if the earth could read its own astrological , astronomical chart , one day it would say , `` '' not a good day for making plans . ''
remember that in the majority of universes , you do n't even exist in the first place .
even on my journey up here — the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time .
but for me , it does n't . that is a wonderful thing .
i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation .
that one moment profoundly affected how i think about art , design and engineering .
my dad , john ferren , who died when i was 15 , was an artist by both passion and profession , as is my mom , rae .
i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy .
dad explained that this was n't a big open hole , but it was called the oculus , an eye to the heavens .
it was modern , high-tech , impressive , a huge 142-foot clear span which , not coincidentally , was exactly its height .
and this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds .
so what came after the moon ?
perhaps counterintuitively , i 'm guessing it 's a visionary idea from the late 1930s that 's been revived every decade since : autonomous vehicles .
although perhaps not obvious today , autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and , by extension , civilization .
automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically .
this was solved neatly by the gps system , global positioning system , that the u.s. government put in place .
the wireless technologies developed for mobile devices , with some minor modifications , are completely suitable to solve this .
besides , once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant , and it 's okay to keep driving , every other car on the surface of the earth will know that from that point on .
we need to love them and help them discover their passions .
thank you .
`` liespotters are n't those nitpicky kids , those kids in the back of the room that are shouting , `` '' gotcha ! gotcha ! ''
`` so sorry . '' '' but there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception . ''
women lie more to protect other people .
if you 're unmarried , that number drops to three .
five-year-olds lie outright .
well first we heard what 's known as a non-contracted denial .
do n't overdo the botox ; nobody will think you 're honest .
now we 're going to look at the hot spots .
can you tell what 's happening in a conversation ?
`` we say `` '' yes , '' '' we shake our heads `` '' no . '' '' we tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders . ''
they 're not proof of deception .
and as i promised , we 're now going to look at what the truth looks like .
it 's very nice to be here tonight .
so fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the united states and europe over the past century .
so this is the share of total income going to the top 10 percent .
so you can see that one century ago , it was between 45 and 50 percent in europe and a little bit above 40 percent in the u.s. , so there was more inequality in europe .
okay , so that 's fact number one , and that 's very important for what follows .
so today what you have is what i call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
so this is an important change , and it 's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre-world war i levels , although the total quantity of wealth has recovered .
so what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality , and what 's going to happen in the future .
growth was maybe 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 percent , but very slow growth of population and output per capita , whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent .
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
now , apparently that 's not going to last for very long , or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future , and the best projections we have is that the long-run growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent .
this is the after-tax rate of return , and after destruction , and this is what brought the average rate of return after tax , after destruction , below the growth rate during a long time period .
the first thing is that i think we need more financial transparency .
but this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
i think one century ago , many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened .
we are going to have a treaty with half of the world gdp around the table with the u.s. and the european union , so if half of the world gdp is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits , what does it take ?
so i think these are not technical difficulties .
i think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity .
it is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons .
let me say that if i was to rewrite the book today , i would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality , particularly in the united states , has been actually higher than what i report in my book .
why so many mysteries ? what is it about mystery that i seem to be drawn to ?
and i was thinking about this , what to talk about at ted .
why do i do so much stuff that involves mystery ? and i started trying to figure it out .
and i 'm obsessed with , like , engineering of paper .
but like , the scoring of it , the printing of it , where the thing gets glued , you know , the registration marks for the ink . i just love boxes .
but i 've had this forever .
now , i was looking at this , it was in my office , as it always is , on the shelf , and i was thinking , why have i not opened this ?
and i realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination .
`` in how — in the creation of `` '' lost , '' '' damon lindelof and i , who created the show with me , we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do . we had 11 and a half weeks to write it , cast it , crew it , shoot it , cut it , post it , turn in a two-hour pilot . ''
there was no time to develop it .
claire : help ! please help me ! help me ! help me !
and part of that was the amazing availability of technology , knowing we could do anything . i mean , we could never have done that .
`` i used to have the `` '' ordinary people '' '' script that i 'd flip through . ''
i wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did .
you know , i love apple computers . i 'm obsessed .
`` in `` '' alien '' '' , they never really showed the alien : terrifying ! ''
and they 're in the car , and it 's loud , and so they put the top up .
`` well , it 's not . `` `` e.t . '' '' is about divorce . `` `` e.t . '' '' is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who ca n't find his way . ''
`` `` '' die hard , '' '' right ? crazy , great , fun , action-adventure movie in a building . ''
there are great scenes — maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time , but pretty great scenes .
`` these are the kind of , you know , scenes that you remember and expect from `` '' jaws . '' '' and she 's being eaten ; there 's a shark . ''
father : c'mere . give us a kiss .
you know ? you go to the theater , you 're just so excited to see anything .
six years ago they did this . this is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience . but the point was , that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had — everyone has now .
what i 've realized is what my grandfather did for me when i was a kid , everyone has access to now .
he 's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff i 've seen released from hollywood .
and when i think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced , you know — who have been silenced in the past — it 's a very exciting thing .
so .
so i 'm a social psychologist , and i study morality , and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds .
there are only a few species that can do it .
now that process feels great . it feels really satisfying .
but then , after world war i , things dropped , and we get this historically low level of polarization .
so look at this data . this is from the american national elections survey .
it 's like put out in the two oceans and it 's pulling the whole country apart , pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips .
we will never again have just three television networks , all of which are relatively centrist .
from my experience , and from what i 've heard from congressional insiders , most of the people going to congress are good , hard-working , intelligent people who really want to solve problems , but once they get there , they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking .
so there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this .
but i 'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick , and the trick is this .
rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy .
`` the left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now , and the right says , `` '' huh , what ? hmm ? no problem . no problem . '' '' now , why is that happening to us ? why is the inequality rising ? ''
most hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers .
this means that there 's much less money coming into the house .
well , congratulations , you guys are the inaugural members of the asteroids club , which is a club for all americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point .
and so , because the prison-industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls , groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right on crime .
many years ago , when i was born in the '50s — '50s and '60s did n't belong to girls in india .
one is a british , another is an american and the third is a canadian .
so we are four of us in four corners of the world .
it 's like a death of a relative , or a cyclone , or a hurricane , or an earthquake .
`` since i 'm a product of this philosophy , of 90/10 , and secondly , `` '' life on an incline , '' '' that 's the way i grew up to be valuing what i got . ''
this is something like a new definition ever given in policing in india — the power to prevent .
because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that 's it , or power to punish .
how do i prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
normally police officers do n't want to do prison .
`` they sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , `` '' now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to . ''
but 10,000 men , of which only 400 were women — 10,000 — 9,000 plus about 600 were men .
`` and i said , `` '' do you pray ? '' '' when i looked at the group , i said , `` '' do you pray ? '' '' they saw me as a young , short woman wearing a pathan suit . i said , `` '' do you pray ? '' '' ''
this was initiated in delhi prison .
that 's the second landmark .
this was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners .
and this is what transformed .
let me show you the next slide .
`` i took the same thing to the police , because police , equally , were prisoners of their minds , and they felt as if it was `` '' we '' '' and `` '' they , '' '' and that the people do n't cooperate . ''
this worked .
let me wrap it up .
and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide , if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state , not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance , but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential .
it 's really terrifying .
mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge , because different from health or education or housing , it tends to get worse as societies become richer .
there is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them .
the first one is equality of quality of life , especially for children , that all children should have , beyond the obvious health and education , access to green spaces , to sports facilities , to swimming pools , to music lessons .
in fact , when i became mayor , applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest , that a bus with 100 people has a right to 100 times more road space than a car , we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes .
and one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol , because as buses zoom by , expensive cars stuck in traffic , it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work .
it does n't take ph.d. 's .
for example , this system in guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in china , except for one line in beijing , at a fraction of the cost .
cities are human habitats , and we humans are pedestrians .
here they made a flyover , probably very useless , and they forgot to make a sidewalk .
this is prevailing all over the world .
indeed , a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city , which is road space .
how to distribute it between pedestrians , bicycles , public transport and cars ?
and we are living in a unique moment in history .
in the next 50 years , more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built .
so we could make different cities , cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars , that will give more public space to human beings than to cars , cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens , such as children or the elderly .
in new cities which are going to be built , this would not be particularly difficult .
of course , i would love to pave this street for cars .
and of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it , and it changes the way of life .
but unfortunately , reality is not as good as my dreams .
but even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places , very far from the city centers where it 's impossible to provide low-cost , high-frequency public transport .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that 's me .
she 's doing a lot better this year . she 's on the comeback trail .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the admonition , be perfect .
in high school , a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that 's why you have shortness of breath .
and that 's when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
well it turns out , he did n't have a strep throat .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
we see all the same symptoms .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
with aculab and patientslikeme , we 're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
max little : yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . tr : right .
so what that means is that people will be able to — ml : ( laughs ) tr : people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they 're doing in this course of the disease .
tr : thanks so much . max little , everybody .
ml : thanks , tom . ( applause )
at each meeting , there 's way too many ideas .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
so we thought like , this is too much of an opportunity , so we hired a feng shui master .
( laughter ) china has many great poets , but we discovered that in the people 's republic public school curriculum , they have three fairy tales by an tu sheng , or hans christian anderson , as we call him .
this is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
when you go to the exhibition , you 'll see the mermaid and the pool .
you 'll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo .
and because copenhagen is completely flat , if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view , you basically have to do it yourself .
so , the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy .
this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling .
( laughter ) it was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity .
at the same time , we actually had a visitor — a minister from azerbaijan came to our office .
and the buildings , they do n't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains , they also operate like mountains .
they create shelter from the wind .
they accumulate the solar energy .
thank you .
this one is more than 400 years old .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
i would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke .
`` the first embrace is something that we think , `` '' oh , this is very easy , '' '' but it 's actually getting harder , and that 's paying attention to the world around us . ''
you can see the sort of break in the everyday .
jb : it 's so powerful . richard ford , who 's won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do , sometimes pushing into what they ca n't do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
he 's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other .
`` richard serra : i was standing there looking at it , and i realized that velázquez was looking at me , and i thought , `` '' oh . i 'm the subject of the painting . '' '' and i thought , `` '' i 'm not going to be able to do that painting . '' '' i was to the point where i was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness , and i was n't getting anywhere . so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno , and i thought , i 'm going to just start playing around . ''
`` jb : richard serra says that so nonchalantly , you might have missed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for 300 years , and realized , `` '' i ca n't do that , '' '' and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and threw it in a river . ''
`` and i asked her , `` '' what would happen if i was a member of the press ? '' '' and she told me , `` '' oh , look back there , '' '' and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area , and i said , `` '' well , when do they go in ? '' '' and she said , `` '' probably never . '' '' and as i walked away from that , i had this crystallization , probably from the blow , because it was an insult in a way . ''
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
time is unstoppable , and it transforms the event .
`` the reality is , there 's the woolworth building in a veil of smoke from the site , but it 's now like a scrim across a theater , and it 's turning pink , you know , and down below there are hoses spraying , and the lights have come on for the evening , and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on , and i 'm thinking , `` '' my god , who could dream this up ? '' '' but the fact is , i 'm there , it looks like that , you have to take a picture . ''
but the person who put it back together , instead of hiding the cracks , decided to emphasize them , using gold lacquer to repair it .

well , there was too much of a correlation , he felt , between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water , and the judge was not impressed either .
well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a postcode — which is like a zip plus four — for a specific group of houses , you can make paper , print off a paper which has got very , very specific things about the bus stops , the things specifically near you .
it has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
at least , i know about my consciousness directly .
for much of the 20th century , that view held sway .
it 's not a science of explanations .
i want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , i banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work .
on the one hand , it 's a datum that we 're conscious .
these fundamental properties and laws are n't explained in terms of anything more basic .
if you ca n't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space , time , mass , charge — then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list .
the natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature .
this does n't mean you suddenly ca n't do science with it .
this view is sometimes called panpsychism : pan for all , psych for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even rob knight 's microbes , elementary particles .
`` it 's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it 's thinking , `` '' aww , i 'm always buzzing around near the speed of light . ''
in effect , he 's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness : high phi , high consciousness .
it describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it does n't tell us about the reality that underlies it .
i used to think i should n't eat anything which is conscious , so therefore i should be vegetarian .
now , if you 're a panpsychist and you take that view , you 're going to go very hungry .
`` what about the artificially intelligent system in the movie `` '' her , '' '' samantha ? ''
i mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
those reefs at discovery bay , jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years .
people came to study our reefs from australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
`` we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . '' '' and we published a paper in science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane . ''
and that is the same reef ; that 's the same reef 15 years ago ; that 's the same reef today .
`` it fed the slaves brought to the antilles , the song `` '' jamaica farewell '' '' — `` '' ackee rice salt fish are nice '' '' — is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada . ''
this is a photograph , a typical photograph , of what the continental shelves of the world look like .
what it is now is mud , and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud , to parking lot , is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity .
and all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .
and when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
i have talked about it a million times , but it 's unbelievable .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta , and the lower left of that picture is the texas-mexico border .
that 's the same species .
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .
and so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .
the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
`` the corals say , `` '' you cheated . you did n't pay your rent . '' '' they kick them out , and then they die . ''
it started a couple of years ago .
i was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the internet a little , when i found out that handel had written works for the keyboard .
and what happened next was that i entered this state of pure , unprejudiced amazement .
the first piece that i played through started like this .
i 've given a lot of children 's concerts for children of seven and eight years old , and whatever i play , whether it 's bach , beethoven , even stockhausen , or some jazzy music , they are open to hear it , really willing to listen , and they are comfortable doing so .
but the young ones , they do n't question their own opinion .
and i would like to invite you to do so now .
ca : most of american electricity comes from burning fossil fuels .
em : right . there 's two elements to that answer .
so if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine , you 'll get about 60 percent efficiency .
so given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation , then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport .
there 's just no way around newton 's third law .
ca : bruno bowden , who 's here , did that , broke the world record.em : congratulations .
not at all a dig at the new york times , this , by the way .
what is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car ?
you ca n't do that with a gasoline car .
so we 're at step two at this point .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we 're offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
em : well , as i mentioned earlier , we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption , so i 'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar .
ca : but in a gallon of gasoline , you have , effectively , thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space , so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar , and to remotely compete with , for example , natural gas , fracked natural gas . how are you going to build a business here ?
what are you doing ?
it works for decades . it 'll work for probably a century .
ca : but you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power .
ca : all right , so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself , i guess , a kind of crazy bet .
so that was a dream of yours , in a way , from a young age ?
there 's a long list of innovations that we 've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but — ca : not least because you could still get copied , right ?
but the big innovation is still ahead , and you 're working on it now . tell us about this .
em : right , so the big innovation— ca : in fact , let 's roll that video and you can talk us through it , what 's happening here .
em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they 're all expendable .
it 's much like on a jet .
so the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket .
ca : can we see that ? em : yeah .
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . ( laughter ) ca : all right , let 's see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
em : i do n't know , actually .
ca : well , i have a theory.em : okay . all right .
so i think that 's an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and solicit it , particularly from friends .
sometimes i used to walk more at night .
i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting .
and i took a picture of his shoes , and we thanked each other and just went on our way .
and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken , of course , or very , very surprising .
and often , i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i 'd never seen happen before .
i do n't get necessarily inspired by research .
and i saw this really smart critic who i love .
i know about a wolf and a bird and , you know , he ate the bird , and then in the end you hear , you know , you hear the bird squeaking , or something , you know ?
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time .
and so that 's what makes me lie awake at night , i guess , you know .
i want to show you — i 'm also like a big — i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often , and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot .
and i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago .
but i guess that 's okay . right ?
again , i do n't know where inspiration comes from .
and frankly , i do n't really know what to call myself .
and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
actually , could you roll the clip , please ?
rosie o'donnell : hello , ben .
im : look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back .
`` man : her grandmother says , `` '' delish ! '' '' im : ah , wow , delish . all right . so now where should i position myself ? ''
i want to stay out of the way .
im : just checking , because some people want to look , you know , aggressively ugly .
because just because if you 're fabulously rich , and fabulously famous , does that mean you should n't have kids , because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up ?
they 're going to be like 14 and in rehab .
then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dress or something .
this is what i 've been doing because i think it 's the most fun thing in the world .
chef : oh , you do n't know ? let me tell you something .
let me tell you something interesting .
just because i do n't know that whole — that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk .
im : churns ?
chef : so you take heavy , high-fat milk , which is cream , and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water .
thanks . bye .
i was about five years old at the time , and i decided there and then that i would become a paleontologist .
a few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a german paleontologist .
we were just finding bits and pieces and i was hoping that we 'd find a partial skeleton at some point .
`` i think the sahara 's still full of treasures , and when people tell me there are no places left to explore , i like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter , roy chapman andrews , and he said , `` '' always , there has been an adventure just around the corner — and the world is still full of corners . '' '' that was true many decades ago when roy chapman andrews wrote these lines . ''
and it is still true today .
tourist : it 's reality , it 's us . it happened here .
ja : the ramps are made of simple material — the kind of plywood you see at construction sites — which is really the whole point .
your work is highly sensual , even hedonistic .
`` in fact we 're finishing a book which is called `` '' pleasure , '' '' which is about sensual pleasure in spaces . ''
and that as people who create places , the ultimate way to help was n't to pontificate or to make up scenarios , but to help right now .
dr : it was not an inclusive group .
the city actually approached us .
ka : but then you 've got to figure out a way — we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board — but simply funding this thing .
and we also , frankly , knew that if it did n't happen by the end of the giuliani administration , then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the — we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time , and it was set up by the office of emergency management .
ka : and there was therefore this ticking clock , because giuliani was obviously out three months after that .
`` so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said , `` '' i 'm going to lock the door , because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this . '' '' and we said , `` '' well , this is half the size , it does n't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone — everyone in the city . ''
`` we 'd have to go back to the beginning to do this . '' '' and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed . ''
the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding .
so we did n't know what to do , but we decided to cast a very wide net .
so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer — as we said about the families ' platform — and the experience as possible .
to think of it as this purely temporary installation ?
and six months after the fact — and only a few months away from the site being cleaned — we are very quickly , now , getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious .
and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day ?
the scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable .
the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch .
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sampled dust .
another facet of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices .
what you 're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air , and how they vary over time .
we 're trying to prevent an impact .
so in this program that i undertook several years ago , i looked at a variety of different threads across science , across a variety of disciplines , that were pointing , i think , towards a single , underlying mechanism for intelligence .
so what you 're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force , f , that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action .
so i 'm going to show you now a video that will , i think , demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation .
just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
this tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture .
my equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future .
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
right ?
why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
the issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent .
a plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs co2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
so , the plant’s roots will extract these resources .
i’d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is .
as humans , where do we find it ?
it’s true that some humans eat better than others .
yes , it is . what is worse is that it is very expensive .
modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
by the end of this century , it will all be gone .
this mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
i haven’t invented anything at all ; it 's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years .
and instead of using a 100 percent dose , i’m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
you’ll see that of this 25 percent , most will benefit the plant , more than 90 percent .
this is to show you that this method works .
this is an example of soy production in canada .
and in those 50 years , not only did we literally , physically set foot on the moon , but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets — all eight of them — and we have landed on asteroids , we have rendezvoused with comets , and , at this point in time , we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto , the body formerly known as a planet .
it offers mystery , scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare , and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach .
it has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system .
its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen , like you are breathing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane .
and for us , it has been like — the cassini people — it has been like a jules verne adventure come true .
and yet another moon there — i do n't even know which one it is . it 's a very extensive atmosphere .
and we have taken pictures like this .
and what you see is bright and dark regions , and that 's about as far as it got for us .
and they converge into this channel here , which drains into this region .
but this is somewhat of a shoreline .
and here is the horizon , ok ?
and obviously , it landed in one of these flat , dark regions and it did n't sink out of sight . so it was n't fluid that we landed in .
and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan .
it is a very geologically active body .
and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s — and we 'd forgive you , if you were n't , ok — you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 .
chris anderson : we 're having a debate .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
they 've run out of good sites .
and the average , just for the construction time of these , is 7.1 years on top of any planning times .
and the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid , resulting if you use nuclear , or anything else , versus wind , csp or photovoltaics .
and so , on the right , you see gasoline emissions , the death rates of 2020 .
that 's the footprint that is always being confused .
that 's cellulosic , second generation biofuels from prairie grass .
here 's corn ethanol . it 's smaller .
matching the reliability , base load is actually irrelevant .
and it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour-by-hour power demand .
and one last slide i just want to show . this is the choice : you can either have wind or nuclear .
( applause ) ca : all right .
if you 're against , put up one .
now then , you guys have — you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said , challenge it , whatever .
that 's from real data .
and this is an ongoing research . this is not rocket science .
there 's absolutely no need for nuclear power .
rod beckstrom : thank you chris . i 'm rod beckstrom , ceo of icann .
i 've come around in the last 10 years .
and in the united states senate , we need bipartisan support — only one or two votes are needed — to move global warming through the senate , and this room can help .
the propaganda from the industry has been very , very strong .
tell me that those accidents are n't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years .
anyone else for ? go .
i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s , and i continue to do so now .
if we 're going to keep the lights on , nuclear is that solution .
i will also add one other thing .
it was a sunny day and a windy night .
and there 's much more solar than there is wind .
( shouts ) and all those against .
ooooh .
now that is — my take on that ...
`` those of you who changed your mind in favor of `` '' for '' '' put your hands up . ''
well , it has its pluses and minuses .
but ironically , this situation has empowered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social discourse in iran .
we are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world .
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression .
my journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
now i am making films .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film , the cry for democracy and social justice , repeats itself now again in tehran .
my job at twitter is to ensure user trust , protect user rights and keep users safe , both from each other and , at times , from themselves .
( laughter ) and i have to figure out what they 're doing , why , and whether or not there 's risk involved , often without much in terms of context or background .
so okay , determining whether or not something is abusive without context , definitely hard .
here 's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior , sending the exact same message to thousands of people .
we should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior .
this is often indicative of something called phishing , somebody trying to steal another person 's account information by directing them to another website .
that means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors , and even then , we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate .
so what do i do ?
( laughter ) but you still have to do it , particularly if you 're marrying 500 million tweets per day .
when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there 's a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
it 's the kind of complicated circle that i 'm going to tell you about .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved hers .
( applause )
for me , this story begins about 15 years ago , when i was a hospice doctor at the university of chicago .
and i was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness .
is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone ?
how big are the clusters ? how far do they reach ?
and then the next line over says if your friend 's friend 's friend , someone you probably do n't even know , is obese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
in addition , because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic , there 's not a patient zero of the obesity epidemic — if we find that guy , there was a spread of obesity out from him — it 's a multicentric epidemic .
every tie between them is a relationship .
why do we show our emotions ?
again , a social network , but now we color the people yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between .
whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes , but with yours .
and finally , we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes .
and what i think the world needs now is more connections .
now i 'm head of a biomaterials lab , and i 'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time .
it 's hard . it 's durable .
and this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses .
you 'd put them in the body and you would n't get an adverse response .
so what we do is , in humans , we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones .
those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops , and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
so it 's very , very low in terms of after-pain compared to an iliac crest harvest .
and i 'm just going to tell you , sometimes those contacts are very strange , slightly unexpected , and the very most interesting , let me put it that way , contact that i had , was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head .
and that 's led to a whole field , really , that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure .
and so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3d and give them a little bit more information .
and it would be really great , actually , if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate .
but now , the cells also would probably quite like a material that 's going to be able to be conductive , because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves .
( applause )
we cut roads through the forest .
and of course , we 've changed the chemistry of the air .
and under that definition , things look a little bit different .
so between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here , they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals , from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth , saber-toothed cats , all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us .
massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests , changed the composition of forest from one tree to another .
it 's awesome . national geographic sent me to manú national park , which is in the peruvian amazon , but it 's a big chunk of rainforest , uncleared , no roads , protected as a national park , one of the most , in fact , biodiverse parks in the world .
i mean , there 's , like , probably , a dozen , minimum , plant species growing there , supporting all kinds of insect life , and this is a completely unmanaged space , a completely wild space .
and in fact , i took a look , and banff national park is doing all of the things i just listed : suppressing fire , having fire , radio-collaring wolves , reintroducing bison .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and in a further irony , these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard , sometimes .
you ca n't take home the pinecones .
so this means that they 're only available to the elites , and that 's a real problem .
every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there .
so when you 're up there on that future high line of philadelphia , surrounded by this wildness , surrounded by this diversity , this abundance , this vibrance , you can look over the side and you can see a local playground for a local school , and that 's what it looks like .
i have a fort theory of ecology , fort theory of conservation .
they are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable .
here we have a demonstration of a three-month-old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker .
when we first moved to kenya , we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment , a team of 15 people , and that was what was needed to deliver health care .
the issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar .
each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable , and they 're locatable .
what 's more , we 've learned that this is something that we have n't built just for the community but with the community .
so for patients like mama wangari , who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren , for less than 40 dollars , we can restore her eyesight .
the reality is everyone goes blind on their own .
i thought about a lot of the people , in particular a lot of the men , in my life who i looked up to .
when i went to my mom , i first joined the army when i was 17 years old , so i literally needed parental permission to join the army , so i kind of gave the paperwork to my mom , and she just assumed it was kind of like military school .
when i first joined , i never joined to fight , but now that i was in , this is exactly what was now going to happen .
and i just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers .
i said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas .
it plays out in all of our emotions .
`` `` thank you for your service , '' and we move on . ''
the fact is , we have literally 2.6 million men and women who are veterans of iraq or afghanistan who are all amongst us .
he loses his leg in iraq .
`` medics come and they save her life , but then as she 's doing her recuperation back at home , she realizes that , `` '' my job 's still not done . '' '' and now she uses her voice as a congresswoman from illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues . ''
so , i had been there almost three months , and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along , and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around , he grabbed my hand for support , which is something most kenyans would never consider doing .
hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes ; the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof ; and we perspired as we ate .
`` `` '' for armstrong , southland was n't constrained by its material conditions . ''
hey , that 's a single family home in the squatter community .
these communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities .
beer is a very important thing in brazil .
so , that 's a restaurant .
people burn trash to get rid of the garbage , and they dig their own sewer channels .
that does not necessarily mean property rights , and i would disagree with hernando de soto on that question , because property rights create a lot of complications .
i have to say , it was n't exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
this australian-indian girl , she came out and started to dance on her front lawn , and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about , and he soon joined her .
these festivals are radically open .
companies like de la guarda , which i produce , and punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action , but the german performance company rimini protokoll takes this all to a whole new level .
they understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere .
you can do a show in a schoolroom , in an airport , — ( laughter ) — in a department store window .
`` for `` '' the sultan 's elephant , '' '' royal de luxe came to central london and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time-traveling elephant . ''
`` the guardian wrote , `` '' if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience . ''
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well-being .
`` she had gathered with others to watch 'the sultan 's elephant , ' and , you know , it just made all the difference . '' '' lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model . ''
but i 'm going to suggest to you that that 's going to change rather soon , and part of the reason , in fact , the majority of the reason why i think that 's going to change is that the equipment 's getting better .
but something that 's not appreciated by the public is , in fact , that the experiment continues to get better , and , consequently , tends to get faster .
this is a little plot , and every time you show a plot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
in fact , those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent , will note that this is a semi-log plot .
that 's a lot of real estate , but of course , most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless , like , you know , mercury , or neptune .
and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you : either we 're going to find e.t . in the next two dozen years , or i 'll buy you a cup of coffee .
so that 's not so bad . i mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your browser and there 's news of a signal , or you get a cup of coffee .
suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company .
i kept waiting for — i kept waiting for my mom to call , somebody to call , the government to call . nobody called .
nobody called . i was so nervous that i could n't sit down . i just wandered around taking photos like this one , just for something to do .
that 's what happens to me . it kind of ruins my whole week , because whatever i 've got planned that week is kind of out the window .
we will know that we 're not that miracle , right , that we 're just another duck in a row , we 're not the only kids on the block , and i think that that 's philosophically a very profound thing to learn .
you got ta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something .
here i am at about 15 or something , doing that sort of stuff .
i think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works , well , that 's a payoff beyond easy measure . thank you very much .
we face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries .
it 's looking to build its cities in different ways .
if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way , we will create waste , pollution , congestion , destruction of land and forests .
the next two decades are decisive for what we have to do .
the cities that are going to be built — and there are many , and many big ones — we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time and we can save energy .
again , breathing was a hazardous activity .
it would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent .
i think they 've got a good chance of doing that .
they hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , fundamental to the tackling of climate change .
but we 're losing our forests .
how ? by involving local communities , investing in their agriculture and their economies , by monitoring more carefully , by enforcing the law more strictly .
it was desperately poor . in the following years , it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict .
ethiopia is investing in clean energy .
we need leaders to step up .
our daughter — ( baby cries ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) — our daughter gave birth to rosa here in new york two weeks ago . here are helen and rosa . ( applause )
i went home from work early one day with what i thought was the flu , and less than 24 hours later i was in the hospital on life support with less than a two percent chance of living .
that day , i went home , i crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months : me passed out , escaping from reality , with my legs resting by my side .
( laughter ) ( applause ) or as short as i wanted , depending on who i was dating . ( laughter )
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
my leg maker and i put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that i could snowboard in .
eleven years ago , when i lost my legs , i had no idea what to expect .
and if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we 've been successful at reducing that re-offending , then we can do something we think rather interesting .
the idea is called the social impact bond .
now , the social impact bond is simply saying , if we can get the government to agree , that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked .
so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it did n't work , which for still quite a lot of bits of government , that 's a serious issue .
the service providers , well , for the first time , they 've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they 're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they 're doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
others , around homelessness in london , around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country .
why is this so different for people ?
the second piece it brings is rigor .
it looks and feels like it sounds : wormwood scrubs .
whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately , they failed to show the emotions required .
that turned out to be not such an easy task .
it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness .
the early years are crucial .
this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration .
in another decade , joe will be released from wormwood scrubs .
surely , that would be in the interest of all of us .
then i came to this country to study psychology and i started trying to understand the roots of happiness .
but this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
so existence is temporarily suspended .
now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out .
and it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
unfortunately , a lot of people 's experience is in apathy .
well when i was asked to do this tedtalk , i was really chuckled , because , you see , my father 's name was ted , and much of my life , especially my musical life , is really a talk that i 'm still having with him , or the part of me that he continues to be .
he did n't read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
yet , he was my greatest teacher .
and i think inspired by that memory , it 's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can , sort of pass it on through whatever means .
and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it 's like to be alive .
now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of , like concertos and symphonies , but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment — like this one from the beethoven violin concerto .
so many emotions seem to be inside of it .
yet , of course , like all music , it 's essentially not about anything .
it 's just a design of pitches and silence and time .
and whether we call them 440 per second , a , or 3,729 , b flat — trust me , that 's right — they 're just phenomena .
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music 's powerful silent partner , the way it 's been passed on : notation .
but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason , instinct and intelligence .
37 freakin ' vibrations .
at the same time technology , by taking over the role that notation had always played , shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .
`` well let me show you a story of what i mean by `` '' really sticking with us . '' '' i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home , and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker . ''
`` that 's what drives my interest in projects like the tv series `` '' keeping score '' '' with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music , and working with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education . ''
sure , the big events attract a lot of attention , but what really matters is what goes on every single day .
you do n't need to worry about knowing anything .
you can start anywhere . ramble a bit .
after these two days , and during a particularly intense encounter , it was presumed that the leader of la familia michoacana , nazario moreno , was killed .
the idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state .
the two marches joined together , and they continued their path towards the state capital .
implicitly or explicitly , there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade , and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner , or , most likely , both .
i urge you , but only a little bit , because i do n't want to get you in trouble , to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want , wherever you want it , whenever you want it , anywhere in the u.s. , and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message , they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less .
you will read that los zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press , and this is somewhat true , or mostly true .
they , as social enterprises do , have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around , and they have very strict recruiting practices .
they have cultivated a brand of professionalism , business acumen and innovation .
`` they have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border , and you can see that these are not `` '' the shawshank redemption '' '' types . ''
they have invented drones to transport drugs , catapults , you name it .
like any traditional latin american multinational would , the way they control their operations is through family ties .
and so what i want you to remember from this talk are three things .
`` ( laughter ) ( `` '' 10,000 missiles '' '' ) this is the context . this is where we are now in israel . ''
most of the time , i make posters , i post them on facebook , my friends like it , do n't like it , most of the time do n't like it , do n't share it , do n't nothing , and it 's another day .
because you have to understand , in israel we do n't talk with people from iran .
so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them , give me a picture , i will make you a poster .
and that 's how it started . and that 's how , really , it 's unleashed , because suddenly people from facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it .
`` tell the iranians we from israel love you too . '' '' it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . ''
so for a few days , that 's how my living room was .
`` and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , `` '' okay , let 's talk about this . '' '' and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , `` who 's gon na see the show ? `` and he said , `` everybody . '' ''
`` so she said , `` '' everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ? ''
and we were just at the beginning of the story .
`` the moment i really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , `` google the word 'israel . ' '' and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing , `` '' israel '' '' or `` '' iran . '' '' we really changed how people see the middle east . ''
because you 're not in the middle east .
this is the enemy .
and you become friends .
i know how it can look really bad .
just raise that . exactly .
thank you guys .
except here it’s been split up in parts by estée lauder and by the perfumer who did it , calice becker , and i 'm most grateful to them for this .
smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person .
( laughter ) you really don’t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery .
and that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
however , i came to realize gradually that they may be right — and i have to convince all my colleagues that this is so , but i’m working on it .
here’s how shape works in normal receptors .
and of these 45 molecules , only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood .
i love the idea of doing less work . so let me explain to you why — a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well .
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol . it smells of cut grass .
now , you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs .
so this is the sound of the o-h stretch , translated into the audible range .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
now , the slight fly in the ointment is this : that if we smell molecular vibrations , we must have a spectroscope in our nose .
ok , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
what’s nice about this idea , if you have a philosophical bent of mind , is that then it tells you that the nose , the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses .
and the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin , and you smooth it out , so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord , so to speak , of coumarin is .
you see , when you’re a scientist , you’re always selling ideas .
ok ? now , we’re dealing with people who only want results , and this is the commercial world .
in june of 1998 , tori murden mcclure left nags head , north carolina for france .
tori and her friends built it by hand , and it weighed about 1,800 pounds .
several years earlier , she 'd become the first woman to ski to the south pole .
most days looked like this .
and as frustrating as those days were , other days were like this .
( video ) tmm : do you guys have a weather report , over ?
( video ) tmm : just sprained my ankle .
her boat kept capsizing .
in 1998 , i was a high school student living in louisville , kentucky .
in this scene , she sits at home .
ooh .
one day , at lunch with her new boss , tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid-atlantic , to do something that she almost died trying to do .
so we thought , would that even be possible ?
( video ) ( gunfire ) we learned that during those times , people in communities really stick together during these times of hardship , but we also learned a very important element , the importance of barbecues . ( laughter ) because , when you throw a barbecue , it turns you from a guest into a host , so we decided to throw one almost every other week , and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood .
jk : we still had this idea of the hill , though .
we had no idea how , but it seemed like a very interesting challenge , so we did exactly the same as we did in rio , and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing .
( applause ) and at the end , the city of philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment .
we started looking for funding , but instead , we just ran into questions , like , how many houses are you going to paint ?
how much paint are you going to use , and how many people are you going to employ ?
du : so what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea , which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art .
jk : so we went back , and we employed angelo , and he 's a local artist from vila cruzeiro , very talented guy , and he knows almost everybody there , and then we employed elias , our former landlord who invited us into his house , and he 's a master of construction .
we picked this spot in vila cruzeiro , and houses are being plastered as we speak .
and the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next .
du : so while this is happening , we are bringing this idea all over the world .
jk : so the favela was not only the place where this idea started : it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan , because these communities are informal — this was the inspiration — and in a communal effort , together with the people , you can almost work like in an orchestra , where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony .
it seemed like the person i once was began to disappear .
still , things were going well .
i think that ship has sailed , it 's too late for me .
( laughter ) and i loved game shows , fascinated with game shows .
`` i remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me , as badly as i wanted to go to school , that i was also going to miss `` '' hollywood squares '' '' and `` '' family feud . '' '' i was going to miss my game shows . ''
and you think , ah hah , knowledge really is power — the right fact deployed at exactly the right place .
but that 's what i was doing .
i was not going to say no .
but then you see the line start to go up .
`` if you can imagine computer programmers with the letters `` '' w-a-t-s-o-n '' '' written on their gut , it 's an unpleasant sight . ''
if you watch the news , you 'll see occasionally — and i see this all the time — that pharmacists now , there 's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist .
i 've heard other people say quite the opposite , that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous , something that we should worry about .
and it was friggin ' demoralizing . it was terrible .
it 's doubling every 18 months now .
this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts .
do i take this job or that one ?
if we have those facts at our mental fingertips , we 're going to be able to make informed decisions .
she was a 10-year-old girl from surrey , england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket , thailand .
but not on that beach , not on mai khao beach , because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before .
it 's not always a tsunami , often it 's a social situation .
`` you say where you 're from , and i say , `` '' oh , yeah . '' '' or your alma mater or your job , and i know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rolling . ''
you 're from fargo , north dakota . let me see what comes up .
`` oh , yeah . roger maris was from fargo . '' '' that does n't work . that 's just annoying . ''
and on the other hand , we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we 've all decided it 's not important what we know anymore , that knowledge is n't valuable because it 's all out there in the cloud , and why would we ever bother learning anything new .
thank you very much .
one thing i want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes , as they die and decompose , they actually construct an arboreal soil , both in the temperate zone and in the tropics .
what we found , however , was that they took an extremely long time — over 20 years — to regenerate , starting from the bottom and growing up .
and even now , after 25 years , they 're not up there , they have not recolonized completely .
one of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered .
`` and especially , you know , as a small brown woman in a little college , in the upper northwest part of our country , far away from the areas of power and money , i really have to ask myself , `` '' what can i do about this ? ''
the results have been fantastic .
i 'll just give you a few examples .
jodi lomask , and her wonderful troupe capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica .
we had wooden flutists , we had oboists , we had opera singers , we had guitar players , and we had rap singers .
so this whole industry is unsustainable .
what can i , as an ecologist , do about that ?
the wright brothers , in the beginning of the last century , had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly .
the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available .
they also stop passing on the virus .
first of all , the rules have changed .
this is what you see today , and this is in developing countries , so what that means is , unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now , we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis , because new drugs are developed , new drugs go to market , but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries .
it is n't only the number of drugs that are patented .
those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them , to treatment programs that need access to them .
nelson 's expectations are very high , and quite rightly so . he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next , throughout their lifetime , so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy , active lives .
they can also choose not to do that , but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century , facing forcible measures by government . so they 'd better jump now .
chris anderson : welcome to ted .
and in fact , in a way , it almost took down your empire at one point .
i had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who , at the time when you basically sold virgin records and invested heavily in virgin atlantic , and his view was that you were trading , you know , the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind .
we had — we were being attacked by british airways .
as i say , we go in and shake up other industries , and i think , you know , we do it differently and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market .
ca : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
ca : and how many employees ?
`` rb : i know , i have — the lawyers say you must n't do things like that , but — ca : i mean , speaking of which , tell us about — rb : `` '' pammy '' '' we launched , you know — mistakenly thought we could take on coca-cola , and we launched a cola bottle called `` '' the pammy '' '' and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson . ''
i mean , i think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we 've done in the past .
so in those moments , you certainly wonder what you 're doing up there or — ca : what was the closest you got to — when did you think , this is it , i might be on my way out ?
rb : well , i think the balloon adventures were — each one was , each one , actually , i think we came close .
and , i mean , first of all we — nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before , so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream , and we were n't quite sure , when a balloon actually got into the jet stream , whether it would actually survive the 200 , 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there .
ca : your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics .
rb : well , of course , the pr experts said that as an airline owner , the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats , and crashing into the seas .
( laughter ) ca : ok , this is n't exactly hardball . ok .
rb : i was dyslexic . i had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever .
ca : and some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life .
rb : she was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age .
rb : no , i think if you 're bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm .
ca : you did n't turn out too bad , i have to say , i 'm ...
your headmaster said to you — i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school — he said , you 're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison , and i 'm not sure which .
i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the u.k .
so , we put it back to vd and promptly got arrested .
`` it 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . '' '' ( laughter ) and he went , `` '' furthermore , i 'm a priest myself . '' '' and so i said , `` '' would you mind coming to the court ? '' '' and he said he 'd be delighted . and i said — and he said , `` '' would you like me to wear my dog collar ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes , definitely . please . '' '' ( laughter ) ca : that 's great . ''
how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
rb : capitalism has been proven to be a system that works .
and so we only need one , so we 're hopeful .
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of africa is important .
rb : well , first of all , on this particular situation , we 're actually — we 're working with the government on it .
i mean , thabo mbeki 's had his problems with accepting hiv and aids are related , but this is a way , i think , of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him , it 's a way of working with him , with his government .
but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .
for instance , we 're setting up clinics in africa where we 're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs , free tb treatment and free malaria treatment .
rb : well , i think that everybody — people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and i think that , you know , when i 'm on me deathbed , i will want to feel that i 've made a difference to other people 's lives .
if they had that kind of wealth and they did n't care about the world , it would be very worrying .
and i think it 's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference .
and i was thinking that your body hated it , at the time , because we are very immune to this . this is called alpha-gal epitope .
i mean , the cells in our immune system are always hungry .
and i feel now like george bush .
that 's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas , at brooks air base , with anthrax .
why did they not die ?
( applause ) mission accomplished ! ( applause )
and i found myself , after two years there and performing and learning , on the island of bali , on the edge of a crater , gunung batur .
and i was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men , a rite of passage .
`` what i would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how i work . let 's take `` '' the lion king . '' '' you saw many examples of my work up there , but it 's one that people know . ''
an ideograph is like a brush painting , a japanese brush painting .
you do n't question that .
`` the audience is willing to say , `` '' oh , i know that 's not a real sun . ''
you added silk to the bottom .
but the fact is , without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires , it 's nothing .
trinculo : misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .
antonio : here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon .
so in the theater , i started the play , it was a black sand rake , white cyc , and there was a little girl , miranda , on the horizon , building a drip castle , a sand castle .
the medium was apparent . it was banal . we saw it .
but as they started to pour the water , the light changed from showing you the black-clad stagehands to focusing , this rough magic that we do in theater , it focused right on the water itself .
`` the masked actors , the puppeteers , they disappear , and the audience makes that leap into this world , into this imaginary world of `` '' the tempest '' '' actually happening . ''
`` let 's see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano . '' '' and we climbed up and we got to the very top , and we 're on the edge , on this precipice , roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end , and i 'm up there alone on this incredible precipice . ''
i 'm in the crucible right now .
i know you understand that .
thank you .
( applause )
not all species on our planet have brains , so if we want to know what the brain is for , let 's think about why we evolved one .
so it 's really important to remember that sensory , memory and cognitive processes are all important , but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements .
i believe movement is the most important function of the brain — do n't let anyone tell you that it 's not true .
that problem is solved .
so this is the end of a ph.d. project from one of the best robotics institutes .
and the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass .
now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance .
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .
so for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
and more than that , the outside world , or task , is both ambiguous and variable .
and numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty .
there are two sources of information bayes ' rule tells you .
that information is available in the current shot , but there 's another source of information not available on the current shot , but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis , and that 's that the ball does n't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .
if you 're playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
now there 's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events .
what evidence is there for this ?
but it has n't really been shown , it 's because you have a neural simulator , simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense .
so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem .
and we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .
so the important point here is the right hand always does the same things — sinusoidal movement .
and we use this motor to apply force down to player one 's fingers for three seconds and then it stops .
i could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .
now it turns out , we are extremely stereotypical .
and perhaps in life , movements get better through learning .
here are two possible paths to that ball .
so i hope i 've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement .
you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision .
well , in america , that living in cities , for many of them , they 're living in cities still where they 're dependent on that automobile .
but i ca n't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i 've learned from the economists , the epidemiologists and the environmentalists .
and these are the neighborhoods , for example , in the central valley of california that were n't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up ; they were decimated .
portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s that began to distinguish it from almost every other american city .
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
i believe that this american healthcare crisis that we 've all heard about is an urban design crisis , and that the design of our cities lies at the cure .
if you lived in a less walkable neighborhood , you were 60 percent likely to be overweight .
american pollution does not come from factories anymore , it comes from tailpipes , and the amount that people are driving in your city , your urban vmt , is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city .
and we take car crashes for granted .
new york city .
san francisco , the same thing . portland , the same thing .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
and then the american environmental movement has been a classically arcadian movement .
we 've got the solar photovoltaic system , solar hot water heater , dual-flush toilets , bamboo floors .
yet all of these innovations — that 's what they said in the brochure .
( laughter ) all of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city .
we 've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers , and you should do the same thing , but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week .
you may have heard of it .
so sustainability , which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability .
doing so is n't easy , but it can be done , it has been done , and it 's being done now in more than a few cities , around the globe and in our country .
`` i take some solace from winston churchill , who put it this way : `` '' the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives . '' '' ( laughter ) thank you . ''
and that 's johnny depp 's famous shoulder tattoo .
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions , of course .
it somehow got me to where i am in life right now .
`` this idea is nicely captured by this quote : `` '' things without all remedy should be without regard ; what 's done is done . '' '' and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first — something we might all agree to sign onto ... ''
right , so this is lady macbeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people .
it 's also , by the way , a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage .
and in fact , the more we have of either of these things — the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret , the more acute that regret will be .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
but it turns out , when you look overall at what people regret in life , you know what , our financial decisions do n't even rank .
they account for less than three percent of our total regrets .
so if you 're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap , or company a versus company b , or should you buy the subaru or the prius , you know what , let it go .
the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .
we do n't understand that part .
now obviously , those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring .
all of us who 've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive .
and do you guys just want to see it ?
and as i said earlier , i 'm a perfectionist .
the point is n't to live without any regrets .
but security is tight at all the shops . every day there are more and more cops .
he made a left turn on houston , i pulled out my gun , and i said , ' gim me them jordans ! ' and the punk tried to run .
because i 'm an extension of my work , and if they love me , then they will love my work , and if they love my work , then they will love poetry , and if they love poetry , then i will have done my job , which is to transcend it to the world .
you know what the problem is with you , homie ?
i did n't know you actually have to have creative control .
i would wake him up at , like , 6:30 in the morning to ask him who 's the best poet .
i 'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a shakespearean sonnet , i was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me .
so what , your actors studied guerrilla theater at the london rep ?
boards do n't hit back .
i 'm a writer and a journalist , and i 'm also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , i 've learned how to do a lot of new things .
one : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
i could n't afford to find an apartment , or could n't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat .
and i refused to give them up , so i stayed in the van .
and i went . i had n't bathed in three days .
`` then the professor listened to my story and he said , `` '' you have a job . you have hope . ''
i just think that it 's our responsibility to do it better .
how many of you shoplifted , tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight — yes , even with a sibling ?
now , how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions ?
we rarely , if ever , talk about the prosecutor .
in the fall of 2009 , a young man was arrested by the boston police department .
and , ladies and gentlemen , it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us .
we recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to best buy , and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we could n't recover .
an employed christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one .
there was something really wrong with me .
i 'd been in afghanistan for a couple of months with the northern alliance as they were fighting the taliban .
i came home to new york , where i live .
i was way more scared than i had ever been in afghanistan .
the trains were going too fast .
there were too many people .
everything was too loud , everything was moving too quickly .
so i started to study this as a journalist , and i realized that there was something really strange going on .
as a result , the casualty rates have gone down .
around 10 percent of the us military is actively engaged in combat , 10 percent or under .
in fact , one study found that if you deploy to iraq or afghanistan , you 're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later .
and recently , while i was researching ptsd , i had this thought .
in other words , maybe the problem is n't them , the vets ; maybe the problem is us .
and the highest rates of depression were urban women in north america .
what 's going on with those people , the phantom 40 percent that are troubled but do n't understand why ?
and then they come home and they have to give all that up and they 're coming back to a society , a modern society , which is hard on people who were n't even in the military .
it 's just hard on everybody .
and we keep focusing on trauma , ptsd .
but a lot of them — maybe what 's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation .
that alienation and depression can lead to suicide .
no wonder they 're scared .
we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents could n't take for granted when they grew up — things like power always on in our houses , things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .
we grew up , and we grew older .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .
my marriage was n't going well , and we just were growing further and further apart .
( laughter ) and then i got excited when it started getting tens of hits , and then i started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions .
i was like , that sounds totally fake .
i love the way that they see the world , because they 're seeing the world for the first time .
and you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled .
( laughter ) and this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to canada .
`` and when my dad tells the story , he says , `` '' the craziest thing was , i 'd never seen any of that before , except bread . ''
`` he would say , `` '' look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ? ''
we 're the only ones with jewelry and democracy .
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .
and this is faster than most broadband connections these days .
and it really does n't matter where the beam hits the solar cell .
it 's not my idea , other people have hit on it , but i 've tried to take it to some new places .
i plant the potatoes , i weed the garden , i domesticate the species .
but that day , it occurred to me : what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit ?
`` but then i realized , `` '' no , this is exactly what the grasses want us to do . ''
`` i 'm a dupe . i 'm a dupe of the lawns , whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees , who they compete with for sunlight . '' '' and so by getting us to mow the lawn , we keep the trees from coming back , which in new england happens very , very quickly . ''
ugh . mini-me . ( laughter ) we have this intellectual , this darwinian revolution in which , thanks to darwin , we figured out we are just one species among many ; evolution is working on us the same way it 's working on all the others ; we are acted upon as well as acting ; we are really in the fiber , the fabric of life .
we are still cartesians — the children of descartes — who believe that subjectivity , consciousness , sets us apart ; that the world is divided into subjects and objects ; that there is nature on one side , culture on another .
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .
and i 'll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , ok ?
but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens ' favorite form of protein .
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
put that in play .
when a ruminant grazes grass , the grass is cut from this height to this height , and it immediately does something very interesting .
this is how soil is created .
td : but before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me , i was living in eastern tibet with my family .
how did that feel when they came and whisked you away , and your lifestyle completely changed ?
and what i mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
( laughter ) td : but it did n't turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as i thought it would have been .
i did n't have have many personal friends to spend time with , but i was expected to perform these prescribed duties .
when i was 14 , i escaped from tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father , my relatives , my friends and my homeland .
that 's wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
along with outward development and increase of opportunity , there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections .
but i had a really striking experience once , when a group from afghanistan came to visit me , and we had a really interesting conversation .
what we saw in the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas was the depletion of matter , some solid substance falling down and disintegrating .
td : so , with regard to the development that we 've been talking about here at this conference , i really feel that the development that we make should n't create a further burden for us as human beings , but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world .
so , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we 're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree 's very root .
i was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth , and people would ask me , why .
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
( video ) narrator : in front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now , either because they 're dead — ( laughter ) or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
there 's a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
that chin barbel is flashing .
it 's a scream for help ; it 's meant to attract attention .
so there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean — most of them that make light .
`` and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in `` '' avatar , '' '' but you do n't have to travel to pandora to see them . ''
it 's got a brittle star hitching a ride .
it 's a green saber of light .
( gasps ) i 'd be very interested in your theories about what that 's about .
it 's just 16 blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays .
so the camera 's black and white .
there 's something small there that responds .
but the cool thing is , we 're talking to it .
we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data .
so this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark .
but he 's persistent .
we need more eyes on the process .
this is something that should be on everybody 's bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
you 're going to be able to power stuff , so irrigation makes a difference .
and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it does n't apply technology that was discovered in mexico . and in fact , has n't recognized this man , to the point where there are n't statues of this man all over mexico . there are in china and india . and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india . that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies .
`` he was at hopkins when he did this , and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , `` '' i did n't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins . do you know he just won the nobel ? '' '' ( laughter ) i mean , that was mom , but anyway , this guy is just a class act . you find him at the bench every single day , working on a pipette and building stuff . and one of the things this guy just built are these things . ''
so when i decided to create an art piece in manshiyat naser , the neighborhood of the cairo garbage collectors in egypt , i never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that i would ever live .
this is where they built the st. simon monastery , a 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself .
but fast enough , those building numbers became family names .
there was doubts and difficulties , like fears and stress .
we used to take our break in front of their houses , and all the kids of the neighborhood used to join us .
`` so i asked aunty fareeda , `` '' why is that ? '' '' and she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything from somebody that they do n't know because maybe this person needs it more than they do . ''
they say , they are the ones who produce the garbage , not them .
thank you .
and so it was great fun in those days , and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .
and i think you 're starting to see that , and it 's making our job even more enjoyable .
so i thought that i would show you a few videos to show off this new , broader definition of design in products and services and environments .
and so then the object — the merchandise that you 're interested in — can be scanned . it 's taken into the dressing room , and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room .
but if you push the button , of course , the whole wall goes dark .
so you enter your information . then , like the london tube system , the little trains go around with what you 're thinking about .
and then when you get to a station , it 's expanded so that you can actually read it .
then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor — mostly teenagers coming out of there — there 's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by durrell [ bishop ] and andrew [ hirniak ] of itch .
there 's lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
he 's always been interested in technology in the future .
( sa : customizable for the boss of your choice . ) dk : and of course : a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle .
but it was intended to be quite quiet .
and then , if you saw , the panels actually rotate . so you can get the information on the front side , but as they rotate , you can see the actual recycling plant behind , with all the machines as they actually process the water .
you can see : there 's the plant .
approtec is a company started by dr. martin fisher , who 's a good friend of mine . he 's a ph.d. from stanford .
so we 're in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
and in my own practice , from product to approtec , it 's really exciting that we 're taking a more human-centered approach to design , that we 're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do , and i think this is great .
how do we bring up boys ? what does it mean to be a boy ?
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .
for me , it was the turning point of my life .
i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years .
listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled , and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically , all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them .
i 've seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
and in many places they are worth less than goats and cows .
`` and what i want to suggest is that , having talked to girls , because i just finished a new book called `` i am an emotional creature : the secret life of girls around the world , '' i 've been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that i 've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that 's been enforced on girl is the verb `` '' to please . '' '' girls are trained to please . ''
`` and she looked into her baby 's eyes and she said , `` '' of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ? ''
and she made a decision as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls .
she 's changed the rules .
and jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows .
she slept with the hyenas . she hid at night .
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .
i can tell you he wo n't call back . it 's a vibe i share .
i love that i do not take things lightly .
do n't you say all negative that it 's only only a teenage thing , or it 's only because i 'm a girl .
i am an emotional creature .
and i love , hear me , i love , love , love being a girl .
thank you very much .
could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level ?
it 's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions , because it 's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell .
in 2002 , we started a new institute , the institute for biological energy alternatives , where we set out two goals : one , to understand the impact of our technology on the environment , and how to understand the environment better , and two , to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life .
our first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage , a virus that attacks only e. coli .
and you should know that basically 99 , probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed .
so , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code .
so in the remaining information , in the watermarks , contain the names of , i think it 's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage .
and they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach — we 've briefed the white house , we 've briefed members of congress , we 've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances .
yes , in the back .
we have , at the institute , ongoing funding now from nih in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year .
or , more importantly , hiv , where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today ca n't keep up with those evolutionary changes .
we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources , make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co2 .
( laughter ) ( music ) ( beeping ) ( music ) ( laughter ) so a few of my friends were also pretty addicted to the game , and i invited them to play as well .
( video ) friend : ah !
( laughter ) ( video ) friend : what the heck ? ( laughter )
it had over two million views in just a few days .
a lot of people wanted to make it their own , or asked me how it was made .
since i did n't find anything , i decided to make something on my own .
i started with paper and fabric .
i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops .
perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects .
that 's the beauty of using everyday materials ; it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric .
only half of the children go to school , which means that people are living very badly .
bg : but i think what surprised many people is it 's not only sudden , but it was n't supposed to be sudden .
but for that , the countries at entry points need to be massively supported , and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms , distributing those that are coming into all european countries , according to the possibilities of each country .
but as the public less and less believes in european institutions , it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more europe to solve these problems .
but , unfortunately , we have a lot of people scared , just because europe was not able to do the job properly .
they have all the neighbors .
now that the world seems to have woken up , are you getting more funding and more support , or it 's still the same ?
we were much worse during the summer .
for instance , lebanon and jordan are middle-income countries .
because they are middle-income countries , they can not receive soft loans or grants from the world bank .
and , of course , if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries , it is clear that , especially their poor groups of the population , are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing .
because what you are saying — ( applause ) what you are saying will be heard by all the muslims in your own country , and it will pave the way for the recruitment and the mechanisms that , through technology , daesh and al-nusra , al-qaeda , and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies .
`` and it 's just telling them , `` '' you are right , we are against you . '' '' so obviously , this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic , multi-religious , multicultural , this is creating a situation in which , really , it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed . ''
bg : have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult ?
we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq , so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in .
and my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism .
and for me it 's a good thing that they will be like that , but i also recognize that , for that to work properly , you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies .
ag : well , look : in 2005 , we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity , because conflicts had ended .
ag : well , i do n't think i would write any message .
you know , one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver , always telling the new one what to do .
so that , i will not do .
you know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch .
it totally dominated her imagination for months .
it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand .
he was not invited to the screening . he was too young for that .
but he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted . ( laughter ) so he wandered in , and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling , and i do n't think he understands what 's going on , but he is sure soaking in it .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
and , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
`` do you remember what the critics said when `` '' brave '' '' came out ? ''
i 'd like to tell you about a legal case that i worked on involving a man named steve titus .
titus was a restaurant manager .
and one night , the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal .
`` she said , `` '' that one 's the closest . '' '' the police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial , and when steve titus was put on trial for rape , the rape victim got on the stand and said , `` '' i 'm absolutely positive that 's the man . '' '' and titus was convicted . ''
so what would you do at this point ?
so i was asked to work on titus ' case because i 'm a psychological scientist .
but decades of work in psychology has shown that this just is n't true .
i did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they remember .
the subjects in this study were members of the u.s. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it 's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war .
some patients were going into therapy with one problem — maybe they had depression , an eating disorder — and they were coming out of therapy with a different problem .
extreme memories for horrific brutalizations , sometimes in satanic rituals , sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements .
you were frightened . you were crying .
and i went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy , unpleasant litigation , but finally , finally , it was over and i could really get back to my work .
if we planted a warm , fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus , we could get people to want to eat asparagus more .
i know what i would choose for a kid of mine .
such a discovery might have saved steve titus , the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory .
in alberta people work nonstop , 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can .
and you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature , and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea .
it lost 80 percent of its ice .
i always show my pictures in the street .
but how to understand the world without the voice of people ?
just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons .
you should n't worry about me . dad does n't need to go to work .
if someday i can achieve something , i would like to say thank you daddy and mommy .
thank you for having fed me and raised me , and for making my life of today . thank you .
it 's a fantastic story of life on the earth .
i 'm very proud to show you the teaser .
today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet .
half of the world 's forests have vanished .
it is also available for school , cities , ngos and you .
it 's too late to be pessimistic — really too late .
merci beaucoup . i love you .
but after that , i decided to work on the spirit .
so this is what i looked like by the end .
because living so healthily was killing me .
i had to do that properly .
and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs .
it was like something out of caligula .
( laughter ) without the sex part .
and mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another , so sound is really critical for their lives .
and i mentioned i 'll use some visual representations of sounds .
`` it sounds sort of like `` '' tweeeeeet . '' '' like that . ''
this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer 's whistle .
many mammals have to produce contact calls when , say , a mother and calf are apart .
but all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters , they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again .
most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin .
but there are some exceptions .
and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia , lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats .
the world is mostly blue .
so we live in a world of satellite communication , are used to global communication , but it 's still amazing to me .
the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours .
they form songs , and they appear to play a role in reproduction , sort of like that of song birds .
what happened was , during the cold war , the u.s. navy had a system that was secret at the time , that they used to track russian submarines .
this shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles .
so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .
i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls .
now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they 're dispersed , imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the '70s .
over the last 50 years , as we 've put more noise into the oceans , these whales have had to shift .
now there 's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be , and there 's probably lost opportunities .
they rush as fast as they can to get to their port .
i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate .
( applause )
`` when you think of a relationship builder , do n't you just automatically think `` '' architect ? '' '' probably not . ''
there really was n't a precedent for this kind of space , so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses .
community meeting houses are places where there 's very specific relationships between people , like this one in mali , where the elders gather .
it 's almost like this three-way intersection that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation .
it 's made of cordwood masonry , which is using logs the way you would use bricks .
the shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower .
about 15 years ago in chicago , they started to replace old police stations , and they built this identical model all over the city .
you know , every city has parks , libraries , schools and other public buildings that have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors .
but reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require engaging the people who live there .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
and we crave one thing , even though we kind of do n't know it all the time .
in order to do this , it 's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and digitize it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
and , you know , it 's a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
was a beloved pianist , maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century .
and in the right speaker is going to be the original recording , and the left speaker is going to be the new recording , actually of an instrument just like that one , and i 'm going to play them together at the same time .
and when you put on headphones , and you listen to this , you 're inside of glenn gould 's body .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
i want to hear the pieces that horowitz did n't play .
the transition will be this one .
and as the president of the company , i did n't feel real comfortable about where we were .
it 's an irish jig , and i want you to hear his humor .
and they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors .
my main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone , which is an underwater microphone , and this is so i can correlate sound and behavior .
they 're born without spots , and they get spots with age , and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases , so that 's fun to track their behavior .
now the mother you see here is mugsy .
and you can really feel the sound . that was my point with that .
for example , they babysit each other 's calves .
now , it 's important to remember that you 're only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds , and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds , and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds .
now , it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes .
( dolphin noises ) she 's kind of teasing him and taunting him .
and these are artificially created whistles .
i 'm going to drop the rope , see if they come over .
i 'm going to try to request this toy , the rope toy , from the dolphins using the rope sound .
and we try to not touch the animals too much , we really do n't want to over-habituate them .
and i 'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard .
you 've got full attention .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we 're also planning to put those back into the computerized system .
likewise , we can create our own whistles , our own whistle names , and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with .
the day the war was over , i remember seeing this image — one of blocked roads , of displaced people eagerly rushing south , back to their homes , regardless of what they would find .
i saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends tattoos , in return for a set fee of five dollars .
`` and what for ? '' '' let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is . ''
when it 's dropped from the air , it opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets .
if someone steps on them by accident or picks them up , they can explode .
what drew me closer to his story was my instant realization of the difficulties mohammed was likely to face in the future — that what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury at the age of 11 , would increase manyfold .
in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields , they simply do it and risk it .
it hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a job , and he 's turned away with a small amount of money paid to him out of pity .
here is one of his messages .
on january 26 , 2013 , a band of al-qaeda militants entered the ancient city of timbuktu on the southern edge of the sahara desert .
for me , it conjures up images of passivity , of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel .
for five years , i had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and i 'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me .
the same is true with invisible writing .
that 's why i founded the lazarus project , a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever .
more subtly , though , it can recover a second story behind every object , the story of how , when and by whom a text was created , and , sometimes , what the author was thinking at the time he wrote .
the main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light .
ladies and gentlemen , that is the future of the past .
thank you very much .
( applause )
yet , it 's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
`` and so , going back to this abalone shell , besides being nanostructured , one thing that 's fascinating is , when a male and female abalone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , `` '' this is how to build an exquisite material . ''
so that 's what i would like to be able to do , convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table .
( laughter ) and you flip it over , and it 's the amino acids with the ph at which they have different charges .
and so we use a nontoxic virus called m13 bacteriophage , whose job is to infect bacteria .
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen , that can be used for clean fuels .
you can also do this with solar cells .
thank you .
my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
that was it , by the way .
she was six , and she was at the back , drawing , and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention , and in this drawing lesson , she did .
but james got the part of joseph , which we were thrilled about .
`` we had the place crammed full of agents in t-shirts : `` '' james robinson is joseph ! '' '' ( laughter ) he did n't have to speak , but you know the bit where the three kings come in ? ''
and by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
in fact , we moved from stratford to los angeles .
( laughter ) how annoying would that be ? ( laughter )
they live up there , and slightly to one side .
they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . is that right ?
is n't that true ?
one , it 's diverse .
i used to be on the board of the royal ballet , as you can see .
i think now they 'd say she had adhd . would n't you ?
she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school , founded the gillian lynne dance company , met andrew lloyd webber .
there are a few things that all of us need .
( laughter ) yeah ?
( applause ) trans people and trans issues , they 've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately .
and i should n't have to use the men 's room because i 'm not a man .
have you heard about these ?
and this starts very early .
so i told her that she was n't alone and that it was n't right what had happened to her , and then she asked me if i had ever peed in my pants before .
( laughter ) which of course was a lie , because you know how you hit , like , 42 or 43 , and sometimes you just , i do n't know , you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze , when you 're running upstairs , or you 're stretching .
`` i said , `` '' yes , until you can get home . '' '' she seemed to take some comfort in that . ''
what about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates , whose voice still has n't dropped yet ? hey ?
what about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there ?
when you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
well , what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that , after you drop your vote into the ballot box .
they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
the ballot boxes go to counting places .
so we have to trust a lot of people .
and the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
and there 's some complicated cryptography going on in there , but what 's not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
and by working with journalists , by giving all of my information back to the american people , rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication , we 've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that i think has resulted in a benefit for everyone .
and something that we 've seen , something about the prism program that 's very concerning to me is , there 's been a talking point in the u.s. government where they 've said 15 federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful , but what they do n't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that 's considered 34,000 warrant requests over 33 years , and in 33 years only rejected 11 government requests .
these are n't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate america in a free and open internet should be .
it does n't mean that there 's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the nsa palling around and making back-room deals about how they 're going to give this stuff away .
now each company handles it different ways .
they can all see it because it 's unencrypted .
es : so , i 've got to give credit to the nsa for using appropriate names on this .
what 's amazing about this , this report , that did n't get that much attention , is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee , dianne feinstein , had not seen this report until the washington post contacted her asking for comment on the report .
es : well , so the first thing is , you 're giving up your rights .
your rights matter because you never know when you 're going to need them .
we have a right to privacy .
`` it 's about a program called `` '' bullrun . '' '' can you explain what that is ? ''
and the reason that i believe they 're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure .
i say no , and all three branches of the american government say no as well .
they said , it 's not worth the risk to our economy .
i 've made clear again and again and again that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people .
you could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered america or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards america and the world 's long-term good ?
es : it is . i think it 's very true .
( applause ) tim , good to see you . come up there .
is that something that makes sense ?
es : yes , i can hear you . ca : oh , he 's back .
your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view , but you still believe there 's a way of doing something about that .
i am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win , and i think that 's something that we need to take hope from , and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world .
( applause ) ca : in the meantime , courtesy of the internet and this technology , you 're here , back in north america , not quite the u.s. , canada , in this form .
`` ( laughter ) ca : at ted , the mission is `` '' ideas worth spreading . '' '' if you could encapsulate it in a single idea , what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment ? ''
we are built out of very small stuff , and we are embedded in a very large cosmos , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales , and that 's because our brains have n't evolved to understand the world at that scale .
this is light waves , electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes .
now , presumably , every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there 's something beyond what we can sense .
instead , what we all do is we accept reality as it 's presented to us .
everything is about smell for you .
now , that might sound speculative , but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal nature in 1969 .
so a scientist named paul bach-y-rita put blind people in a modified dental chair , and he set up a video feed , and he put something in front of the camera , and then you would feel that poked into your back with a grid of solenoids .
they can come to see through their tongue .
so my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf , and this is a project i 've undertaken with a graduate student in my lab , scott novich , who is spearheading this for his thesis .
and when we look around at things like braille , for example , people are getting information through bumps on their fingers .
the key is this : our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges , but they 're really bad at what our world has become , which is screens with lots and lots of data .
so i 'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city , a little bit about detroit , and i want to do that through the voices of detroiters .
so that question is really powerful , and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment , when you connect it to the stories that some detroiters had , and actually a lot of african-americans ' families have had that are living in midwestern cities like detroit .
it was n't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before , and urban agriculture , while a very productive and successful intervention happening in detroit , was not the only answer , that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new , productive , innovative , and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities , where still nearly 300,000 residents lived .
justin bieber becoming president of the united states ?
the concern is really that we will build machines that are so much more competent than we are that the slightest divergence between their goals and our own could destroy us .
but whenever their presence seriously conflicts with one of our goals , let 's say when constructing a building like this one , we annihilate them without a qualm .
the second assumption is that we will keep going .
if only half the stories about him are half true , there 's no question he 's one of the smartest people who has ever lived .
right ? so imagine if we just built a superintelligent ai that was no smarter than your average team of researchers at stanford or mit .
so what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance ?
`` one researcher has said , `` '' worrying about ai safety is like worrying about overpopulation on mars . '' '' this is the silicon valley version of `` '' do n't worry your pretty little head about it . '' '' ( laughter ) no one seems to notice that referencing the time horizon is a total non sequitur . ''
let me say that again .
this is how long we 've had the iphone .
`` get ready . '' '' and now we 're just counting down the months until the mothership lands ? ''
now take a moment to consider that the safest and only prudent path forward , recommended , is to implant this technology directly into our brains .
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence .
not to build it , because i think we 'll inevitably do that , but to understand how to avoid an arms race and to build it in a way that is aligned with our interests .
mars is small and rocky , and though it 's a bit far from the sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like kepler .
private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on mars .
well , one possible solution to fermi 's paradox is that , as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars , they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with .
( applause )
that 's more than disliking the needle ; that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia .
and there 's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle .
and it 's a very simple device — you could call it a sophisticated finger .
now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : one is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain .
but it could be argued that the needle is holding back our immune responses ; it 's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin .
it 's off the grid entirely .
you can see immediately that we have those projections in the skin .
but you can immediately see that the nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed .
we target thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair 's width of the surface of the skin .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated , and that dashed line indicates the protection threshold .
we can push it one way , where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle .
now , of course , we 've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this , what we 've achieved with influenza .
if the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down , but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well .
but nobody suggested this one , and the reason for that was two months ago , ebola was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen , and the world was terrified , concerned and alarmed by this disease , in a way we 've not seen in recent history .
and so peter clement was charged with driving that 12-hour-long rough road from monrovia , the capital , up to lofa county , to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there .
so he sat down with the local chiefs , and he listened .
`` and he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him — they said , `` '' when our children are sick , when our children are dying , we ca n't hold them at a time when we want to be closest to them . ''
and for this reason , they were deeply disturbed , deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them .
they met right around that time , they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency joint operation center in conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped , to implement the strategies we talked about .
we saw the schools begin to close , markets no longer started , no longer functioned the way that they should in these countries .
large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas , and then riots broke out .
this is a very dangerous , debilitating , and deadly disease .
we have to have treatment centers , specialized ebola treatment centers , where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected , so that they might survive the disease .
the virus was stopped in nigeria by these four strategies and the people implementing them , obviously .
so there 's no question that these strategies actually work .
that was the big question that we were facing just two or three months ago .
what we saw , ladies and gentlemen , which was probably most impressive , was this incredible work by the governments , by the leaders in these countries , with the communities , to try to ensure people understood this disease , understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop ebola .
and these people , yes , they 're tired , but they are not fatigued .
because finishing ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus , and beginning to hunt it .
ladies and gentleman , ebola can be beaten .
it 's a somewhat more indirect way .
what can explain these huge spillover effects of education ?
and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor , michigan , and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes .
and so they 'll both underinvest because everyone 's going to move out .
well , the reality is , if you look at the data , americans are n't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume .
is that something that you are still invested in , that you still believe in the notion of investment ?
in 1962 , buckminster fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope .
this is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in may .
and the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case .
so i 'd love to talk to you all , and invite you to come down and take a closer look .
and it actually even looks a little bit like lace .
even her shoes are printed .
imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements .
( applause ) [ thank you ] ( applause )
the picture i made that day ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits .
my first date was colin .
`` i asked carl , `` '' what 's the first thing you notice about a woman ? '' '' he said , `` '' tits . '' '' ( laughter ) matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves . ''
austin and mike came together .
i did n't think he liked me at all , but at the end of the night , he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates .
he was 18 , she was 15 .
nevertheless , they were married soon after .
he was there alone drinking and she was with friends .
amazingly , mary took him back , and eventually things got better .
as : they all had this beautiful quality of endurance , but that was true of the singles , too .
my favorite pictures on this trip were of joe and roseanne .
now , by the time we met joe and roseanne , we 'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph .
excuses .
yes , there is .
`` the word is `` '' hail , '' '' and it has a great definition as well . ''
but also , if you 're really wishing somebody well , it 's very hard to judge them at the same time .
you hear the difference ?
it 's the way your voice feels .
( higher pitch ) where did you leave my keys ?
one more time .
this is a serious point here .
this is where we are now , right ?
there was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
many of these do-it-yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century .
we would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do-it-yourself information on smart materials .
but that 's not always the case .
he used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker .
her project 's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder .
so hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative .
back then , computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home .
so we started looking around for new , innovative teaching methods , but what we found was quite disappointing .
why not build a virtual laboratory simulator ?
`` and what i love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards , all surprised and a little confused , and say , `` '' i just spent two hours in this virtual lab , and ... and i did n't check facebook . '' '' ( laughter ) that 's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students . ''
and what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods .
basically , i take my mobile phone — most students already have these , smartphones — and i plug it into this virtual-reality headset , a low-cost headset .
do you see me up on the screen ?
michael bodekaer : great ! awesome .
she is my teacher — my lab assistant — and what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory .
i see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
consider this : like the prophets , all the superheroes are missing parents .
superman 's parents die on krypton before the age of one .
bruce wayne , who becomes batman , loses his parents at the age of six in gotham city .
this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the 99 .
the 99 references the 99 attributes of allah in the koran , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so the librarians find out and they get together a special solution , a chemical solution called king 's water , that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books .
the books and the solution get thrown in the tigris river .
the first is the fall of granada , the last muslim enclave in europe .
noor is arabic for light .
so these 99 stones , a few kind of rules in the game : number one , you do n't choose the stone ; the stone chooses you .
and the last point about the 99 noor stones is this .
i think that 's there in all cultures , right ?
so al-batina is hidden , but she 's a superhero .
so from day one , the people involved in the project , bottom left is fabian nicieza , writer for x-men and power rangers .
top right is stuart moore , a writer for iron man .
`` he said , `` '' naif , islam and cartoon ? ''
what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy .
dana : there 's too much darkness .
i ca n't forget auntie .
i believe in you .
do n't we deserve to be saved ? do n't i ?
jabbar : we 're here to help you .
now , i 'm a clinical psychologist . i 'm licensed in new york state .
and i took away the name of the writer , the name of the [ unclear ] — everything was gone except the facts .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban valentine 's day . red was made illegal .
the second one took place in upstate new york .
it 's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme .
this is one of my sons , rayan , who 's a scooby doo addict .
`` last summer when we were in our home in new york , he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse . and i was in my office working , and he came in , `` '' baba , i want you to come with me . i want my toy . '' '' `` `` yes , rayan , just go away . '' '' he left his scooby doo in his house . ''
`` i have work to do . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level . ( laughter ) ''
as an undergrad at tufts university , we were giving away free falafel one day and , you know , it was middle east day or something .
in a world like that , they 'll always be a job for superman and the 99 .
to ruminate means to chew over .
and he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy .
if they felt better about themselves and more empowered ?
it appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers .
( laughter ) and knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job , which is that of a psychoanalyst .
now , choices are anxiety-provoking .
now , in regard to the current economic crisis , we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before , and no political or social changes are needed .
let 's say when we are facing a life-threatening illness , a lot of people do n't want to know that .
now for me , a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning ?
why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices , that we do n't accept losses and risks ?
quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality .
we can choose to have different rating agencies .
i did have a choice , such as nations , as people , we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and i 've learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
`` and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : `` '' terminator , '' '' `` '' aliens '' '' and `` '' the abyss . '' '' and with `` '' the abyss , '' '' i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking . ''
you know , it 's arthur clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
they were seeing something magical .
( applause ) now , that blew my mind .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you ca n't get back by yourself .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they did n't have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals — they 're basically aliens right here on earth .
i did n't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions .
you 're doing it for the task itself , for the challenge — and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is — for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
`` other people will do that for you — do n't do it to yourself , do n't bet against yourself , and take risks . '' '' nasa has this phrase that they like : `` failure is not an option . '' ''
`` you know , the security environment in somalia at that moment in time — and nothing has really changed too much — can best be described as `` '' mad max '' '' by way of `` '' a clockwork orange . '' '' and i remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival , i went up to a feeding clinic . ''
this tells us that most of the people who are dying in war are living in poor countries , and yet most of the people who are profiting from war are living in rich countries — people like you and me .
let 's take a look at that assumption for just one moment , because you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade since the start of the war on terror .
but know that how you give is just as important as how much you give .
but i can tell you that i know what it means now .
he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
i bring you into a room .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
i want to talk today only about autonomy .
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when i was a child .
`` i do n't know what it is . i get asked in interviews a lot , `` my god , you 're guitars are so gigantic ! '' ''
so every year , june 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
and i was very young then . i think i was 11 years , and i started asking questions , and that’s when my political education started .
`` i 've got a bowl full of boiling water — the first one who comes in here , gets it . '' '' and they left . ''
so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life .
and they were n't used to that .
`` but i took them outside one day and i said , `` i want you to estimate the height of the building . '' ''
he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village .
and if africa is going to get fixed , it 's by them , not by us .
well , i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question .
it may be that we live in an endless universe , both in space and in time .
and there 've been bangs in the past , and there will be bangs in the future .
we need to make the best mathematical models we can , the most consistent ones .
and gradually , we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world .
my parents were both elected to the first parliament , alongside nelson and winnie mandela . they were the only other couple .
and while i was busy working — i was working on these colliding worlds , in the day .
so i had an idea . and the idea was very simple .
and let 's recruit students from the whole of africa , bring them together with lecturers from all over the world , and we 'll try to give them a fantastic education .
it 's very , very interesting what 's happening .
the other thing that 's happened , which was good for us , is the internet .
well , we designed aims as a 24-hour learning environment , and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning .
no droning on at the chalkboard .
lectures , problem-solving and so on . it 's an extraordinary place .
they 'll do well . they 'll have successful careers .
and where they are is indicated over here .
and i 'll just show you one .
i have a bachelor of science with an education degree .
neil turok : so tendai came to aims and did very well .
he 's about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
and she 's now at aims . ( applause ) so now let me get to our ted wish .
we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
so , just in ending , let me say the only people who can fix africa are talented young africans .
by unlocking and nurturing their creative potential , we can create a step change in africa 's future .
and in this particular case , this is the climax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
and , i guess somebody thought they needed to do that .
`` so what i got from him is , he turned to me and said , `` '' you would never , ever design a rocket like that . ''
`` you would never , ever design a rocket like that . '' '' and he was looking at me . it 's like , yeah , i do n't know if you noticed , but i 'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america 's finest moments with fire extinguishers . ''
so he basically set up , or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief , because what he photographed was the real thing , a mir sub going down , or actually two mir subs going down to the real wreck , and he created this very haunting footage .
it 's really beautiful , and it conjures up all these various different emotions , but he could n't photograph everything , and to tell the story , i had to fill in the gaps , which is now rather daunting , because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had , i 'm the only one who could really blow it at that point .
so i 'm going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and i 'll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
so here 's the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
so basically , if there 's two subs in the same shot , i shot it , because where 's the camera coming from ?
i 'll give it to jim , because he could use the pat on the back .
`` so i was kind of proud of it , and i went to a friend of mine , and said , `` '' you know , this is , you know , kind of the best-reviewed shot i 've ever worked on . ''
i am so excited to be here .
and ted talks — ted talks are where everybody has great ideas .
( laughter ) i 'm exactly as fit as i was when i — ( laughter ) ( applause ) i could n't run then . i 'm certainly not going to do it now . ( laughter )
we 'd have three basic rules , ok ?
and i promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when i was terrified by what i had done .
`` the friend said to my son , `` '' what 's it like having two mums ? '' '' i was a little anxious to hear , so i leant in to hear and my son said , `` '' it 's fantastic , because if one of them 's sick , you 've still got another one to cook for you . '' '' ( laughter ) so my activation button for gay equality was pressed , and along with many , many others , i campaigned for years for gay rights , and in particular , the right to marry the person that i love . ''
the hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people .
love triumphs .
`` law changed . '' '' and i — ( applause ) and i genuinely thought my activation days were over , ok ? ''
top 100 companies : how many women running them ?
seven . ok. seven . that 's all right , i suppose .
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
pretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives .
here 's quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s .
and almost instantly , we agreed on certain fundamental things .
( laughter ) and we wanted to change how politics is conducted .
`` to say , `` '' stop the bickering , let 's get the work done . '' '' we could literally change the world . ''
and this group was no different .
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
these women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes .
( applause )
i 'm sure many of you are familiar with google glass .
and i 've been on the receiving end of that , and it does n't feel very good .
fans want that experience .
fans want to be on that field .
ck : so that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life .
what do you think that fan 's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an adrian peterson bursting through the line , shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm before sprinting in for a touchdown ? what do you think that fan 's experience
but augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook .
augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game .
it 's also for jocks . who knew ?
all of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know , blind side linebacker is blitzing in .
augmented reality will be a part of sports , because it 's too profitable not to .
( applause )
this is birhan , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
what i think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves .
there is a story about olof palme , the swedish prime minister , going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s .
`` before he arrived ronald reagan said — and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister — `` isn’t this man a communist ? '' ''
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years .
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
this is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doctors ; it has 200 nurses ; it has 120 midwives .
how did he die ?
`` last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death : `` do n't worry . the united nations are coming . '' ''
it 's true .
so i said yes to this proposition .
why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
but what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure , that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model .
so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?
but mathematicians formalize this in a particular way .
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it 's called a geodesic .
`` so we ask the question again , `` '' how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? '' '' does someone want to guess ? ''
infinity . you all got it right . exactly .
but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a flat surface .
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered euclidean space .
`` and someone that comes along and says , `` '' look here 's a ball . '' '' and you go , `` '' ah ! i can see it . i can feel it . ''
( applause ) and you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces .
so there is this direct line between feminine handicraft , euclid and general relativity .
i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .
there is the totality of all the people who have come to it .
beyond the physical hardships , roughly one-third of cancer survivors here in the us will go into debt from treatment .
having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are affordable , noninvasive and could provide results much sooner , would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer .
because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell , and contain a sample of its environment , they provide a genetic snapshot of that cell 's health and its origin .
in addition to their recent emergence , another factor that 's limiting their widespread adoption is that currently , no automated exosome isolation system exists to make regular screening economically accessible .
`` and in the spirit of the hoover dream , `` a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage , '' we 're developing a technology that could ultimately place an early-warning cancer detection system in every home . ''
thank you .
on march 10 , 2011 , i was in cambridge at the mit media lab meeting with faculty , students and staff , and we were trying to figure out whether i should be the next director .
we have an app that shows you most of the radiation in japan and other parts of the world .
it was n't luck , and it was n't because it was us .
so at the media lab , we do n't just do hardware .
`` i 'm officially saying , `` '' deploy or die . '' '' you have to get the stuff into the real world for it to really count , and sometimes it will be large companies , and nicholas can talk about satellites . ''
it kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days .
now you can do it on a desktop like this , and kids can do this in dorm rooms .
in this lab , we will have the world 's capacity of gene printing within a year , 200 million base pairs a year .
`` so i do n't like the word `` '' futurist . '' '' i think we should be now-ists , like we are right now . ''
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
`` and you 'll see why 1984 wo n't be like `` '' 1984 . '' '' rebecca mackinnon : so the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today . ''
technology created by innovative companies will set us all free .
his app was n't reinstated until he won the pulitzer prize .
so here 's the thing .
or they 're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed .
or they 're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .
but there 's been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem .
in fact , in the united states , whatever you may think of julian assange , even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks .
but if you look at china , vietnam and a number of the former soviet states , what 's happening there is more troubling .
but that 's only half of the story .
and earlier this year , there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at yandex money .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
we also are going to need political innovation .
and what does that look like ?
( laughter ) now , cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology .
now , fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours .
there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super-critical for sight .
`` that means `` '' big sickness '' '' in malagasy , for how sick we got trying to collect this species . ''
now , believe it or not , swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop is n't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life , but yolo .
he could tell a story about an event , and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment .
and i know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very , very big impact on my late father .
and i have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task .
it could n't be further from the truth for me .
and then , after a year of training , i felt ready .
and it was — the paradox is that you 're in freezing cold water , but actually you 're on fire .
and i remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock , because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages .
and they were swollen so much , i could n't even close them .
and i remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers .
for those of you who do n't know him , he 's the great british explorer .
a number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the north pole .
and i realize the reason why you 're going to do this .
this is such an important swim .
and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
`` and i said to myself , `` '' lewis , do n't look left , do n't look right . ''
everything just looks so gray around here , and looks so cold .
it was absolutely magical .
we 're finally at the north pole . this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here , years of training and planning and preparation .
lewis pugh : ten seconds to swim . ten seconds to swim .
take the goggles off . take the goggles off !
`` and people ask me , `` '' lewis , what can we do about climate change ? '' '' and i say to them , i think we need to do three things . ''
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .
( applause )
and also , i could understand my afghan mother , my pakistani father , not so religious but laid-back , fairly liberal .
he did n't know anything about sports — bless him — so it was music .
some men in my parent 's community felt that it was unacceptable and dishonorable for a woman to be involved in music and to be so present in the media .
the death threats were endless .
he said music is un-islamic and the job of whores , and if you keep this up , you are going to be raped and your stomach will be cut out so that another whore like you will not be born .
different place , but unfortunately the same old story .
i 'd had enough .
but i decided that what i wanted to do is spend the next however many years of my life supporting young people and to try to be there in some small way , whatever way that i could .
i started volunteering for various organizations that were working with young muslims inside of europe .
maybe there are more of my people out there .
even in the freest societies in the world , we 're not free .
so i decided that i wanted to put my childhood superpower to some use by trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand what it 's like to be a young person stuck between your family and your country .
she was beaten so badly her ears would bleed , and when she finally left and she found a young man that she chose and she fell in love with , the community and the family found out and she disappeared .
she was found three months later .
she 'd been stuffed into a suitcase and buried underneath the house .
when their own families betray them , they look to the rest of us , and when we do n't understand , we lose them .
men that i 've been afraid of most of my life .
this is what they 're doing for our young people .
in fact , i found something , to my horror , that i recognized .
i stopped feeling like i had to pick a side , but this took me many , many years .
the thing is we can not afford to give up on each other or on our kids , even if they 've given up on us .
we are all in this together .
these two little girls with their superpowers are showing the way forward towards a society that we need to build together , a society that includes and supports , rather than rejects our kids .
this is what we run at the office , that actually runs real time .
but here you can see around the world how people are using google .
so this is a query that we had — i guess it 's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others .
okay , not very many people know about it .
that 's how we churn those products out .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here — though , by the way , search-wise , it 's only about 30 percent of our traffic — but it 's already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
so it 's a fun little project .
but it 's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes .
and — well , i 'll leave you in suspense .
`` and sergey mentioned orkut , which is something that , you know , orkut wanted to do in his time , and we call this — at google , we 've embodied this as `` '' the 20 percent time , '' '' and the idea is , for 20 percent of your time , if you 're working at google , you can do what you think is the best thing to do . ''
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as orkut and also google news .
and then , besides just looking cute on a baby 's bottom , we made it a googlette , which is basically a small project at google .
and we would n't really be sure if it 's going to work or not .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
and we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them — and these are kind of made up .
and so that 's basically what we 've done since we instituted that a few years ago , and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized .
so this is a new — how many of you use the google toolbar ?
`` but if you go to our site and search for `` '' deskbar , '' '' you 'll get this . ''
but all of these — well , these were all sort of innovative things that we did that — you know , we try many , many different things in our company .
in the early days , we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand , you know , because , you know , you 'd never want to change your logo .
and so i just wanted to give a funny example of this .
he was just kind of writing about his life .
`` why do n't they like my blog ? '' '' and so then we read his blog , which was getting — you know , sort of going from bad to worse , and we said the related search was , `` '' retards . '' '' and then , you know , he got even more mad , and he wrote — like , started swearing and so on . ''
so we do n't have to worry about our products being sold , for example , for less money in places that are poor , and then they get re-imported into the u.s. — for example , with the drug industry .
and i think we 're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search , and i think that 's a tremendous , tremendous benefit .
we accept payment for advertising , and we mark it as such .
probably none . i think we 're all darwinians .
what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
what goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass ?
most people have .
`` yesterday , amory lovins spoke about `` '' infectious repititis . '' '' it was a term of abuse , in effect . ''
`` it 's `` '' infectious repetitis , '' '' and we might as well try to have a theory of what 's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection . ''
so , this is mine .
`` most of us — now that the `` '' me decade '' '' is well in the past — now we actually do this . ''
and no other species does anything at all like it .
`` richard dawkins , whom you 'll be hearing later in the day , invented the term `` '' memes , '' '' and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book `` '' the selfish gene . '' '' now here am i talking about his idea . ''
well , you see , it 's not his . yes — he started it .
but it 's everybody 's idea now .
but it is a problem .
they 're made of information , and can be carried in any physical medium .
`` sometimes when people say , `` '' do memes exist ? '' '' i say , `` '' well , do words exist ? are they in your ontology ? '' '' if they are , words are memes that can be pronounced . ''
they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets were n't there .
and they could keep it going .
but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
they are wiping out languages .
that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
i have a story , a story that i would like to share with you .
and it 's an african story .
there was hollywood .
the industry is 15 years old .
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because i think there is a connection .
so when i proposed the story , i really had all the support to make this film .
we 're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .
`` they can afford to watch their `` '' robocop '' '' and whatever . ''
mahmood ali balogun : i think filmmaking in nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking — what they do to make a living .
bond emeruwa : so while we 're entertaining , we should be able to educate .
you see the person live .
but then when i discovered the situation in my country , at that time there was so much corruption .
kbi : i 'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it wo n't affect my face — the explosion , you know .
but always with a smile , always with an enthusiasm , that is incredible .
the nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like .
nothing .
but we 're telling it our own way , our own nigerian way , african way .
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
ca : 2,000 films a year ?
so imagine 45 films per week .
it transformed .
in 2009 , i moved to mexico and started by casting local fisherman .
so why exhibit my work in the ocean ?
it 's simply too massive , too vast , too endless .
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
so i started writing a song about having stage fright .
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease .
♫ my vocal cords movin ' , ♫ ♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound . ♫ ( applause )
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it — kind of like an old shoe .
so if there are genes like that , then you can imagine that , if you could change one of the genes in an experiment , an aging gene , maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan .
and we did n't study any of these animals .
and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
but everything else is just lying there .
this is what 's really cool : it 's aging more slowly .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
so what is the daf-2 gene ?
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
now you 've all heard of at least insulin .
and it 's looking like that 's the case .
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations — that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age-related disease ?
so it 's really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they 're still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
the receptor is n't working as well .
under those conditions , the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus — that little compartment there in the middle of the cell — and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it .
that 's how it works . that 's why we do n't see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
and that 's why we think the animals live longer .
and then suddenly , he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane .
we all have foxo genes , but we do n't all have exactly the same form of the foxo gene .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
so this is really exciting to me .
and mutations that damage the tor gene — just like the daf-2 mutations — extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice .
so this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer .
so i 'm really optimistic , and i think it wo n't be too long , i hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true .
there is n't the technology to do that .
and they 've been tagged , and they 've been found to be 70 years old .
it 's not clear .
`` you notice that you 're getting old , and you look at your human and you think , `` '' why is n't this human getting old ? '' '' they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan . ''
here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in .
that 's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient 's on the table .
`` please go cut that piece out . '' '' so we go back and we do that again , and again . ''
`` and this whole process : `` '' okay you 're done . ''
the first one is a polyanionic segment , which basically acts as a non-stick backing like the back of a sticker .
so here in this situation , if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye , which is shown in green , and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer , normal tissue ca n't cut it .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
that you can , not only see the margins right there on a molecular level , but you can see it even if it 's not right on the top — even if it 's beyond your field of view .
and then if that node has cancer , the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection .
some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others .
but equally important is to preserve things that are important for function .
but you know what , these little nerves are so small , in the context of prostate cancer , that they are actually never seen .
we 're trying to preserve nerves ; we ca n't see where they are .
what 's the problem ?
`` we have n't had that many complications . '' '' but i went ahead anyway . ''
and roger helped me .
and he brought his whole team with him .
and when we made a solution of this , tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse , their nerves literally glowed .
we have been able to see nerves for facial expression , for facial movement , for breathing — every single nerve — nerves for urinary function around the prostate .
now you do .
that white portion there is easy to see .
the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients .
understandably , the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs , such as long-term daily medications .
picture yourself driving down a small road in africa , and as you drive along , you look off to the side , and this is what you see : you see a field of graves .
`` and you go into the town , and you inquire , `` '' what 's going on here ? '' '' and people are initially reluctant to tell you . ''
`` and then someone says , `` these are the recent aids deaths in our community . '' ''
and i 'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv-positive mothers .
it 's an entire package of services , and it works .
well , back in 2001 , when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug , a nurse , in the course of her few minutes with a patient , would have to counsel for the hiv test , perform the hiv test , explain the results , dispense a single dose of the drug , nevirapine , explain how to take it , discuss infant feeding options , reinforce infant feeding , and test the baby — in minutes .
and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes .
have a seat . you 're safe here .
and so the father and the mother , together , go through the counseling and the testing .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
how do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there has n't been disclosure ?
if we can change the way households believe and think , we can change the way communities believe and think .
we have the medicines , we have the tests , but how do you reduce the stigma ?
so , a couple years ago , one of the mentor mothers came back , and she told me a story .
`` and then her oldest brother stood up and said , `` '' i too have something to tell you . ''
i 'm hiv-positive .
`` i tell them , `` '' you are going to make it , and you will raise a healthy baby . '' '' i am proof that there is hope . ''
and it is a crisis in health care systems .
task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it .
so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission .
the care does n't stop when the baby 's born — we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby , ensuring that they live healthy , successful lives .
they become leaders within their communities .
our health care systems are broken .
it was at that point , just the spark of an idea .
how many of you have checked your email today ?
how about this week ?
harriet 's paying attention to her energy use , and she is decidedly not an energy geek .
this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention .
in fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
another group got an environmental message .
and harnessed correctly , it can be a powerful force for good .
in fact , it already is .
we started with paper , we moved to a mobile application , web , and now even a controllable thermostat , and for the last five years we 've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world .
it was then that her eyes lit up .
( applause )
and that 's changed irrevocably .
we 're reacting to the audience , and we 're actually relying on them .
and in photos , instagram , 58 photos are uploaded to instagram a second .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were new york food bloggers .
so this one was n't a debunk , it was actually something that they could prove .
and you were , instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader , you were holding back the stuff that was potentially damaging .
and you have to do that investigative work .
( rain and wind sounds ) ( explosion ) oh , shit !
the first one was called spokeo , which allowed us to look for rita krills .
so if you look in the video , there 's the big umbrella , there 's a white lilo in the pool , there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool , and there 's two trees in the background .
we looked through the video for other clues .
i can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs , going into management ai n't no success story . it 's a failure .
we hear about pre-hypertension , we hear about pre-dementia , we hear about pre-anxiety , and i 'm pretty sure that i diagnosed myself with that in the green room .
in baseball , the game follows the pre-game .
season follows the pre-season .
it 's called pre-death .
but the problem is , we have a system that is completely — basically promoted this .
but everyone is responsible .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
i was born in 1976 .
i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
but we wo n't be able to take care of any of those things if we do n't solve the real problem we have in mexico first .
and now of the zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
we 're very afraid .
this vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death — even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
we need to confront this fear .
this shows that society is desperate and it 's taking the law into its own hands .
if i 'm violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico .
two years ago , in galena city , chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , eric le barón .
in the end , benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
so what did they do ?
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year .
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
i think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a mexican is to insult their mother .
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action .
this is a call for every true mexican to join this initiative . this is a call
we 're facing a very powerful opponent .
the battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
the customer , you see , is king .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while , i 've been a model .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
i am on this stage because i am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry , we call that a sexy girl .
so i tried .
you just have to read the article until you find something you do n't know , and preferably something your dad does n't even know .
( laughter ) and the link to aphrodisiac .
there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac .
so those of you who only eat your chocolate , you might have to experiment .
sympathetic magic is imitation .
the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind .
`` now that 's embarrassing , because up until now , every time i 've said , `` '' i know it like the back of my hand , '' '' i 've really been saying , `` '' i 'm totally familiar with that , i just do n't know it 's freaking name , right ? '' '' and the link i clicked on here , well , lemurs , monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar . ''
`` pan troglodytes , the name we give him , means `` '' cave dweller . '' '' he does n't . ''
he lives in rainforests and savannas .
in between those two landmarks in ham 's life , he flew into space .
years later , the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space , the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet .
chimborazo !
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated .
underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things , they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real — all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does .
we started with two schools .
and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us .
thank you very much .
i saw this in the early days working with my cousins .
but when they were a bit older , they took a little agency and decided to engage .
they found resources like khan academy and they were able to fill in those gaps and master those concepts , and that reinforced their mindset that it was n't fixed ; that they actually were capable of learning mathematics .
and then i start to disengage .
great , that 's a d-plus .
we were artificially constraining how long we had to something , pretty much ensuring a variable outcome , and we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps , but then we built right on top of it .
now , a lot of skeptics might say , well , hey , this is all great , philosophically , this whole idea of mastery-based learning and its connection to mindset , students taking agency over their learning .
it makes a lot of sense , but it seems impractical .
to actually do it , every student would be on their own track .
we have the tools to do it .
one , the students can actually master the concepts , but they 're also building their growth mindset , they 're building grit , perseverance , they 're taking agency over their learning .
and therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage .
in particular , it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another .
that is not just an abstract proposition .
now , of course , we know what it is : it 's the wikipedia .
now what 's special about the wikipedia is not its distribution .
the wikipedia , of course , is an encyclopedia created by its users .
now , in the days when mapping a genome cost millions , or even tens of thousands , it was basically a research enterprise .
you go the doctor with a cold , and if he or she has n't done it already , the first thing they do is map your genome , at which point what they 're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you , but they 're starting from your particular genome .
fabulous , lots of people talk about this .
why is that happening ?
we need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously .
they drive us into a completely new world .
thank you .
one redeeming feature is it 's lifted up off the ground and it 's got this void , and it 's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style .
well there 's always the hole .
and the question is , if one inhabits that space , what is the material of the mall ?
( video ) so this is the big idea .
`` it was dubbed `` '' the bubble '' '' by the press . ''
it 's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction .
the membrane is translucent .
so it 's down the hierarchy on lighting .
this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install .
there are extreme pressures .
form and content are together here .
the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity .
thank you .
i could n't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .
maybe there 's a little change i can get involved in .
there was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together — that we 're in this together , and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated , then that might be the key to humanity 's survival .
that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces — if we did it just for a day .
it poisoned his blood . he died when i was 11 .
and then dr. oscar arias came forward .
well not thousands — hundreds of people , lots of people — all the press , because we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day , a peace day .
for me , it was really about the process .
and here you see people like mary robinson , i went to see in geneva .
and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone .
and working with ngos and building this case .
and this young child who 'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic , and that young boy who was a child soldier , who told me he 'd killed people — he was about 12 — these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop .
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly , with 54 co-sponsors , the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day , the 21st of september , as a fixed calendar date , and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .
`` and now i was thinking , `` '' well , the press it really going to hear this story . '' '' and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day . ''
`` and i remember thinking , `` '' this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder . ''
it 's not going to work ; you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan ; the taliban wo n't listen , etc. , etc .
`` and unicef , god bless them , they said , `` '' okay , we 'll have a go . '' '' and then unama became involved in afghanistan . ''
certainly many advances , many lives saved .
but we have a major shortage of organs .
this is actually a very stunning statistic .
at the time of injury or disease , the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body .
this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge .
this was an injured urethra on the left side .
turns out your body can regenerate , but only for small distances .
then we can start to use cells .
to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .
we want to make sure that we condition this muscle , so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient .
you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
this is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain .
when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient .
for solid organs , they 're more complex because you 're using a lot more cells per centimeter .
now you can see it start . we 're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver .
this is still experimental . but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure , experimentally .
for the kidney , as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw , the first slide i showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 percent .
we can take cells from you , create the structure , put it right back into you , they will not reject .
so , we prefer organ-specific cells .
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .
this is how to stop a runaway stage .
( laughter ) i 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny . ( laughter )
and what i mean by that is that anytime we 've launched one of these technologies to the clinic , we 've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients .
are you ready to place this in your own loved one , your own child , your own family member , and then we proceed .
i 'm going to show a clip of one young lady .
and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila .
these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin — the global supply chains , which bring us our favorite brand name products .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
they 're failed states .
this is an independent republic , probably a failed state .
it 's definitely not a democratic state .
this is offshore .
we need a different machine .
so what we 've been able to do is we 've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain , that of the multinational company , and get them to do the right thing , get them to use that power for good , to deliver the key public goods .
but they are extremely efficient organizations .
you need a safe space .
the problem is the lack of trust , the lack of confidence , the lack of partnership between ngos , campaign groups , civil society organizations and multinational companies .
that governments have dropped this ball and i ca n't get used to the idea that somehow we ca n't get them to do their jobs .
so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure .
the private actors , companies and ngos , are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face .
could the private sector and ngos get together and marshal a response ?
`` `` '' you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain . ''
thank you very much .
that 's called a profit .
this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
and whale oil lit practically every building .
they 're not going to export your uncle 's buick .
that seems to make more sense .
the more we keep on using the oil , particularly the imported oil , the more we face a very obvious array of problems .
in the process , we will gain about a million good jobs , mainly rural .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
well , saving that fuel , 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon .
then you can go even further , almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements , double the big haulers ' margins .
and it 's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels .
and the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that — well , then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car , and it would cost a lot more to make , because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium .
and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .
but if this mclaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
and the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel .
they snap together like a kid 's toy .
there is a huge amount of gas to be saved , about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price .
or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance , or if we used it as hydrogen , which is more profitable and efficient , we 'd get rid of the domestic oil too .
this expands choice rapidly in the market , and actually makes more money for automakers as well .
so this is a huge social win , too .
the same for gps .
but here 's how the whole thing fits together .
and if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there , we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s .
and specifically , i 'm interested in collecting my own stories , stories from the internet , and then recently , stories from life , which is kind of a new area of work that i 've been doing recently .
so i 'll be talking about each of those today .
this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago .
so , around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university , and i noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts , not just from street corners , but also from the internet .
blog posts , photographs , thoughts , feelings , opinions , all of these things were being expressed by people online , and leaving behind trails .
`` `` '' i feel fine with the body i 'm in , there 'll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend , '' '' from a twenty-two-year-old in japan . ''
and when that happens , these montage compositions are automatically created , which consist of the sentence and images being combined .
weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent . so the sunny ones swirl around , the cloudy ones float along , the rainy ones fall down , and the snowy ones flutter to the ground .
so these are some newer projects that actually are n't even launched publicly yet .
but if you think about real life , it 's not like that at all .
so , how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story ?
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
and any of these can be clicked , and then the narrative is entered at that position .
`` so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in `` '' the whale hunt '' '' and the two whales that were killed down here . ''
and you can see rony cutting up the whale here .
and i was doing a project there about happiness , interviewing a lot of local people .
and it leads to just a completely different value system .
so , i did a number of things . i asked people a number of set questions , and took a number of set photographs , and interviewed them with audio , and also took pictures .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons , and some really sad soul holding one balloon .
( laughter ) and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life , what makes them happy .
his wish was to become a police officer .
she wanted to keep farming until she dies .
i saw this guy on the side of the road , and he actually does n't have a home .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
woman : ah , because you know , it 's impermanent .
it 's not too big — about the size of a golf ball .
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
`` people will say to you , `` you look great . have you had any work done ? '' ''
your life will have new meaning .
peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
is there a waiting list ?
moving on to something a bit larger , this is an x-ray of a bus .
( laughter ) quite a difficult brief , make a pair of men 's pants look beautiful .
and i show things for really what they are , what they 're made of .
the design comes from within .
here i was fumbling around in the ladies ' underwear department of a department store , almost got escorted from the premises .
an amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional .
so , i 'm using quite a lot of radiation .
in fact , that is three months solid x-raying .
and i sent them back an x-ray .
the most difficult things to x-ray , the most technically challenging things to x-ray are the lightest things , the most delicate things .
( music ) the bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine , which is used on the borders between countries , looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .
the lorry goes in front of it . and it takes slices of x-rays through the lorry .
and that 's how this was done . it 's actually slice , slice .
( music ) i have very high-tech equipment of gloves , scissors and a bucket . ( music )
this is a commercial application of my most recent work .
and then , so you can get in the driver 's side , sit down , and up against you is a wall .
and i 'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life .
`` we called her legadema , which means , `` '' light from the sky . '' '' dj : now we 've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals , in particular in the cats . ''
`` this particular one is called eetwidomayloh , `` he who greets with fire , '' and you can just see that about him , you know — that 's his character . ''
and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana .
yes , it is swamp . we live in the swamp in a tent , but i must tell you , every day is exhilarating .
but we 've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others , and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water .
well then we hit a deep depression , and we seriously submerged the vehicle .
he 's focused on this hyena , and he is going to get it .
and i do believe you should stay with us .
these are precious to us , these divides .
and the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make — a hiss and a sound .
( laughter ) but really and truly , this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hunting .
bj : and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000 .
south africa just released some lion bones onto the market .
that is , if we do n't take action and do something , these plains will be completely devoid of big cats , and then , in turn , everything else will disappear .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue that .
and i turned to the web to see if there might be some clues .
and it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking .
we know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage , particularly for attack , but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target , and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack .
but nevertheless , we started the testing process in january of this year , initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks .
now that exact same shark had engaged , or encountered this sams rig , which is the elude sams rig , about eight minutes before , and spent six minutes circling it , hunting for it , looking for what it could smell and sense but not see , and this was the final engagement .
( applause ) so , it 's important for us that all the testing is done independently , and the university of w.a . is doing the testing .
( applause ) and eduardo . ( applause )
i would love to share with you a story .
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around .
they realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they 've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls .
and for the most part , the stories are recycled .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one 's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .
it 's not only cold , but very dry .
particularly , there 's a place called europa , which is — europa is one of the moons of jupiter , where we see a very level ice surface , which looks as if it 's floating on top of an ocean .
but that 's hard to do . unfortunately , the ice is thick .
that 's something we do n't yet know how to do .
you 'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which , in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud — these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the sun . mostly , they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system , but they are biologically very interesting indeed , because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals , which are just the right ones for developing life .
so if life could be established out there , it would have all the essentials — chemistry and sunlight — everything that 's needed .
and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
and of course , that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime , so in canada that 's illegal . in new zealand , it 's legal , because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits , because the rabbits compete with the sheep in new zealand .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
they look like , maybe like sunflowers .
if we do n't find them , then we can create them ourselves .
what 's going to happen in the end , it 's not going to be just humans colonizing space , it 's going to be life moving out from the earth , moving it into its kingdom . and the kingdom of life , of course , is going to be the universe . and if life is already there , it makes it much more exciting , in the short run .
not that i 'm not afraid now , but i 've learned to pretend .
we had our mothers , our aunts , our cousins , our sisters , and of course , the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words , telling us how to be .
( laughter ) we do n't know what 's going on half the time , so it puts us in a very tenuous position . ( laughter )
now i started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .
during the civil rights movement , the assassinations , the watergate hearings and then the feminist movement , and i think i was drawing , trying to figure out what was going on .
`` and i thought , `` '' well , maybe i can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning , '' '' and so i did . i became a cartoonist . ''
consequently , we have .
women , because we 're on the ground , we know the tradition .
my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world — countries such as saudi arabia , iran , turkey , argentina , france — and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties .
and i think , i truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .
thank you .
i started to write about things i recognized .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
( laughter ) she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .
and , as often happens in america , immigration became synonymous with mexicans .
there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
i remember first feeling slight surprise .
`` i told him that i had just read a novel called `` '' american psycho '' '' — ( laughter ) — and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers . ( laughter ) ''
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world ?
`` shortly after he published my first novel , i went to a tv station in lagos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , `` '' i really liked your novel . i did n't like the ending . ''
i was not only charmed , i was very moved .
what if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the lagos hospital last week ?
i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
my nigerian publisher and i have just started a non-profit called farafina trust , and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that do n't have anything in their libraries , and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , in reading and writing , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
stories matter .
many stories matter .
thank you .
( applause )
let 's summon the best designer , the mother of all designers .
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
they all crawl in different ways , and you can see on the right , that we actually made a couple of these things , and they work in reality . these are not very fantastic robots , but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for : for moving forward . so that was all done in simulation , but we can also do that on a real machine .
it 's like a rodeo show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet , but they gradually learn how to move forward , and they do this autonomously .
they begin to self-replicate . so in absence of any reward , the intrinsic reward is self-replication .
so you 're feeding it with more material — cubes in this case — and more energy , and it can make another robot .
so of course , this is a very crude machine , but we 're working on a micro-scale version of these , and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .
i was born and raised in sierra leone , a small and very beautiful country in west africa , a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent .
the reason , i would come to find out , was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well .
the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb , and which connects to the prosthetic ankle .
my hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them .
whether it 's in sierra leone or in boston , i hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential .
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known , i mean , yes , lemon squeezer , toilet brush , toothpick , beautiful toilet seats , and why not — a toothbrush ?
what animal species creates this civilization ?
when i arrive — and i take one minute , i am not so intelligent — when i arrive at the level of animal species , that becomes real interesting .
there is things to see , there is the big challenge .
at the end , finally , that succeeds , and life appears .
and we know , and especially carolyn knows , that when the sun will implode , the earth will burn , explode , i do n't know what , and this is scheduled for four , four billion years ?
because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today .
it 's our romanticism . mu-ta-tion . we are mutants .
and if we do n't deeply understand , if we do n't integrate that we are mutants , we completely miss the story .
and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius , but everybody is obliged to participate .
the first , if you want — there is so many — but one which is very easy to do , is the duty of vision .
`` if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , `` '' i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , '' '' something like that . ''
i live in society ; i live in community .
from this level , the more you can raise this angle of view , the more you will be important for the society .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
it 's better , but nobody .
god is a trap . god is the answer when we do n't know the answer .
`` that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you do n't understand , you go , `` '' ah , it 's god , it 's god . '' '' that 's ridiculous . ''
that 's why — jump , like that ? no , do n't jump .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
it 's made of light and shadow .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to shadow , we fall so fast to barbaria .
that means , when barbaria is back , forget the beautiful chairs , forget the beautiful hotel , forget design , even — i 'm sorry to say — forget art .
you must go back to fight , to battle .
because we have almost finished , i 'll repeat this story .
we give you white pages . invent .
we give you the best tools , the best tools , and now , do it .
that 's why i continue to work , even if it 's for toilet brush .
that — you know , i was born thinking about things that way , and i had always been like a little scientist guy .
and the story of that , i thought , was really fascinating .
but what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there , and see what would happen inside there .
i mean , fish do n't know much about water , and people did n't know much about air .
but both started exploring it .
it 's two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
science had been all interlocked with theology , and philosophy , and — and — and mathematics , which is really not science .
i mean , it just — it just — untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed .
it was 300,000 , probably , years ago that most of us , the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of africa and turned to the left .
and i did n't mean , you know — where is that lady ?
( laughter ) you know , that 's what you call a lead . ( laughter )
i 'm going to do it carefully , but i 'll do it .
i 'm sure it 's got to do with rockets or it would n't be in that manual .
i mean , the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down — you 'd light it , and it would just start dancing around the yard .
( laughter ) so i started developing — you know , george 's dad had a lot of help . i just had my brother .
and it was — i was following all the rules .
but at any rate , we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive .
if i 'd have waited around for that , i would have never — the frog would have died , you know .
so , so i 've got something else that 's not personal .
you know , they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process .
you want to be rich , you be a businessman .
his name was sven arrhenius . he was swedish , and he said , if you double the co2 level in the atmosphere , which he thought might — this is in 1900 — the temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees , he calculated .
well , these guys measured all of those things .
you have to figure out what all those words mean .
complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple , individual rules , and this results in emergent properties .
the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction .
bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
okay ? so that 's what this picture looks like .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we did n't know that was possible .
to understand this system , we built a computer model of roosting , based on simple , individual rules , and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony .
this is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats .
but it gets better .
and i find this incredible .
i 'm sure you know meerkats .
in the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road .
if she dies on the road , the whole group is at risk .
they adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat .
nicolas perony : i 'm okay , thanks .
np : well , i would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes .
thank you , nicolas perony .
well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain .
compassion is something that creates happiness .
compassion is fun .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and widespread company-wide .
during the haiti earthquake , a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones .
`` it was two persons saying , `` '' let 's do this , '' '' and the company said , `` '' yes . '' '' so it turns out that google is a compassionate company , because googlers found compassion to be fun . ''
but again , fun is not enough .
`` there is the affective component , which is , `` '' i feel for you . '' '' there is the cognitive component , which is , `` '' i understand you . '' '' and there is a motivational component , which is , `` '' i want to help you . '' '' so what has this got to do with business leadership ? ''
and this is the first compelling business benefit .
it makes us a highly effective company .
that 's one .
if you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free , they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way .
what a company .
the second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery .
so using the supercharged attention from step one , we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes .
thank you .
ca : ok. now , you 're 19 now ?
ca : the book had three , yours had four .
ca : and so , and that windmill , what — it worked ?
wk : four bulbs and two radios .
wk : this is my parents , holding the radio .
wk : yeah .
ca : and as you think of your life going forward , you 're 19 now , do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy ?
so anyway , who am i ?
and i really should have said something smart .
it is so much stranger than you think .
he 's an interesting little kid — and his sister , celine — and what he 's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his cheerios in his cereal bowl .
on the right , that 's a radiolara .
the secret to biology is , it builds computation into the way it makes things . so this little thing here , polymerase , is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating dna .
i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
in a neutral state , they wo n't bind at all .
so we 've got autonomous replication of bit strings .
so , neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday , i believe , but i 'll show you again .
each different color has a different magnetic polarity , and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out .
not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
and then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
so i 've been working on this a little , also , with a couple of other guys .
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
and this is , of course , not the first time you 've probably recognized this .
this is a hint that i 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors .
you know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant , but albeit evolutionary , relative .
does she make the same mistakes as us ?
and so this is the kind of thing we decided to do .
you know , where are we actually going to start with this ?
of course , that 's when we hit a sort second problem — a little bit more methodological — which is that , maybe you guys do n't know , but monkeys do n't actually use money . i know , you have n't met them .
it does n't look like much — in fact , it is n't like much .
the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure .
and that 's what the monkey can for a single token .
when we introduced sales , we saw the monkeys paid attention to that .
sounds great , but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .
so see what your intuition is here .
the guy on the left is a safe bonus .
you might say , well , maybe the monkeys just do n't like risk .
every single time , he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
the remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same irrational thing that people do .
in fact , they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history .
my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions .
how many of you here see dolphins ? raise your hand if you see dolphins . ok , those people who raised their hands , afterwards , the rest of the audience , go talk to them , all right ? actually , this is the best example of priming by experience that i know .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
right . now , when — it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . but the whole thing is actually flat . it 's painted . it 's trompe l'oeil .
so our day is 24 hours .
so you keep moving 40 minutes every day , until soon you 're coming to work in the middle of the night — the middle of the earth night .
right ? we thought , ok , we 'll just have the time on our computers and on the mission control screens , and that would be enough .
and we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was .
`` and i said , `` '' tomorrow , tomorrow , or mars , tomorrow ? '' '' we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other . ''
but even the earth daylight could confuse us .
they got up 40 minutes later every day .
but we do n't stay on mars time for more than three to four months .
eventually , we 'll move to a modified mars time , which is what we 're working now .
what it means in terms of the distances between them , how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time .
thank you .
so who gets to do it ?
i thought so .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace .
these are some of the biggest ones , and there are others opening every day .
we hack hardware , software , wetware , and , of course , the code of life .
the spirit of these labs , it 's open , it 's positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
so the united nations did just that , and they recently issued a report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative , and they even looked specifically at the diybio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics .
as a matter of fact , diy people from all over the world , america , europe , got together last year , and we hammered out a common code of ethics .
`` and sometimes people ask me , `` well , what about an accident ? '' ''
`` well , it was n't that long ago we were asking , `` '' well , what would anyone do with a personal computer ? '' '' so this stuff is just beginning . ''
you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmo 's , and you can explore your ancestry .
it 's really cool .
some people ask me , well , why am i involved ?
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
many nights , he told me , he actually slept in his trishaw so he could catch the first visitors off the all-night train .
so we turned off the wide , crowded streets , and we began bumping down rough , wild alleyways .
there were broken shacks all around .
i could get mugged or drugged or something worse .
at home , it 's dangerously easy to assume we 're on top of things .
i do n't believe that ignorance is bliss .
i can count that out on my fingers any time of night or day .
`` `` what 's the best way to raise children ? '' ''
do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow ?
do you want to know ?
but underneath all that , something that i could n't understand so moved me for reasons i could n't explain to you yet , that i decided to go and live in japan .
thinking that you know your lover or your enemy can be more treacherous than acknowledging you 'll never know them .
`` but i really like that , so i wrote a book called `` '' the laws of simplicity . '' '' i was in milan last week , for the italian launch . ''
`` after i wrote `` '' the laws of simplicity , '' '' i was very tired of simplicity , as you can imagine . ''
and so in my life , i 've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever .
`` i develop photographs , and kodak said , `` '' keep it simple . '' '' so , i felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around . ''
( laughter ) so , i looked for a different show to watch .
we 're human beings : we love complex things .
and she was a tedster , exactly , and she showed us , she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again .
and she 's very important in my life , because she 's the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
this amazing person , muriel cooper .
and i 've always felt bad about it , in a sense .
i built things in a time-graphics dimension .
so this is the leaves in my yard , essentially .
`` so , i say , `` '' no , i make eye meat , '' '' instead . ''
so , to get off the tree , i began to use my old computers .
i took these to tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
in japan , it 's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece . who 's done that before ? one-piece clementine ?
`` and as a child , i 'd hear that song , you know , `` oh , beautiful , for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain , '' so i made this amber waves image . ''
i was looking for some kind of form , and in the end , i made 100 butter-fries . do you get it ?
( laughter ) and each butter-fry is composed of different pieces .
but the laws are kind of like sushi in a way : there are all kinds .
people hate number ten like they hate uni , actually .
you know , when you want more , it 's because you want to enjoy it .
i think this is sort of simple more versus less .
basically , it always depends .
i love life . i love being alive . i like to see things .
this was given to me by the chairman of shiseido .
this whole ted effect , it sort of ups your wisdom , somehow .
openness . it 's a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities .
open-ended , open hearth , open source , open door policy , open bar . ( laughter ) and everywhere the world is opening up , and it 's a good thing .
humanity is building a machine , and this enables us to collaborate in new ways .
`` i started studying kids about 15 years ago , — so actually 20 years ago now — and i noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology , and at first i thought , `` '' my children are prodigies ! '' '' ( laughter ) but then i noticed all their friends were like them , so that was a bad theory . ''
the core modus operandi of wall street almost brought down global capitalism .
and we need to change and open up all of our institutions .
they use techniques that he 's never heard of , and for his half a million dollars in prize money , rob mcewen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold .
you know , some of the best submissions did n't come from geologists .
this is different . here , we 're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations : employees , customers , business partners , shareholders , and so on .
and everywhere , our institutions are becoming naked .
now , by buff i mean , you need to have good value , because value is evidenced like never before .
now , the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing .
but in the tunisian revolution , the new media did n't cause the revolution ; it was caused by injustice .
now , it 's not without its problems .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
i think , at the end of these four days , that you 'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a positive one , and it 's towards openness .
people did n't know about things .
now , what i 'd like to do is , to close , to share with you some research that i 've been doing .
you know , bees come in swarms and fish come in schools .
well , i look at this thing , and i get a lot of hope .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .
and in my idea , heaven is satisfied curiosity .
but it 's not only that .
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
and a lot of nationalism came in .
i was just recently in argentina and in uruguay , and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you do n't see elsewhere , but the contemporary art was terrible .
what you find at the store at the corner , without going to any kind of fancy store , is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated .
and new york has another kind of knack for contemporary art .
what i 've been doing at moma since the beginning is to try to harness the power of moma because it 's great to work there . you really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions , and that is power because in a design museum i would n't have as many visitors .
but what i 've been trying to do is something that the curators at moma in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929 , which is to try and see what 's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better .
therefore , he was not following everybody 's lead , and therefore , he was a maverick .
so , safe is the last exhibition that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year .
this is cindy van den bremen , who is a dutch designer that 's done this series of capsters .
and here is the work of two brothers from sao paulo , fernando and humberto campana , who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money .
many of you might know that the potato chip chair by charles and ray eames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden .
i 'm trying to find not the metaphors , but , rather , the points in common — the common gripes , the common issues , the common preoccupations — and i think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction , as a direction rather than a prescription of form .
and i am hoping that many of you will respond to this .
i 've sent an email already to quite a few of you .
but dangerous climate change can be subjective .
it could cause a significant loss of home , but it could also cause significant amounts of death .
and if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years , and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy , then we are much more on track for a four-degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two-degree centigrade .
the second thing is that we as human beings do n't experience global average temperatures .
it 's the hottest day that you 've ever experienced .
and this is going to be extremely challenged .
it will accumulate , and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative .
so if we continue on this red , four-degree centigrade scenario pathway , the longer we continue on it , that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget , to keep the same area under the curve , which means that that trajectory , the red one there , becomes steeper .
the other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy .
all of that will take time .
because according to our research , if you 're in a country where per capita emissions are really high — so north america , europe , australia — emissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year , and starting immediately , will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two-degree target .
the economist nicholas stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval .
if we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario , there really is no time like the present to act .
alice bows-larkin : yeah , it 's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees .
so it does make a huge difference .
but i think we 've just got huge scope , and we do n't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand , which is a shame .
it was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state .
but the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us , the police , the military , are the ones that committed most of the crimes .
i did n't care for it ; it was too painful .
the way we work is that we give people information .
a piece , an essence , of who they are .
once we have those bodies , though , we take them back to the city , to our lab , and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things : one is how people died .
now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999 .
and then you see a date .
he graduted from iowa state university and went back to guatemala to change his country .
we had the body , we had the family 's information and their dna , and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened .
so that led us to think , hmm , how many bodies were in the grave ?
all put in that grave .
thank you .
what do we know about the future ?
it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future .
how can we bring more natural light into the airplane ?
this will be very different in the future .
this here is an equal bracket for the same purpose .
the design process is completely different .
how this looks in particular , you can show it here .
and you 've got trillions of them .
what do i mean by heterophylly ?
it 's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes .
we 're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization , climate change , resource exploitation , but when that one last plant — or animal for that matter — when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this earth , we would have lost an entire subset of the earth 's biology , and with it , important plants with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic , nutrition , pharma , and even the ethno-veterinary sectors , be gone forever .
now our work , that is , the scientific validation of this traditional information , has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity , potent activity , against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans .
but the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat .
this brings me to another example .
now , our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these leaves contain ingredients that are very close , in terms of structures , chemical structures , to those medicines which are sold in the chemist 's shop against asthma .
now , i come from the developing world where we are forever being challenged with this issue of population explosion .
the one i have showed you is the one from africa , adansonia digitata .
( laughter ) now , this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought , which enables it to withstand up to 98 percent dehydration over the period of a year without damage , and yet it can regenerate itself almost completely overnight , over 24 hours , and flower .
now , if you are an inexperienced gardener , the first thing you 'll do when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it 's dead .
now , these four examples i have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem , and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity .
you know why ? because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant .
it 's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have , but we have to ensure that it has the right to live .
by 15 years later , by 1850 , doing the same thing — starting what was experienced as a mass—circulation daily paper — would come to cost two and a half million dollars .
and that 's what i want to talk about today , and how that relates to the emergence of social production .
starting with newspapers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bifurcation between producers — who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization — and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
now , if i told you that 10 years later , the motley crew of people , who did n't control anything that they produced , acquired 20 percent of the market and was the red line , it would be amazing ! right ?
think of it in minivans . a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota . right ?
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relevance , basic human expression .
the price system was a market-based and decentralized system .
not that it 's the first time that we do nice things to each other , or for each other , as social beings . we do it all the time .
as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . some of them are toolmakers .
you have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
that 's what ibm does in software services , and they 've done reasonably well .
so now you know .
we can now talk about cancer without whispering .
`` yep , this cancer is your wakeup call . '' '' now , these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience , but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel , it 's instant crap . ''
( laughter ) how is that raising awareness ?
claim your experience .
but then we get stuck .
one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year , or even several years after their treatment , because it was just really cool to see how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them .
which i used to think meant not entirely dead .
and she was using words like suffering , agony , struggle .
people were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three .
people kept leaving to get coffee .
she felt crucified by her experience , but she did n't want to let that crucified self die .
we have to let that old story go so that a new story , a truer story , can be told .
so perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me .
then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window .
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it 's very powerful .
thank you .
why is there — okay . okay . ( laughter ) this is a cosmic mystery . be solemn .
that 's a little harsh , but still . ( laughter ) so this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery , the deepest and most far-reaching question man can pose .
ludwig wittgenstein , perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century , was astonished that there should be a world at all .
`` he wrote in his `` '' tractatus , '' '' proposition 4.66 , `` '' it is not how things are in the world that is the mystical , it 's that the world exists . '' '' and if you do n't like taking your epigrams from a philosopher , try a scientist . ''
`` john archibald wheeler , one of the great physicists of the 20th century , the teacher of richard feynman , the coiner of the term `` '' black hole , '' '' he said , `` '' i want to know how come the quantum , how come the universe , how come existence ? '' '' and my friend martin amis — sorry that i 'll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk , so get used to it — my dear friend martin amis once said that we 're about five einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from . ''
and by the way , this is what most americans today believe .
and to a buddhist , the world is just a whole lot of nothing .
`` stephen hawking is one of these physicists , more recently alex vilenkin , and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine , lawrence krauss , who wrote a book called `` a universe from nothing , '' and lawrence thinks that he 's given — he 's a militant atheist , by the way , so he 's gotten god out of the picture . ''
the laws of quantum field theory , the state-of-the-art physics , can show how out of sheer nothingness , no space , no time , no matter , nothing , a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence , and then , by the miracle of inflation , blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us .
they do n't exist outside the world .
he was puzzled by this , so equations themselves ca n't do the magic , ca n't resolve the puzzle of existence .
and besides , even if the laws could do that , why this set of laws ?
why not no laws at all ? why not sheer nothingness ?
also , a younger physicist , max tegmark , who believes that all mathematical structures exist , and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence , so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility .
now , in taking this metaphysical way out , these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to plato .
`` i think that brian greene is in the audience , and he has written a book called `` '' the elegant universe . '' '' he claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant . ''
it 's not an elegant universe . ( laughter ) and then there 's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense .
then there 's the most elegant possible reality .
reality has to turn out some way .
that 's between a googol and a googolplex .
or , what if we were living in the fullest possible reality ?
through that , i connect to people .
( laughter ) i put together projects like earth sandwich , where i ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth .
it 's pretty incredible — the video 's online .
and i figured i 'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you 're going through on your job .
ze frank : so — yeah .
so that song , somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in kansas city .
`` and i said , `` '' if you put it all on this , i 'm going to deliver it to him , if you can figure out who this person is , '' '' because all i had was his name — ray — and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset . ''
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade .
he slept over at my house once , and he left his pillow .
it had 'chad ' written in magic marker on it .
right after september 11th , last year , i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it , the way that we excise it from our bodies .
and when i feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry .
`` `` dear 48 , i promise to listen to you , to fight for you , to respect you always . '' ''
and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami .
one of my viewer 's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
a guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could i write a song for her , his daughter .
and i do n't have much time .
and i shut that part down .
and i chose two people to be , and i asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on facebook .
one person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person did n't .
and when you put them together , something magical happens , something absolutely incredible happens , and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world .
the future will be more unpredictable .
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
it will become virulent and it 's something we have to build resilience against .
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago .
the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in china and in many other countries .
this would imply a massive leap in migration .
the collapse in biodiversity , climate change , pandemics , financial crises : these will be the currency that we will think about .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another .
that will be the challenge of the scholars , and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future .
this was a miracle . we can create miracles , collectively , in our lifetime .
it 's our respect .
in the 1960s — i should give you some context — in the 1960s , if you were pregnant and you were single , you were seen as a threat to the community .
you were appointed a social worker .
the adoption papers were signed , the child was given to the adoptive parents , and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she 'd been on a little break .
`` for being a woman , `` '' a little break . '' '' the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , sealed deal , an industrious , utilitarian solution : the government , the farmer , the adopting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop . ''
and what — i should say this here , because this is how they engineered my leaving .
`` they sat me at a table , my foster mom , and she said to me , `` '' you do n't love us , do you ? '' '' at 11 years old . ''
`` and i said , `` '' yeah , of course i do . '' '' because you do . ''
`` on the way to the children 's home , i started to ask myself , `` what 's happened to me ? '' ''
that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder .
but i 'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child .
i do n't mean children . i mean the child of the state .
i rented this place for myself , also by phone .
that 's when he got nervous .
so i decided to crash it .
i do plan to continue golfing every chance i get .
our journey starts in space , where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
heat from within made geysers erupt — that is how the oceans were born .
and when it vanishes , earth becomes mars .
and where that energy touches water , something new emerges : life .
once they learn how to stay upright , they grew in size and shape .
on land , life turned a corner . jaws formed first ; teeth came later .
`` jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar , and the center of brazil , where plants called `` '' cycads '' '' remain rock hard . ''
flamingos covered continents . migrations got underway .
tropical rainforests arose , sparking new layers of interdependence .
a trick shared by the largest flower on earth .
new predators , hyenas , getting faster and faster still .
some mammals turned back to water .
and cetaceans moved into a world without bounds .
there are many ways to be a mammal . a 'roo hops in oz ; a horse runs in asia ; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in brazil .
and forests dried out once more . going upright became a lifestyle .
life is a force in its own right . it is a new element .
chris anderson : perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country .
in the past , i talked about it .
but when the scenarios , the predictions came in 2007 , it became a real issue for us .
so it 's not about getting two feet .
we create them , and then we send them either north or south .
it comes with the winds , it comes with the swells , and so they can be magnified , but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern , which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level .
as you look forward , what are your options as a country , as a nation ?
we have a plan , we think we have a plan .
the japanese are interested in building floating islands .
at : well , we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community , we are preparing , we do n't want to be caught like what 's happening in europe .
what happened here ? what 's the story here ?
and so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people .
and it 's very inspiring to hear you say you 're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location .
`` as a leader , you do n't make plans to leave your island , your home , and so i 've been asked on a number of occasions , `` so how do you feel ? '' ''
climate change is a global phenomenon , and as i 've often argued , unfortunately , the countries , when we come to the united nations — i was in a meeting with the pacific island forum countries where australia and new zealand are also members , and we had an argument .
there was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions , it would be something that they 're unable to do because it would affect the industries .
there was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning .
i think something happened right here in the phoenix islands .
at : national revenue , which drives everything that we do in governments , hospitals , schools and what have you .
skipjack remains healthy .
ca : so there 's so many things playing into this .
at : well , i think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return , because what we are getting from license fees is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf , not in the retail shops .
and we only get about 10 percent .
what we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry , in the harvesting , in the processing , and eventually , hopefully , the marketing .
we 've got to tell these people that the world has changed .
is it getting harder ? are the waters depleted ?
there is so much diversity around the globe .
and you can ferret away at those little sub-questions .
do we all share a common origin , in fact ?
well , historically , it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology .
possibilities about our ancestry , but not the probabilities that we 're really looking for .
it 's composed of four subunits : a , c , g and t , we call them .
the y chromosome , the piece of dna that makes men men , traces a purely paternal line of descent .
now , even though these are simplified versions of the real trees , they 're still kind of complicated , so let 's simplify them .
that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer .
but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the y-chromosome side , the male side of the story , the y-chromosome adam only lived around 60,000 years ago .
why did n't homo erectus evolve into separate species , or sub-species rather , human races around the world ?
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?
`` well , that 's a big question . these `` '' why '' '' questions , particularly in genetics and the study of history in general , are always the big ones , the ones that are tough to answer . ''
the tool styles do n't change that much .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
these would have been savannah hunters .
so those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours , you 'll get to see what a real savannah is like .
now , that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world , the great paleolithic wanderings of our species .
in this case , you actually can .
projects around the world — documenting oral poetry in sierra leone , preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza , language revitalization in tajikistan , etc. , etc .
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america , which you can see here .
and what i 'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
this is a jury simulation deliberation room , and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror .
there is a pig 's head and african cane rats .
and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts .
this is the forensic anthropology research facility , and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition .
( laughter ) and this is ... a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired , and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity .
and the air armament center at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the united states .
essentially they 've simulated a city for urban combat , and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
and we put that wall around the world church of god , and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army .
a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker .
and here , the scene of the crime , it 's this place to which he 's never been , but changed his life forever .
he had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim .
he was convicted of rape , kidnapping and robbery , and served seven years of a 47 year sentence .
troy 's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward , but said he looked too old .
and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago .
so this curve here is the rating distribution of about 2,500 tv shows on the website imdb , and the rating goes from one to 10 , and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating .
and so when amazon is giving out free stuff , you 're going to take it , right ?
`` and sure enough , so they collect all the data , they do all the data crunching , and an answer emerges , and the answer is , `` amazon should do a sitcom about four republican us senators . '' ''
you put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion .
but it did n't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for .
but that does not change the basic setup .
well , flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too .
so you take two small nuclei , you put it together , and you make helium , and that 's very nice .
now , the particle speed is a measure of the temperature .
so the temperature required for fusion is 150 billion degrees c .
the lasers are very strong , and it squashes the ping pong ball really , really quick .
you see the laser beam and the pellet in the center .
now , this dot here is called jet , the joint european torus .
it 's a big laser machine in the u.s. , and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball .
but you have to compare that to the cost of making moore 's law .
the result of moore 's law is this cell phone here in my pocket .
so i decided i would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster .
so back to the literature , and i read about the fusion everywhere .
and then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside , and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma , and it compresses it , it gets hotter , like a laser , and then it makes fusion .
so then i thought about impact .
we are almost there .
abuse of steroids , binging and so on .
unprecedented wealth and prosperity , but that growth has n't always delivered what we needed .
and it became ever clearer that economic growth does n't automatically translate into social growth or human growth .
we 're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market .
and i 'm a very small part of a very large movement , which for some people is about survival , but is also about values , about a different kind of economy , which is n't so much about consumption and credit , but about things which matter to us .
surely , we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs , to civil society , for people able to create the new , not to the big , well-connected companies , big , clunky government programs .
you can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world .
and i think that what connects the challenge for civil society , the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is , in a way , a very simple one , but quite a difficult one .
he had helped shape britain 's post-war institutions , its welfare state , its economy , but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur , became an inventor of many , many different organizations .
( laughter ) others are much more pragmatic : health coaches , learning mentors , job clubs .
now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade , but only with radical and systematic experiment , not just with technologies , but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .
and whereas then monarchies , palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident , today it 's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city .
it will be worse at the end of this year , quite possibly worse in a year 's time than it is today .
( applause )
now , i want to tell you a quick story .
we 'll go back a little more than a year .
super bowl . i heard it over here . it was the date of the super bowl .
and they had discussed things of great national importance .
`` like , `` '' do we like the budweiser commercial ? '' '' and , `` '' do we like the nachos ? '' '' and , `` '' who is going to win ? '' '' but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support . ''
but when we talked to people , it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states .
now what is a tribe ? a tribe is a group of about 20 — so kind of more than a team — 20 to about 150 people .
well , if people see the world in such a way that life sucks , then their behavior will follow automatically from that .
i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book .
like , oh , i do n't know , tedx usc .
but you 'll notice the level of excitement .
`` one of their stated values is , `` '' be a little bit weird . '' '' and you 'll notice they are a little bit weird . ''
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
there is , in fact , another stage .
now , some of you may not recognize the scene that 's up here .
largely because people like desmond tutu set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country , to bring everyone together .
and he grew up essentially in stage one .
if you want this experience to live on as something historic , then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking .
but we 're not done yet . because then how do we go from stage four , which is great , to stage five ?
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
i was a hemiplegic , and back home in new york , i used a wheelchair for four years , all through college .
i decided to find abed , and when i finally did , he responded to my hebrew hello which such nonchalance , it seemed he 'd been awaiting my phone call .
and maybe he had .
( laughter ) i pulled into the town of abu ghosh , and bought a brick of turkish delight : pistachios glued in rosewater . better .
the light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue .
and i was mentioning abed and myself , noting deliberately that i was here in peace , to the people in this town , when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon .
he listened to me .
and as i sat contemplating what to say , a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe .
some , as had abed , would forget the date .
`` `` well , '' he said , `` i once went 60 in a 40 . '' ''
there was much i wished to say to abed .
if you are mindful of what you do not have , you may be truly mindful of what you do have , and if the gods are kind , you may truly enjoy what you have .
like if you 're looking for marijuana in students ' lockers , it 'll point right to somebody .
in fact , what skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there — if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
when we do this process , we make two types of errors .
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
for example , what do you see here ?
people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless .
so their superstitions , their patternicities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth .
so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere .
on the other hand , amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists .
just right , you 're creative , and yet you do n't fall for too much baloney .
every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
these are sandals .
pretty sexy feet , i must say .
it 's easy to fool the brain in 2d .
so what you 're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one , but with that one .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
because , let 's face it , some patterns are real .
explains a lot , maybe .
you can use — which i did , went out and did — michael persinger 's god helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
and we have our own lip balm , and we have a leading brand .
girl : no .
woman : you would n't ? ( girl : no . ) woman : you 'd think that was fine .
spiders are truly global citizens .
there are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
to put that number into perspective , here 's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
and this is what we see .
inside each spider , there are hundreds of silk glands , sometimes thousands .
in an orb-web-weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what i have depicted here in this picture , let 's start at the one o'clock position , there 's tubuliform silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
this is the silk that 's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
but what , exactly , is spider silk ?
to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like , this is a dragline silk protein , it 's just a portion of it , from the black widow spider .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
now , it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
so what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors .
in fact , this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length .
but how about variation among spider species , so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders ?
this is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider .
that 's just the best . ( laughter ) it 's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me , and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
and this theory is quite spectacular , but it has an obvious problem which is that it 's built on just a few and very specific examples .
and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious .
so you get the fruits , the body parts , the computer parts , the scientific terms and so on .
the algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy .
and then there are very fine things .
and we could go on and on with this .
and this is because , in a way , walking in this space is like walking in the mind .
so we just ran this same analysis on the judeo-christian tradition , and we got virtually the same pattern .
so i picked up the phone , and i called polo , and in fact he was not feeling well .
gracias .
( applause )
all of these dimensions have implications for our well-being , for how our life goes .
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
caffeine , for example , works much better with extroverts than it does introverts .
not to put too fine a point upon it — like that .
is that all we are ?
you have a personal project right now , but nobody may know it here .
they 're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives .
and so i act in an extroverted way , because at eight in the morning , the students need a little bit of humor , a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study .
videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself : dynamic , full of links , and completely remixable , and finally allowed to break free from the frame .
i 've added my location with a google map , and it 's live , so try moving it around .
now in the video , i mentioned adding a live feed , which we can do right now , so let 's add a live feed from flickr . go over to the right-hand side , grab flickr from the list of options , drag it into the timeline , and put it where you 'd like it to go , and it immediately goes out to flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags . now , my developers really like ponies , and so they 've set that as the default tag .
so imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web , completely remixable , linked to its source content , and interactive for everyone who views it .
thank you . ( applause )
my name is arvind gupta , and i 'm a toymaker .
i 've been making toys for the last 30 years .
it was a very revolutionary time .
it was a political ferment , so to say — students out in the streets of paris , revolting against authority .
america was jolted by the anti-vietnam movement , the civil rights movement .
in india , we had the naxalite movement , the [ unclear ] movement .
now in the early '70s , one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools .
when you pump in air in a bicycle , you use a bit of this .
if you have three of them , and you loop them together , well you make a triangle .
and they have some wonderful properties .
but this is very shaky .
give it a little push — this becomes a rhombus .
you can play around with it .
and i thought this was so much better than making trucks .
and every time i go to a school , i see a gleam in the eyes of the children .
now this , we make lots and lots of pumps .
this is one-way traffic .
this is a toy which is made from paper . it 's amazing .
with a bigger one , you make a bigger one .
there 's some grooves over here , you can see .
and this is what newton talked about 400 years back , that white light 's made of seven colors , just by spinning this around .
there 's a hole here , and i shut this .
and this costs very little money to make — great fun for children to do .
this is a little straw , and what you do is you just nip two corners here , and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth .
the other is that you keep blowing at it , keep making the sound , and you keep cutting it .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
if i crank the handle , all the wool goes inside .
there 's a factory out there making our children blind , not able to provide them with food , not able to provide them with vitamin a .
there are no patents . anyone can make it .
this is very , very simple .
lines , of course , would be cut , the force will be generated .
and you can see , this led is going to glow .
and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this .
we make lots of toys with newspapers , and this is one of them .
and the third night , he would give it two more folds — and this is a very , very famous cap .
so that 's a ship .
they were singing and dancing .
and another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down .
and the ship sinks , and the captain has lost everything , but for a life jacket .
and the khan academy videos are there .
green means the student 's already proficient .
living in africa is to be on the edge , metaphorically , and quite literally when you think about connectivity before 2008 .
i call them brothers from another mother .
all the while , we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow ushahidi and supported us in those early days .
we are humbled that this has roots in kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they 're dealing with .
consider facit .
and what did facit do when the electronic calculator came along ?
gone .
every day was about creating something new .
exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good , better .
so if we take a long-term perspective , we explore .
i think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are .
so let 's talk about the perpetual search trap .
they were simply so good at making what they loved doing , that they would n't change .
`` it seduces us into thinking we can not fail . '' '' that 's the challenge with success . ''
and they apply to our companies .
second one : think in multiple time scales .
i 'll share a chart with you , and i think it 's a wonderful one .
last one : be skeptical of success .
is that something i should do more of ?
`` i had a girl who came up who said , `` '' my dad says you 're the devil . '' '' you can not take people 's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody 's friends . ''
`` well , the second part of that , soon after — and i was talking to paul allen ; i saw him in the audience , and i handed him a copy of `` '' rare earth . '' '' and jill tarter was there , and she turned to me , and she looked at me just like that girl in `` '' the exorcist . '' '' it was , `` '' it burns ! it burns ! '' '' because seti does n't want to hear this . ''
and i really do think we have to start thinking about what 's a good planet and what is n't .
and if they 're 50 light years away , and we call them up , and you blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , and then 50 years later it comes back and they say , please repeat ?
this is the top carnivore , the t-rex of its time .
the survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile-like creatures .
this whole gaia idea , that life makes the world better for itself — anybody been on a freeway on a friday afternoon in los angeles believing in the gaia theory ? no .
this led lee kump , and others from penn state and my group , to propose what i call the kump hypothesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high co2 . and the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans .
in this particular case , the source over and over has been flood basalts .
but the second thing that 's not shown on here : the earth has never had any ice on it when we 've had 1,000 parts per million co2 .
we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .
this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps .
and we can now use this as what i think will be a major medical breakthrough .
so , the temperature starts at 25 centigrade , and down it goes , down it goes .
it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 , and comes out of this perfectly fine .
you 're in an accident . you 've got two choices : you 're going to die , or you 're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
we have a huge problem facing us as a species .
let 's start with a story about this culture that lived in micronesia in the early 1900s , called the yap .
so the yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone .
the sailors got back to the main island and they told everyone what had happened .
a collective fiction .
and when it does n't , it 's often the fault of those large institutions .
and it makes transaction costs go up .
and these things are real money .
in march , there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bitcoins .
this is actually what 's happening with the bitcoin blockchain , which is a list of all of the transactions in bitcoin .
except , it 's not done through paper .
well , the code is designed to create new bitcoin according to a schedule .
this is very close to what these computers are all actually doing .
there are actually people all over the world running this software , and we call them bitcoin miners .
cryptocurrencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money .
and i can send money around the world .
the internet caused an explosion of innovation , because it was built upon an open architecture .
digital money , like the horse and carriage , works pretty well , and the whole world economy is built on it .
and it 's very exciting , but it 's also a little bit scary .
mobile phones are annoying because they make me feel like i have to stay connected to work all the time .
the new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs .
but it 's also going to create new , flexible forms of employment .
and because of this , things are going to change and unfold in ways that we ca n't even predict .
( applause )
freedom : i do n't have to prove anything anymore .
i keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what i still have .
and it 's good to start early .
you know , for a vain female like myself , it 's very hard to age in this culture .
ethel seiderman , a feisty , beloved activist in the place where i live in california .
so how can i stay passionate ?
i have chosen to stay passionate , engaged with an open heart .
ia : oh , of course . about what ?
moderator : i was just wondering if you have anything more to share .
can you tell what it is ?
these processes are too small to be seen directly , even with the best microscopes , so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis .
biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study , and with the data we have now , that 's just not good enough anymore .
it can change the way that we communicate with one another , how we explore our data and how we teach our students .
we 're also building an online database where anyone can view , download and contribute their own animations .
( applause )
thomas dolby : david byrne .
neither am i a veteran social worker .
we could n't go to all the slums , but we tried to cover as much as we could .
`` we want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school , sent to college , and get them prepared for better living , a high value job . '' '' so , we started parikrma . ''
`` they 'll never be able to cope . '' '' not only do our children cope very well , but they excel in it . ''
all parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves , but they need to believe that change is possible .
so , you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from .
we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children .
everybody was very friendly , especially i got a lot of friends .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset , a totally different society .
i mingled with almost everyone .
i do n't even mingle , or start speaking with someone so quickly .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
it is not the infrastructure , not the toilets , not the libraries , but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important .
but we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time , not get bogged with numbers , and actually see the child complete the circle of life , and unleash his total potential .
we do not believe in scale because we believe in quality , and scale and numbers will automatically happen .
he 's in kindergarten .
`` and if you ask him what he likes to do he will say , `` '' i like sleeping . ''
well , i 'm involved in other things , besides physics .
and there are some brilliant linguists , mostly russians , who are working on that , at santa fe institute and in moscow , and i would love to see where that leads .
does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ?
how many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
so , i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further .
ca : well , philip anderson may have been right .
it is unbelievably bad .
and when you look at the worldwide sources of co2 , 52 percent are tied to buildings .
only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough .
we started r & d in 2006 .
you 're seeing for the first time , a brand new drywall production line , not made using gypsum at all .
we got our first panel out on december third .
`` nor did he tell us , `` '' trust us . trust your country . ''
the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
and yet , when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like , they encountered mike , who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise , trying to build up his strength , walking slowly up and down the hall .
and behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we 're lucky now and then , from doctors , does n't just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .
the good news is you do n't need to be brilliant to be wise .
fair enough .
the second tool we reach for is incentives .
what else , after all , is there ?
how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ?
`` reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'b . ' `` `` the bath : '' '' assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water . ''
say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .
all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city , every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .
we know why these scripts are there .
well , not always .
sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting , and they make people less likely to do it .
there was going to be a national referendum .
one : celebrate moral exemplars .
people are inspired by moral heroes .
well , acknowledge them .
why ? because it was the right thing to do .
i 'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out .
as heads of organizations , we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will .
and , perhaps most important , as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes , the moral exemplars , to the people we mentor .
the camera is always on .
that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character .
i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
in many ways , it 's what ted is all about .
thank you very much .
when you grow up in a developing country like india , as i did , you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have .
in africa , if you run out of your cell phone battery , do n't panic .
for the past seven years , i have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in india , china , africa and south america , and they keep amazing me .
when external resources are scarce , you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource , human ingenuity , and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources .
frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value using fewer resources .
think of the iphone 5 , 6 , then 7 , 8 .
and third , most importantly , because of the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class in the west , there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers .
let me give you an example .
second example is be-bound , also in silicon valley , that enables you to connect to the internet even in no-bandwidth areas where there 's no wi-fi or 3g or 4g .
amazingly , 75 percent of the customers using this service are the middle-class french who ca n't afford high banking fees .
`` when i first saw them , i thought , `` '' holy cow . '' '' literally , because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in nairobi . ''
granted , megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars , but it promises to take nairobi drivers from point a to point b at least 20 percent faster .
the first principle is : keep it simple .
now , i have n't met these particular students , but i 've met students like them .
the president wanted to change this rule .
and nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights .
are there some rules we can develop for changing rules ?
when they separated , they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules .
chinese had pioneered technologies like steel , printing , gunpowder .
but the chinese never adopted , at least in that period , effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas — a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread .
in the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent .
but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .
one is : preserve choices for people .
on the other hand , the nation is too big .
but cities give you this opportunity to create new places , with new rules that people can opt in to .
and they 're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules .
so the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city .
we start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we 'll need to build the city .
that 's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land .
it 's not . but it 's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things , can get in the way , can make us pull back , can shut down our ability , and our interest in trying to explore new ideas .
let 's take a particular leader , raul castro , who is the leader of cuba .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .
there are immense stretches of land like this — land where hundreds of millions of people could live .
turns out singapore and hong kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started .
how could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job , assembling something like an iphone , but make those buildings energy efficient , and make sure that they are safe , so they do n't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane .
when we share ideas we all get more .
but there is another class of ideas : the rules that govern how we interact with each other ; rules like , let 's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free .
`` ( applause ) it was a cold day in january when my scholar , vidal chastanet , met brandon stanton , the founder of the popular blog `` '' humans of new york . '' '' brandon shared the story of a young man from brownsville who had witnessed violence firsthand , by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof . ''
the revolution in education is happening in our schools , with adults who provide love , structure , support and knowledge .
that means everyone in here , and those who are watching the screen .
in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible . right now
`` there 's a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards , who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately , while at the same time saying to herself over and over again , `` do n't smile till november , '' because that 's what she was taught in her teacher education program . ''
right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention , a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before , but if they close their eyes tightly enough , they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling .
that preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
he drops his voice at a very , very low volume when he wants people to key into him , and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers .
`` now people oftentimes say , `` '' well , magic is just magic . '' '' there are teachers who , despite all their challenges , who have those skills , get into those schools and are able to engage an audience , and the administrator walks by and says , `` wow , he 's so good , i wish all my teachers could be that good . '' ''
now , how do you teach it ? you teach it by allowing people
they learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch , you do n't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more .
it does n't ; it begins with the beginning of life .
we sought children from the time they 're born .
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
the cost of a cup of coffee can save a child 's life , right .
i mean who can argue with that ?
i know many in the room probably know exactly who he is , but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak , dr. yunus won the nobel peace prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance .
and in fact , through those interactions , for the first time , i was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away .
so i would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats .
they might be able to buy mosquito nets .
maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure .
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
in october of '05 , after those first seven loans were paid , matt and i took the word beta off of the site .
imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you 're about to approach them .
imagine how you feel ; and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business .
now for me , kiva is just the beginning .
so they 're not a donation .
i see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that i 'm tuned into this .
with social networks , it 's an amazing way , growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities , rapidly .
so in short , it 's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds .
but the good news is i do n't think i need to stand here and convince you to care — i 'm not even going to try .
and i think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try
it 's full of us , it 's full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion — that we 're living beyond our means .
in other words , thanks to those pesky laws of physics , when things are n't sustainable , they stop .
mother nature does n't negotiate ; she just sets rules and describes consequences .
it 's not that it 's not possible to feed , clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .
now we 've had 50 years of warnings .
i accept where we are .
the crisis is now inevitable .
imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts , when the financial markets recognize that , to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control , the oil and coal industries are finished .
imagine china , india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water .
imagine our highly-tuned , just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .
if we feel it now and think it through , we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .
you see , those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem , that technology is limitless , that markets can be a force for good , are in fact right .
and this is where you come in .
we 've built a powerful foundation of science , knowledge and technology — more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent , meaningful and satisfying lives .
well it 's time to grow up , to be wiser , to be calmer , to be more considered .
( applause )
and there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success .
and the result is the terrafugia transition .
that was beautiful from up here , i tell you .
we 've gone from being three of us working in the basement at mit while we were still in graduate school to about two-dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of boston .
still , if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we 're working on right now , those first deliveries to the , about a hundred , people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year .
so , that 's what i want to talk about today .
`` so , i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged `` '' mermaid parade . '' '' there were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers , all aggregated and then put under this nice , neat name , shown in reverse chronological order . ''
the classic answer is to form an institution , right ?
no good just hiring employees , you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth .
right ? you have to have economic structure .
third , forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .
we 've gone from people with photos to photographers .
what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination .
the photos are spread out over a longer period of time .
and it 's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer .
so , we 'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos , and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did .
if you go down to five percent , you 're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos .
this is the math underlying the 80/20 rule . right ?
build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount .
but when you 're down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that 's institution as obstacle .
many , many institutions are still in denial , but we 're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining .
we hired this programmer , he came in , he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea .
what if it was a security patch ?
stay-at-home moms . right ?
in the suburbanized , dual-income united states , stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local , small-scale neighborhoods .
and i use that word advisedly .
it has de-professionalized publishing .
we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .
now , i 'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
adam i savors accomplishment .
adam i asks how things work .
you have to conquer the desire to get what you want .
in order to fulfill yourself , you have to forget yourself .
you go into yourself , you find the sin which you 've committed over and again through your life , your signature sin out of which the others emerge , and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin , and out of that wrestling , that suffering , then a depth of character is constructed .
you 're going to cheat , or you 're going to allow bullying .
and could we be inspired by hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work ?
so what are these characteristics that i 'm talking about ? these are them .
we consider first that life has a body .
life also has a metabolism . now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself .
and so what we do is , we start simple and we work our way up to living systems .
what that means is , i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab , and these chemicals will start to self-associate to form larger and larger structures .
what about the other aspects of living systems ?
so we came up with this protocell model here that i 'm showing .
so just through self-assembly , mixing things together in the lab , we can come up with , say , a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body , right ?
some things are missing .
we take this same moving protocell here , and we put it in another experiment , get it moving . then i 'm going to add some food to the system , and you 'll see that in blue here , right ?
if we count the number of chemicals in that system , actually , including the water that 's in the dish , we have five chemicals that can do this .
right ? so not only do individual protocells have behavior , what we 've interpreted as behavior in this system , but we also have basically population-level behavior similar to what organisms have .
so remember , these are primitive things , so dancing protocells , that 's very interesting to us . ( laughter ) the second protocell has a different chemistry inside , and when activated , the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one . right ?
certainly , there were molecules present on the early earth , but they would n't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and i showed in these experiments .
you turn up the heat , you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar , forming a brownish caramel , right ?
if you let that go unregulated , you 'll continue to make and break chemical bonds , forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan , right , that 's difficult to wash out . so that 's what the origin of life would have looked like .
his wrist went completely limp , like this .
`` but i was watching these people , and i was listening to them , and they were saying , `` '' i , i do this , i do that , '' '' and there was a real unfamiliarity between them . ''
so for the next two years , we just watched my son be taken away from me , little by little every day .
he talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device , and we 're watching his lungs , because his diaphragm eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not .
over the next couple of days , our news feed was full of family and friends .
so we got together , put our best 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) s on pete 's website , and off we went .
( laughter ) week three , celebrities — entertainment tonight , access hollywood .
week four , global — bbc , irish radio .
it 's absolutely fantastic .
`` because this misunderstood and underfunded `` '' rare '' '' disease , they just sat and watched people saying it over and over : `` '' als , als . '' '' it was unbelievable . ''
and those naysayers , let 's just talk a couple of stats , shall we ?
( applause ) and youtube has reported that over 150 countries have posted ice bucket challenges for als .
i know that i 'm running over , but i 've got to leave you with this : the gifts that my son has given me .
he 's thrown out kindness , and all that kindness has come back to him .
now i know why i 'm here .
be passionate .
be hardworking .
and do n't forget to be great .
it 's closer than you think . it 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft .
( laughter ) another difference , and i have to describe this , because it 's very personal , another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor — in my case the skycar volantor — is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those .
when you get in the skycar — and i can tell you , there 's only one other person that 's flown it , but he had the same sensation — you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet , without any vibration whatsoever . the sensation is unbelievable .
and it 's been a great motivator .
on this next slide , is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure , because whether i give you a perfect skycar , the perfect vehicle for use , it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in .
so , i 'm not going to quote myself on this .
there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s , when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft .
if that single-stability system , that brain that flies that aircraft , fails , or if the engine fails , that vehicle crashes . there is no option to that .
getting that energy is very , very difficult . it all comes down to that power plant — how to get a large amount of power in a small package .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
the computers back up each other . there 's a voting system — if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it 's kicked out of the system .
and then you have three — you still have the triple redundancy .
there wo n't be a third chance .
i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism , as it 's described , which really talks about what i 've experienced , and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies .
what is going on with men ?
and i would tell you that the average american watches five hours of television a day .
and i 'll tell you , any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a prop , not as a talking point , but as a participant , as a creator .
well , how do we make this happen ?
so as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers , he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics .
`` it 's called `` '' the joy of voting . '' '' `` `` i would like to vote for the first time because things are changing for hispanics . ''
`` i can stand up and do something . '' '' `` `` the joy of voting '' '' project is n't just about joy . ''
it 's about this passion .
when politics becomes just a presidential election , we yell and we scream at our screens , and then we collapse , exhausted .
why bother ?
`` but let me give you an answer to this question , `` '' why bother ? '' '' that is maybe a little less spiritual and a bit more pointed . ''
the second school i was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tulip tree , i think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it , around the playing fields .
and 30 years later i was sitting in an airplane , next to a lady called veronica , who came from chile , and we were on a human rights tour , and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured , and , from my very privileged position , this was the only reference point that i had .
so i got involved with this tour , which was for amnesty , and then in '88 i took over bono 's job trying to learn how to hustle .
and 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers , and the international criminal court is going after five of the leaders of the — now , what 's it called ?
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he 's done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
and we 've also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it 's ubiquitous ; and it 's moving fast all around the world — and it 's very exciting for us .
as part of selling , i was able to document the hard core evidence .
my journalism is hinged on three basic principles : naming , shaming and jailing .
it 's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive way .
for the first time , i filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this , and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people .
i 've never stepped there before .
i have not done any business with anybody .
reporter : when metro news contacted investigative reporter anas aremeyaw anas for his reaction , he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen .
the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled .
now , i happen to have followed one of my inmates , one of my friends , from his sick bed till death , and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all .
`` show me the evidence . '' '' i say , `` '' this is the evidence . '' '' and that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars . ''
thank you very much .
ca : talk to me just about fear and how you manage that , because you 're regularly putting your life at risk .
aaa : you see , undercover is always a last resort .
and we 're appreciative . we salute you . thank you so much , anas .
ca : thank you . stay safe . ( applause )
this is neat .
and that 's my new life .
no . but is it fun ?
`` instead of saying , `` '' you got 73,000 results . ''
i bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it .
there was this wonderful review in the new york times about the mini cooper automobile .
`` it said , `` '' you know , this is a car that has lots of faults . ''
so that 's my new life ; it 's all about fun .
no problem .
and , basically , none of them could solve it .
and guess what — they solved the problem .
and it turns out that when you 're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth-first .
`` you get a little problem , you say , `` '' ah , i 'll figure it out . '' '' no big deal . ''
that 's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants , because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed .
they keep it for — you know , it 's like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it 's not the water .
automatic behavior — skilled behavior — is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side .
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usability , understanding — but also the feel and heft .
there 's a little ledge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that .
`` owners of the hummer have said , `` '' you know i 've owned many cars in my life — all sorts of exotic cars , but never have i had a car that attracted so much attention . '' '' it 's about attention . it 's about their image , not about the car . ''
but it 's ugly .
( laughter ) ( applause )
that means if an african child is born today , rather than three days ago , they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan .
does anyone recognize this ? in fact , they do .
and this investment is actually western-led .
it 's the same as saudi arabia or russia .
so where do you set up your new factory ?
a bit dangerous , sometimes .
today , sub-sahara is at the levels that turkey and mexico were at in 1975 .
and what you 'll see here is that most africans are now living in democracies .
when you 're poor , corruption is not your biggest priority .
economists are n't great at forecasting .
that new cover shows , well , africa rising , because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent .
it grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half .
`` it was n't a `` '' hindu rate of growth , '' '' `` '' democracies ca n't grow . '' '' actually india could . ''
and you know what ?
am i really saying that there can be nothing learned , yes from the positives in asia and india , but also the negatives ?
( applause )
this is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility , in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids .
we have another well-known case — gustavo dudamel .
the effect of el sistema is felt in three fundamental circles : in the personal/social circle , in the family circle and in the community .
it 's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home , while her mother does the housework .
the idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to .
i believe that to confront such a crisis , only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity , to mankind 's deepest aspirations , and to the historic demands of our times .
two twin domes , two radically opposed design cultures .
one is synthetic , the other organic .
but you do n't find homogenous material assemblies in nature .
thank you .
and in fact , there 's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years .
this disease appears first as tumors , usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils .
all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus .
we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor , get into the saliva .
he discovered this , a huge bleeding tumor at the base of kimbo 's penis .
the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor , a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs .
it 's a living relic of the distant past .
what this tells us , ethical issues aside , is that ...
but that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer .
thank you .
( applause )
my mother left school when she was 15 .
art : what humanity has done ever since it evolved .
i think it 's a little girl .
and i thought , well , who painted this joyful , youthful figure ?
`` i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal importance : `` e.t . '' and `` hamlet . '' ''
they decide they 're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can , and they plop him in a bicycle basket , and off they ride .
but unfortunately , the baddies have found out , and they 're catching up and they 've got sirens and they 've got their guns , they 've got the loud-hailers , it 's terribly frightening , and they 're closing up on the children , and the children are never going to make it .
men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication , but of course , how could they be ?
my question is : why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example of human dilemma and human experience ?
he talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option , but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide , ophelia , after she 's been humiliated and abused by him , never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings .
because once you feel that you ca n't stand in the central space and speak on behalf of the world , you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small , select group .
let 's make a change to all our institutions , and not just in the west .
do n't forget — this message of incapability of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in nigeria , in china , in russia , in indonesia .
and i want to ask you : do you believe that ?
and i 'm calling on all artists , women and men , to imagine a gender-equal world .
let 's paint it . let 's draw it .
when i was a young boy , i used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house .
so the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis , which was standing four meters tall weighing about 10 tons , and was a woodland-adapted species and spread from western europe clear across central asia , across the bering land bridge and into parts of north america .
so there 's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment , and doing very , very well .
but a few of them actually have dna fragments that survive for thousands , even a few millions of years in time .
remember , this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation .
i do n't know where we are now .
this is the hang seng index for hong kong .
and if they do that all at once , it 's like playing poker and going all in right away .
and all of that 's great , and it 's fine .
and if these algorithms , like the algorithms on wall street , just crashed one day and went awry , how would we know ?
these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means .
people panic .
`` all it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says , `` '' stop . '' '' and this is what we 're designing for . ''
and of course , it is , but it 's distributed from places .
in new york , this is where it 's distributed from : the carrier hotel located on hudson street .
it involves light cones and quantum entanglement , and i do n't really understand any of that .
but i can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you 're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that 's where people are , where the cities are , you 're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
( applause )
it 's not robotics .
this is democratized information .
`` this has been called the `` '' double-spend '' '' problem by cryptographers for a long time . ''
they slow things down .
our privacy is being undermined .
it 's not a fiat currency controlled by a nation-state .
assets — digital assets like money to music and everything in between — are not stored in a central place , but they 're distributed across a global ledger , using the highest level of cryptography .
and today , on the ethereum blockchain , there are projects underway to do everything from create a new replacement for the stock market to create a new model of democracy , where politicians are accountable to citizens .
well , with a blockchain financial industry , there would be no settlement , because the payment and the settlement is the same activity , it 's just a change in the ledger .
and this is at the heart of all of the anger and extremism and protectionism and xenophobia and worse that we 're seeing growing in the world today , brexit being the most recent case .
could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place by democratizing wealth creation , engaging more people in the economy , and then ensuring that they got fair compensation ?
so today , companies are working with governments to put land titles on a blockchain .
she clicks on a teller that 's a five-star teller , who 's seven minutes away .
number four : the most powerful asset of the digital age is data .
and the virtual you may know more about you than you do , because you ca n't remember what you bought a year ago , or said a year ago , or your exact location a year ago .
take music .
and that 's a wonderful thing .
now , technology does n't create prosperity , of course — people do .
it 's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university , except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns , and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health , as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals .
number one was asthma , number two was developmental delays , number three was 400-fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to 10 , 15 years .
so all of those — what 's common about all of those ?
some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed : this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol , or keeping tabs , if you will .
and we give them a couple of things to do that , to help them do companion animal devices while they 're blogging and doing their email .
this is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening .
coping with environmental stressors is tricky .
so this was prozac , this was zoloft , this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant , all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking .
and that aggregating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though , there 's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .
that 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there , it 's infiltrating pollutants .
it 's also increasing fixing co2s , sequestering some of the airborne pollutants .
so it 's on legs , so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns .
this is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in spain .
we are not alone ; the animals are moving in .
this is actually in the whitney museum , where there were six of them , each of which had a different argument on it , different sound file .
they said things like this .
do you know what slows it down ?
`` and so every time that desire to interact with the animals , which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign : `` '' do not feed the animals . '' '' and there 's about three of them on every new york city park . ''
that is how our women dress .
( laughter ) our national dress is unique , but this is not the only thing that 's unique about my country .
back in the 1970s , our fourth king famously pronounced that for bhutan , gross national happiness is more important than gross national product .
education is completely free .
our economy is small , and we must strengthen it .
today , our culture is flourishing .
in this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to ipads , office files and books .
so our culture is flourishing , but so is our environment .
72 percent of my country is under forest cover .
incidentally , our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us .
but he went further .
so as i was saying , 72 percent of our country is under forest cover , and all that forest is pristine .
that 's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world , and that 's why we are a carbon neutral country .
turns out , it 's a big deal .
actually , that 's not quite accurate .
so inside our country , we are a net carbon sink .
outside , we are offsetting carbon .
two years later , that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains .
over the next few years , our small economy wo n't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment .
this means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they 'll be left supporting an underfunded plan .
we expect to close later this year .
naturally , i 'm pretty excited .
so in closing , i 'd like to share one more dream that i have .
they too have natural resources that can help win the world 's fight for sustainability , only they may not have the ability to invest in them now .
after all , we 're here to dream together , to work together , to fight climate change together , to protect our planet together .
some of us might dress differently , but we are in it together .
( applause ) thank you , thank you , thank you .
it has caused almost four million deaths .
i was a young humanitarian aid worker , and i met this woman who was my age .
well , it 's because of people like isabelle and her husband that i have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about .
so , not that these two issues are n't important and tragic . they are .
congo hosts the largest and most expensive united nations peacekeeping mission in the world .
and i was one of these people , and i shared this culture , so i know all too well how powerful it is .
it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace as something again that requires top-down intervention to address national and international tensions .
and the answer is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict an unimportant , unfamiliar , and illegitimate task .
and it 's not that national and international peacebuilding is n't necessary .
it is .
so international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution .
( laughter ) and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry — ( laughter ) and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success , or gleeful calamity .
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand .
even those mundane , hateful , plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined .
( applause ) gt : thank you . it 's been a great pleasure . ( applause )
how should you deliver your talk ?
and now the most important thing , that is the mood onstage .
you only have to make one decision , and that is : are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks , about creativity , human genius ?
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible tedtalks .
and i hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this , which i really want to see .
you ca n't keep a good idea down these days .
`` i 'm a little nervous , because my wife yvonne said to me , she said , `` '' geoff , you watch the ted talks . '' '' i said , `` '' yes , honey , i love ted talks . '' '' she said , `` '' you know , they 're like , really smart , talented — `` '' i said , `` '' i know , i know . '' '' ( laughter ) she said , `` '' they do n't want , like , the angry black man . '' '' ( laughter ) so i said , `` '' no , i 'm gon na be good , honey , i 'm gon na be good . i am . '' '' but i am angry . ( laughter ) and the last time i looked , i 'm — ( applause ) so this is why i 'm excited but i 'm angry . ''
do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them . i know they could .
and you know something about a lousy school ?
`` look , you go into a place that 's failed kids for 50 years , and you say , `` '' so what 's the plan ? '' '' and they say , `` '' we 'll , we 're going to do what we did last year this year . '' '' what kind of business model is that ? ''
what about introducing technology ?
`` so i was a little slow , and i did not trust technology , and when they first came out with those new contraptions , these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money , i was like , `` '' there 's no way that machine is going to count that money right . ''
why is it that when we had rotary phones , when we were having folks being crippled by polio , that we were teaching the same way then that we 're doing right now ?
`` i said , `` '' oh , wow , this is an important study . '' '' because it suggests we should do something . ''
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
you know , i always wonder , who makes up those rules ?
because our business has refused to use science .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
but we know this is critical .
and so , what do you do ?
you do n't look at it .
i need to know you 're struggling , and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that .
and you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level .
`` you know , people tell me , `` '' yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them do n't work . '' '' a lot of them do n't . they should be closed . ''
when the safety of america is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
this year 's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school .
`` they harass you , right ? they call you , they say , `` '' i want to see your grades . how 'd you do on that last test ? ''
please give it up for him one more time .
is based not only on the relationship between governments , but the common language and the values that we share , and i 'm reminded of that by watching you all today .
i was n't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .
and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother .
they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family .
we all know .
you 're going to write the next chapter in history .
the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family .
the difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls .
i liked being smart .
that is true . that is the reality of the world that we live in .
and i hope in pursuing your dreams , you all remain resolute , that you go forward without limits , and that you use your talents — because there are many ; we 've seen them ; it 's there — that you use them to create the world as it should be .
we are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be .
and it 's full of challenges .
okay , so , most people only wondered that occasionally , like today , in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them .
i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
they did n't know how to .
but never mind the symbols .
but that ability to make progress remained almost unused , until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe .
how to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know .
the enlightenment , a revolution in how people sought knowledge , trying not to rely on authority .
it did help by promoting observation and experiment .
we do n't see the curvature of space-time , and other universes .
well , the classic empiricist answer is induction .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .
brains only detect nerve impulses .
our connection to reality is never just perception .
consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons .
and here is the crucial thing .
why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action ?
but now , the fact that it 's also a good explanation , hard to vary , makes the crucial difference .
if the ancient greeks had found out about seasons in australia , they could have easily varied their myth to predict that .
for instance , when demeter is upset , she banishes heat from her vicinity , into the other hemisphere , where it makes summer .
no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres .
it 's the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment .
one is well known : untestable theories .
`` ( laughter ) and the question he had is , `` can i do it ? can it be done ? '' ''
we got there first .
i do n't know if this is called a basket-bra , but it ought to be something like that .
you know what those are , right ?
now the background is — the guy who did this is a physicist .
how many people here would say you 're a maker , if you raise your hand ?
you 're makers of food ; you 're makers of shelter ; you 're makers of lots of different things , and partly what interests me today is you 're makers of your own world , and particularly the role that technology has in your life .
they want to use it to their own purpose .
they 're a bit subversive in what they do .
( music ) ( video ) narrator : of all things americans are , we are makers .
but it was a sense of pride that we made things , that the world around us was made by us .
and i think that 's tremendously important .
i met andrew at one of our community meetings putting together maker faire .
he liked to take things apart .
and that 's why he moved to michigan .
and you ca n't see this very well on the screen , but arduino — arduino is an open-source hardware platform .
so you figure out how to program this , and you put this in your mailbox .
and when someone opens your mailbox , you get a notification , an alert message goes to your iphone .
now here 's something — a 3d printer .
well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones .
this is a radar speed detector that was developed from a hot wheels toy .
fascinating work they 're doing .
makers are a source of innovation , and i think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry .
but it 's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries — even like henry ford — come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i 'm just going to use a piece of paper here .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let 's say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i 'm trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
now i 'm an optimist , so i sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition .
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we 're right in the middle of it .
it 's about as far as we go out .
now in order to do that i 'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
somehow by ways that we do n't quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
( laughter ) if i had really been a egotist , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room . ( laughter )
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were synergistic .
and in fact , we 're such a multi-cellular community .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
we 're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through — abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
and i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
there are billions of them .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
so we 're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that 's very different than engineering .
the thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing .
and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms .
the worst have thankfully not yet happened .
it 's like the drug laws — we try to regulate , but ca n't .
i and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already , via cosmic ray collisions .
biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens .
( applause )
well , why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very , very important ?
we were able to reopen that fishing port , using her sonar , in four hours .
you 're talking about a disaster where you ca n't fit a person or a dog — and it 's on fire .
and he was here , as you well know , in '35 .
`` and he described one of them as very `` '' common . '' '' this was the sailfin grouper . ''
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
we still think it is pristine .
( laughter ) because i was there in '71 , studying a lagoon in west africa .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
( applause )
there 's six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
and at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well .
and you can eat something new everyday .
that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
and now you may think , okay , in this provincial town in china they 're doing that , but not us .
but there 's tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
in the developed world it 's on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
it 's 25 kilograms per person per year .
you get a new disease that can be deadly .
and even in terms of calories , it is very good .
i gave you at least four arguments in favor .
on the left-hand side , you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
`` in fact , a locust is a `` '' shrimp '' '' of the land , and it would make very good into our diet . ''
a dutch chocolate maker .
it 's really taken off the ground .
i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects , because it 's just a normal way of doing .
bg : that 's exactly the same [ one ] you saw in the video actually .
and it looks delicious .
i think it 's reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns .
now clearly , these are environmental and social issues , but that 's not all .
investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call esg : environment , social and governance .
but 93 percent see esg as the future , or as important to the future of their business .
that 's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars off the road .
in blue , we see the performance of the 500 largest global companies , and in gold , we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management .
but it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns .
calpers is the pension fund for public employees in california , and with assets of 244 billion [ dollars ] , they are the second largest in the u.s .
why ? they believe it 's critical to superior long-term returns , full stop .
`` this is why we are concerned with esg . '' '' now , i do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job , and not all of them see it this way . ''
the global bond market , 78 trillion .
that 's the world 's largest economy .
( laughter ) i like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue .
i remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule , while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to kalaupapa .
what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket ?
and pakistan , in this particular vein , is very similar .
do you see me simply smothered in cloth ?
a rising tide lifts all boats .
i just really wanted to acknowledge you .
( applause ) thank you so much .
and second , that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
we perform a million of these a year in the united states alone .
this is the real thing . there 's no blood .
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
surgeons are trained one step at a time .
we ca n't travel everywhere .
we need to make the world a smaller place .
this is allan okrainec from toronto .
very inspiring .
we have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital .
and there is n't always a translator available .
so i 'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world .
i want to talk to the people in asia , latin america , africa , europe seamlessly , accurately and in a cost-effective fashion using technology .
and in that i need a surgery lexicon .
students may display captions in their native language .
`` steven schwaitzberg : if you 're in latin america , you click the `` '' i want it in spanish '' '' button and out it comes in real time in spanish . ''
it 's important to be accurate .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
it looks very much like the apollo pictures that are very well known .
i can extract information from these .
this is what we call , in computer science , simulation .
at the archivio di stato , you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of venice over more than 1,000 years .
if you have a very good model of a language which is used , if you have a very good model of a document , how well they are structured .
and this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
so the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the european level .
of course , you understand , the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying , quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process .
this is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in geneva with that type of system .
my mom taught me to dance when i was five , and my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine .
mom and dad raised beef cattle , and i 'm the oldest boy .
my mom plays piano , and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in cape breton . before mom 's family had a piano in cape breton , she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board , and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter 's evenings and mom would be banging on this board , so when they bought a piano , they bought it in toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse , a horse and sleigh to the house .
so one day i stayed a little late after school , a little too late , and i lurked in the girls ' bathroom .
all of those a 's . ( laughter ) and i got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too .
i do n't understand why i was never caught .
`` well no faithless helen , no `` '' odyssey . '' '' no jealous king , no `` '' arabian nights . '' '' no shakespeare . ''
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
we forget how pitiless he is .
as the teller of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to dig that knife in . right ?
`` in the first volume , swann 's way , the series of books , swann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are proustian sentences , so they 're long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly recoils and he realizes , `` '' hang on , everything i love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman . ''
but you do n't have to be that jealous to concede that it 's hard work . right ?
freud would write about this later .
[ freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife 's unconscious .
the novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
in fact , the more intensely jealous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy .
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive .
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters .
take tom ripley , her most famous character .
i mean , we 're all good citizens of social media , are n't we , where the currency is envy ?
oh , it 's so familiar to me .
so to understand this , let me show you what a normal transit in kepler data looks like .
the white line is light just from the star , what astronomers call a light curve .
they said and object like jupiter would make a drop like this in the star 's light , but they were also saying it was giant .
and again , after this , not much happens until february of 2013 .
this is truly remarkable .
we wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory .
ok , well , imagine a civilization that 's much more advanced than our own .
so they would go and build huge structures .
this image above are lots of artists ' impressions of dyson spheres .
you can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven , unnatural looking dips .
another idea that 's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet .
( laughter ) you can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
but do n't get me wrong , i do think it would be awesome to find aliens .
but first , i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system , for the oceans and for the earth .
when i came to the galapagos 40 years ago , there were 3,000 people that lived in the galapagos .
it 's the same problems in the galapagos , except , obviously , it 's worse here , in some ways , than other places .
and when i came at age 22 to live on fernandina , let me just say , that i had never camped before .
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year , and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there .
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years , and what i learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wildlife , and the amazing qualities that penguins have .
humans , without fins : 90 meters , 3.5 minutes .
you have to train to be able to do that .
why i thought i was going to be able to do that , i do n't know .
this is a cold-water event called la nina .
things die when there 's no food .
but we did n't even know that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins .
and you can imagine being on an island hoping you 're going to see penguins , and you 're in the middle of an el nino event and there are no penguins .
this is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
they moved the tanker lanes 40 kilometers farther off shore , and people are not doing as much illegal dumping .
try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins .
and so we started a publication with the society for conservation that we think presents cutting-edge science in a new , novel way , because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public .
so if you 're interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation , you should join with our 11 partners — some of them here in this room , like the nature conservancy — and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public .
he met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck : a turbo truck , so we named him turbo .
see , this one 's coming back to its nest .
it 's been around for about 7,000 years .
sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because , you can tell that the holes are made partially and then , i think , there was some trepanation , and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole , and we know they survived these procedures .
and this is accomplished using this kind of device , and this is called deep brain stimulation .
we can turn it up or down , on or off .
you see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there , and we can place this really anywhere in the brain .
( applause ) on the basis of this result , this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world , and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery .
it is the sadness center of the brain .
we 're able to drive down area 25 , down to a more normal level , and we 're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain , and indeed we 're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression .
can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter ?
now we 're not going to do this in normal people .
so we 've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix , which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit , with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit , and whether that can , in turn , help these patients with alzheimer 's disease .
now it turns out that in alzheimer 's disease , there 's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain .
can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again ?
so this is what we did . we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with alzheimer 's disease , we turned it on , and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain .
and indeed , we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again .
one of the most exciting things about this is that , indeed , it involves multidisciplinary work .
it sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
and it 's not just fun and games .
and you know , to be honest , i 've been doing this for seven years , and i have n't got a clue what the future is going to be like .
but i 've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there .
it 's kind of like stalking with permission .
if you prefer this kind of maslow 's hierarchy of needs , those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in maslow 's hierarchy of needs .
yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they 're very good at this .
and pretty much everyone does it at some point .
and in fact , when you 're turning around , and you 're looking inside the house , and you 're looking for this stuff , this is where you look first , right ?
so , we 've been conducting a lot of research .
just from a design perspective , we did n't really understand how they did it , and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing .
sente is a word in uganda that means money .
and it works like this .
and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk .
it brings rudimentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure .
but the difference between this and that is , there 's no central authority trying to control this .
they 'll give you a new one .
i 'm not going to answer that , ok .
but i look at something like this , and i consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process .
when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile , it is n't fixed ?
it 's from a study we did into illiteracy , and it 's a guy in a teashop .
and it 's not necessarily the same values , but some kind of values of livestrong , to actually go out and purchase them , and actually display them .
the next thing is that , however we design this stuff — carefully design this stuff — the street will take it , and will figure out ways to innovate , as long as it meets base needs — the ability to transcend space and time , for example .
that 's my feeling .
so thank you very , very much .
he was texting , and he could n't text and walk at the same time .
if you turn it off , that 's called a coma , okay ?
so right now , you 're doing just fine .
now working memory has four basic components .
they tend to solve and do well on standardized tests , however important that is .
while you 're hanging on to them , i 'm going to ask you to answer three questions .
i want to see what happens with those words .
you should have started with z .
some people can hang on to five .
now do n't get me wrong , working memory is awesome .
we can have a conversation , and i can build a narrative around that so i know where we 've been and where we 're going and how to contribute to this conversation .
it allows us to problem-solve , critical think .
it 's limited in capacity , limited in duration , limited in focus .
have you ever been involved in a conversation , and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting ? ( laughter ) so you 're nodding and you 're smiling , but you 're really paying attention to this one over here , until you hear that last word go up , and you realize , you 've been asked a question . ( laughter ) and you 're really hoping the answer is no , because that 's what you 're about to say .
now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence , our life , immediately and repeatedly .
so we need to think about , well , do i agree with him ?
it 's a way of processing what 's going on so that we can use it later .
now we also need to repeat it . we need to practice .
we also want to use imagery . we are built for images .
we all started as novices .
we 're seeing the consequences all around us .
now that , i suggest , is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously .
so , memetics : memetics is founded on the principle of universal darwinism .
indeed , some people say it 's the best idea anybody ever had .
is n't that a wonderful thought , that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had ?
it 's all just the same thing happening .
what darwin said was something like this : if you have creatures that vary , and that ca n't be doubted — i 've been to the galapagos , and i 've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on , and so on .
( laughter ) and if there is a struggle for life , such that nearly all of these creatures die — and this ca n't be doubted , i 've read malthus and i 've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted , and so on and so on .
sb : no , not without .
this is what makes it so amazing .
we 're so used to thinking in terms of biology , we think about genes this way .
information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things .
a meme is not equivalent to an idea .
so , let 's see some memes .
all right everyone , who 's got some interesting memes for me ?
but some of them will be copied because they 're good , or true , or useful , or beautiful .
some of them will be copied even though they 're not .
it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human , all conventional theories of cultural evolution , of the origin of humans , and what makes us so different from other species .
the memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine .
let 's call them techno-memes or temes .
because the processes are getting different .
we put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet , but in order to get true temes and true teme machines , you need to get the variation , the selection and the copying , all done outside of humans .
we 'll think we 're choosing these things , but the temes are making us do it .
now , what about what else is going on out there in the universe ?
but what 's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators , one feeding on the one before .
just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy .
we may take the gaian view .
how many mothers do we have here ?
louise leakey talked yesterday about how we 're the only one in this branch left .
why ? because the temes are selfish replicators and they do n't care about us , or our planet , or anything else .
and why would they do that ?
so , those are the two possibilities .
but the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is , that third danger point , getting a third replicator .
so this became one of the driving passions of my life , to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems .
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers .
they can also autonomously build tensile structures .
one of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they 're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts .
now , there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question .
( laughter ) ( applause ) if the monospinner is an exercise in frugality , this machine here , the omnicopter , with its eight propellers , is an exercise in excess .
what can you do with all this surplus ?
because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled , there is really no limit to their number .
( applause )
he spelled moriarty with only one 'i ' .
you and i know deeper down , there 's always a chance to win the crown .
and so the fates are seldom wrong , no matter how they twist and wind .
he had the qualifications .
neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well .
we 're less likely to compromise , which means we 're not listening to each other .
and he gave his kids a communication project .
in this case , take a cue from journalists .
so forget the details . leave them out .
`` and calvin coolidge said , `` '' no man ever listened his way out of a job . '' '' ( laughter ) why do we not listen to each other ? ''
and look , i know , it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone , but if you ca n't do that , you 're not in a conversation .
`` he said , `` '' most of us do n't listen with the intent to understand . ''
she was the runner-up to miss america .
you do the same thing .
but it 's not that simple .
this is the complication .
guys , we have an issue .
growth has actually declined for the last 50 years .
and the first automation wave in the 1970s .
why did these manufacturing revolutions create huge growth in our economies ?
the idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand .
we 've made all the tweaks to the model that we could , and now we hit its limits .
just to name one : the internet .
these robots are working for us right now .
that 's real economic growth .
3d printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it 's now making its way through metal .
but actually , the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity .
we are now able to produce a batch of one product , your product , at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many .
scale does not matter anymore , flexibility does .
we need to reverse that and teach manufacturing again at university .
only the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth .
actually , it was not a sustainable model in the long term , as those countries are becoming richer .
this fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us .
if we play it right , we 'll see sustainable growth in all of our economies .
i make dictionaries .
and my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible into the dictionary .
`` so they say something like , `` '' because grammar ! '' '' ( laughter ) i do n't actually really care about grammar too much — do n't tell anybody . ''
audience : wugs .
`` but when it comes to words , they 're like , `` do n't ! no . creativity stops right here , whippersnappers . give it a rest . '' ''
and i 'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in english .
you can also take adjectives and make them into nouns .
`` and of course , you can `` '' green '' '' things . ''
you can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit .
( laughter ) another way to make words in english is to take the first letters of something and squish them together .
go ahead , start making words today , send them to me , and i will put them in my online dictionary , wordnik .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park .
this is a diagram of the u.s. counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan .
and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government .
`` i can sink my teeth into this . '' '' so let 's do it . so here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network . ''
at least one will .
but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that 's not reported here .
it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left — you have the stones — immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
this is not the common man .
but it 's something completely wrong .
( applause ) and this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
`` now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle , that in `` '' de anima '' '' — that is a very influential book for the western civilization — wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living . ''
some of them are much more sophisticated .
this is one , mimosa pudica .
they are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
so they need a vector — and this vector , it 's normally an animal .
this is a serious business .
and in the last paragraph of the book , it 's a kind of stylistic mark , because normally charles darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
here were have on the left , the internet and on the right , the root apparatus .
so you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [ continue ] to work .
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
`` `` '' jó napot , pacák '' '' which , as somebody here must surely know , means `` '' what 's up , guys ? '' '' in magyar , that peculiar non-indo-european language spoken by hungarians for which , given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet , few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago . ''
so , how do i explain this mysterious affinity ?
never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving .
once , as he had left instructions to have done , he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants .
and there , mr. teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .
`` `` well , i do n't rightly know , mr. teszler . i reckon that would be kings mountain . '' ''
`` they toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions , and inevitably the same question arose : `` is this plant integrated or what ? '' ''
`` and one of the white foremen stepped forward and said , `` '' you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business . ''
and on the first occasion that i visited his house , he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to .
`` whenever you hear this , i will be there . '' '' it was only after mr. teszler 's death that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale , new york was paid for by sandor teszler . `` `` jó napot , bela ! '' '' not long before mr. teszler’s own death at the age of 97 , he heard me hold forth on human iniquity . ''
and what they were arguing about was this : whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first . ( laughter ) mr. milliken said it was not . dr. robicsek disagreed .
as it does , i suspect , that of everybody here .
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband , orlando , and i and our family .
and i saw phyllis , and i watched her .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
i do n't know if he 's alive . i do n't know if he 's tortured .
`` i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . '' '' but she reached out to us in that way , and it was , i 'd like to say , it was an ice-breaker . ''
`` and i think it 's all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , `` '' hey , this was n't so hard . ''
( applause )
biologists , on the other hand , have got off lightly , in my view .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings , like the bow of a violin , to produce music .
it 's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .
luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
and this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [ to order and receive it ] .
( audience : yes . ) caroline phillips : i did n't hear you . would you like to hear it ? ( audience : yes ! ) cp : okay .
( applause ) this is a song that i wrote based on traditional basque rhythms .
( music ) thank you . thank you .
when i first heard this theme , i thought , well , embracing otherness is embracing myself .
and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me , and it 's given me an insight into the whole notion of self , which i think is worth sharing with you today .
is it who we really are ?
so this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up .
the self was not constant .
i was an anomaly , and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in .
because the self likes to fit , to see itself replicated , to belong .
and it is important .
another world was opening up around this time : performance and dancing .
i could be in the movement in a way that i was n't able to be in my real life , in myself .
by 19 , i was a fully-fledged movie actor , but still searching for definition .
`` so in africa , there 's been more time to create genetic diversity . '' '' in other words , race has no basis in biological or scientific fact . ''
on the one hand , result .
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection — and that thing is oneness , our essence .
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
i 've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior .
and over time and with practice , i 've tried to live more and more from my essence .
because , hey , if we 're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life , then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life .
simple awareness is where it begins .
but kennedy 's own words at rice university in 1962 provide a better clue .
why choose this as our goal ?
we choose to go to the moon in this decade , and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard .
`` technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in 1970 called `` '' accelerative thrust . '' '' for most of human history , we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail , but in 1969 , the crew of apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour . ''
they 've expanded and enriched our lives .
it mostly explains what 's wrong with silicon valley .
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
now , technologists , business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in energy research and development , and some kind of price on carbon .
but there 's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u.s. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus .
but 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution .
i 've spent my entire career in corrections , over 30 years .
i was not so much any of those things , and i 'm sure that worried him about me .
hundreds of men streamed out of their cells .
when i went to work at our receptions center , i could actually hear the inmates roiling from the parking lot , shaking cell doors , yelling , tearing up their cells .
my next assignment was to one of the state 's deep-end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed .
by then , the industry had advanced a lot , and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior .
and then we did something even more radical .
this was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique i 'd seen to that point .
and these were not huge system changes .
i interacted with a lot of people who were not like me , people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds .
one of them was a rainforest ecologist .
we talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they could n't complete on their own , like repopulating endangered species : frogs , butterflies , endangered prairie plants .
i was excited . staff were excited .
i do n't see my job as to punish them or forgive them , but i do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison .
so that was the question : could inmates live decent and meaningful lives , and if so , what difference would that make ?
remember , imus are for punishment .
what we found was a new kind of chair .
okay , we did n't forget our responsibility to control , but now inmates could interact safely , face-to-face with other inmates and staff , and because control was no longer an issue , everybody could focus on other things , like learning . behavior changed .
our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months , not years .
we 're learning how to do that .
thank you .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
we brought this raw data in and we filtered it .
what would that tell us ?
and we did n't know , for iraq what we were going to find .
so we looked at a few more conflicts .
what we 're saying here is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant , times the size of that attack , raised to the power of negative alpha .
we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world .
taking it forward , how do we change it ?
we can push it up : the forces become more fragmented ; there is more of them , but they are weaker .
so this graph here , i 'm going to show you now .
and we see the evolution of alpha through time .
and so i 'm thinking , right , great , it 's going to keep going down .
thank you .
and the way i 'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my poems .
and i 'm pretty much all for poetry in public places — poetry on buses , poetry on subways , on billboards , on cereal boxes .
and my sense is , it 's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life .
it wants only to be here tomorrow , dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt , nose pressed against the page , writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been .
( applause ) writing is not actually as easy as that for me .
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease .
`` he says that , `` '' if at first you do n't succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . '' '' ( laughter ) the next poem is also rather short . ''
poetry just says a few things in different ways .
( laughter ) and in that way we traded lore with each other .
`` it 's called `` '' the country . '' '' ( video ) narration : `` '' the country . '' '' i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house , because the mice might get into them and start a fire . ''
`` so the little poem is called `` '' the dead . '' '' ( video ) narration : `` '' the dead . '' '' the dead are always looking down on us , they say . ''
( laughter ) i mean , we had the wheel for some time .
first , the industrial revolution brought us machines and factories , railways , electricity , air travel , and our lives have never been the same .
so we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent ; they are brilliant .
today , nurses spend an average of 21 minutes per shift looking for medical equipment .
st. luke 's medical center in houston , texas , which has deployed industrial internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients , staff and medical equipment , has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour .
imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma , and needs the attention of several specialists : a neurologist , a cardiologist , an orthopedic surgeon .
ten years ago , that cost was 30 cents , six times as much .
and if she faces an unexpected issue , the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center , let them see what she sees , transmit data that they can run through diagnostics , and they can stream videos that will guide her , step by step , through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running .
unemployment is already high , and there is always a fear that innovation will destroy jobs .
and innovation is disruptive .
but let me stress two things here .
first , we 've already lived through mechanization of agriculture , automation of industry , and employment has gone up , because innovation is fundamentally about growth .
we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks .
and there were a few .
there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital , as it changed over time .
two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they did n't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene .
as we 've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased , we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care .
and vice versa , the best care often turns out to be the least expensive — has fewer complications , the people get more efficient at what they do .
because [ if ] to have the best results , you really needed the most expensive care in the country , or in the world , well then we really would be talking about rationing who we 're going to cut off from medicare .
we want the best drugs , the best technologies , the best specialists , but we do n't think too much about how it all comes together .
skill two is devise solutions .
the volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
so we did this .
we created a 19-item two-minute checklist for surgical teams .
we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle .
this was bigger than a drug .
in every field , knowledge has exploded , but it has brought complexity , it has brought specialization .
thank you .
this is the natural history museum in rotterdam , where i work as a curator .
back in 1995 , we got a new wing next to the museum .
the building was a true bird-killer .
both are of the male sex .
the live duck mounted the dead duck , and started to copulate .
well , i 'm a biologist . i 'm an ornithologist .
and here 's a rare picture of a duck 's penis , so it was indeed of the male sex .
that 's a good thing , so i accepted the prize .
( laughter ) so here 's my one minute of fame , my acceptance speech , and here 's the duck .
this is in montana , 2008 .
this is roadkill .
and as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world .
( applause ) oh , sorry .
something no student of anatomy could do without the help of visuals .
and this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations .
anatomy was caught in a struggle between science , art and culture that lasted for over 500 years .
a perfect example of this is spanish contemporary artist fernando vicente .
and this effect — also cool and tattoo-like — easily transitions into a medical illustration .
and this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world .
but for them , anatomy is n't just something to memorize , but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level ; to depict it in ways that we can relate , whether it be through cartoons , body painting or street art .
this is from virgin atlantic upper-class , it 's the cruet salt and pepper set .
`` what 's really , really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought , which is , `` '' i reckon i can heist these . '' '' however , you pick them up and underneath , actually engraved in the metal , are the words , `` stolen from virgin atlantic airways upper-class . '' ''
it starts with garage at the bottom , i suppose , appropriately , but it does n't go up garage , grand floor , mezzanine , one , two , three , four .
it 's a tiny , tiny thing .
and yet , what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there 's a very , very strong disproportionality at work , that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed , or the degree of force that 's applied .
`` so you walk for another hundred yards , expecting perhaps another sign , that might courteously be yellow , in front of you and saying `` '' trains . '' '' no , no , no , the next one is actually blue , to your left , and says `` '' heathrow express . '' '' i mean , it could almost be rather like that scene from the film `` '' airplane . '' '' a yellow sign ? that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting . ''
`` what can we do and encourage more online banking ? '' '' i said , `` '' it 's really , really easy . '' '' i said , `` '' when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at . ''
now , interesting that no single person does that , or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it .
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
that is actually strategy , and i 'm not denying that strategy has a role .
this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
but i 'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pedantic statements .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions .
at which point , you and your client have the ability to start considering what you 're going to put inside that vessel , the agency , the vision .
`` so , the first position we took was , `` '' hey , we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that does n't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company . '' '' the second issue is a nuance of the first . ''
and that 's that the company and the building was multiform .
it started to become hard to raise operational costs , operational budgets .
and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium .
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
the third configuration is a little harder to understand .
if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night , that would also be bad .
you 'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an intermission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .
it was very unusual .
here it is in a thrust configuration .
and last but not least , you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem .
et voila .
but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going , what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .
thank you .
indeed , one wonders that without a duty of care , how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before stevenson eventually went out of business .
tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers .
they 're not just less politically engaged .
a responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit .
we have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people .
but anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes .
well , i guess i am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and i to question authority , i do n't think they knew where it might lead .
but why is blood red ?
and from that slightly crazy question , over two decades and many campaigns later , including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war , from that crazy question , global witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners , investigators , journalists and lawyers .
and we 're all driven by the same belief , that change really is possible .
and much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices .
and juicy couture , home of of the velvet track suit , and other companies were the unwitting , unknowing tenants there .
but , for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system .
and nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company 's owner .
it might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual , but what about all of us , the public ?
so people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut .
and as they looked for the owners of the club , they found instead anonymous companies , and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies .
and the ted community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference .
it 's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning .
`` in 1962 , with rachel carson 's `` '' silent spring , '' '' i think for people like me in the world of the making of things , the canary in the mine was n't singing . ''
well , in my world , this is a rubber duck .
henry james would be proud .
so what are our intentions , and what would our intentions be — if we wake up in the morning , we have designs on the world — well , what would our intention be as a species now that we 're the dominant species ?
so we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work , but the question we bring to it is , how do we love all the children of all species for all time ?
`` if we come here and say , `` '' well , i did n't intend to cause global warming on the way here , '' '' and we say , `` '' that 's not part of my plan , '' '' then we realize it 's part of our de facto plan . ''
`` and so we call it `` '' cradle to cradle , '' '' and our goal is very simple . ''
so we realized we want full diversity , even though it can be difficult to remember what de gaulle said when asked what it was like to be president of france .
and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?
we 've seen the first form of solar energy that 's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the great plains , and so that hegemony is leaving .
here 's dr. venkataswamy in india , who 's figured out how to do mass-produced health .
we see in our material flows that car steels do n't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings — bismuth , antimony , copper and so on .
they become building steel .
my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington , among the first growth and big growth .

`` they said , `` '' they 're proprietary , they 're legal , go away . '' '' the only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by r.j. reynolds tobacco company , and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace . ''
`` when asked , they said , `` '' it 's kind of like a giant toilet that does n't flush . '' '' perhaps that 's away . ''
we 're adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
you know , most people do n't realize it comes from the latin competere , which means strive together .
it means the way olympic athletes train with each other .
they get fit together , and then they compete .
so when we see e equals mc squared come along , from a poet 's perspective , we see energy as physics , chemistry as mass , and all of a sudden , you get this biology .
the biological one i 'm sure you understand , but also the technical one , where we take materials and put them into closed cycles .
using those intellectual filters , we eliminated [ 7,962 . ] we were left with 38 chemicals .
so we need some help there .
shoes for nike , where the uppers are polyesters , infinitely recyclable , the bottoms are biodegradable soles .
here 's a building at oberlin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water .
here it is . it 's the world 's largest green roof , 10 and a half acres .
we lay out the building areas .
we inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors .
and so this is the existing city , and this is the new city .
the mother bears are usually killed .
and we were so unsure that this would work .
they only had islamic education , very little of it .
we were able to ensure brighter futures for these people .
this is what happens to the bears when they come in .
the big news that i want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of india , into our rescue center .
and the people can hold their heads up high .
and there will be no more removing of these bears .
now my topic is gratefulness .
we can be people who live gratefully .
it is n't as bad as it might seem .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
you open your ears . you open your nose .
but in fact , the majority were scared .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
there are lots of people who care about their freedom .
they probably have the best life in the world .
people did not believe this .
everything was done by the people to the people , and that 's the power of the internet .
`` this is not the end , this is the beginning of the end . '' '' i was detained on the 27th night . ''
i was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
and i did not really hear anything . i did not know anything .
i never had in my mind to see this egyptian , the amazing egyptian .
it 's actually strength — it 's power .
it was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what 's going on , regardless of the details .
we are going to win because we do n't understand politics .
and that 's not because of anything , but because we believed in our dream .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that 's based on technology trends .
but then it comes back . and sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream , and they 're going to burst out .
`` i 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my `` '' grand unified theory of predicting the future , '' '' but it 's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future . ''
the first is the critical price .
and what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it : home-theater units .
suddenly you have a dvd in the house ; you 've got high-quality digital video ; you have a reason to have a big-screen television ; you have a reason for dolby 5.1 surround-sound .
you can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the vcr .
there 's a company called apex , a no-name chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one dvd seller in america . their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars .
( laughter ) now they 've introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology 's life .
i 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our radar — and i 'll use this lens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .
it is now possible — will be possible , and if craig venter indeed comes today , he may tell you something about this — to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year .
that 's as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
what 's interesting is that at the same time , the number of genes that we 're discovering is rising very quickly .
each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .
now we 've switched to critical mass .
these are now technologies that are hitting critical mass .
i do n't know whether anybody has a prius 2004 , but they 're fantastic .
and if you look at the trends here , by about 2008 — and i do n't think this is a crazy forecast — they 'll be two percent of auto sales .
there 's a company created by the kazaa founders called skype .
look at these numbers . they launched it in august of last year ; they already have nearly four million registered users — that 's critical mass .
and the same thing 's happening on the carrier side .
free is probably the most interesting thing .
and here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive .
and you 've seen the numbers .
they 're facing a force that they have n't faced before .
thank you .
i brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time , and then while it 's still hot , add a couple of kilos of sugar .
i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigues me .
so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
`` so what i want to do is say to a future bug , `` '' spin me a thread . ''
what i 'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .
the second one was an hour , and then they became half hours , and all i noticed was my bald spot getting bigger .
and the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists .
so what i 'm going to show you is , in retrospect , a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time .
some work , and i 'll just go through these very quickly , a lot of sensory stuff .
it 's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace .
`` marvin minsky , who taught me a lot about common sense , and i will talk briefly about muriel cooper , who was very important to ricky wurman and to ted , and in fact , when she got onstage , she said , the first thing she said was , `` i introduced ricky to nicky . '' ''
it 's a pretty profound statement .
for me , it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public , and it also allowed us to build the new media lab , which if you have n't been to , visit , because it 's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work .
so these are the things we were saying in those teds .
and then something for me changed pretty profoundly .
very few people know that one laptop per child was a $ 1 billion project , and it was , at least over the seven years i ran it , but even more important , the world bank contributed zero , usaid zero .
the kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher .
there are no adults involved in this at all .
so i said , well can we do this at a larger scale ?
we 're going to be back and we 're going to play this clip 30 years from now , and then all eat the red pill .
after i was at dec , i went to work for a small company that made microprocessor-based electronic cash registers for the fast-food industry .
i was one of the few percentage of students who had a background in computer programming .
for halloween , i went dressed up as a calculator .
and he 'd use it to get feedback from customers and oks before he sent the job off to the presses .
it became pretty clear pretty fast that that was going to be too tedious .
the computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside .
`` the professor said , `` '' how did you do it ? '' '' well , i did n't want to tell him about our secret program . ''
most people did n't get it yet .
here 's that classroom .
`` it was done by dr. vince felitti at kaiser and dr. bob anda at the cdc , and together , they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called `` '' adverse childhood experiences , '' '' or aces . ''
for depression , it was four and a half times .
and that is wonderful if you 're in a forest and there 's a bear .
that 's what we do .
which is weird , because the data does n't bear that out .
i was free , i was happy .
it was a dimly lit shack .
now this was being broadcast live .
and i had become ashamed of the other , the african in me .
and there , i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
`` and i asked one of the voters , i said , `` '' whom are you going to vote for ? '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm sorry , i ca n't tell you . '' '' he said that his vote was in his heart . ''
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide , ghana honored democracy and its people .
the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .
while going to school in karachi and hyderabad , a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off , some to older men , some in exchange , some even as second wives .
it became enormous in just a few months .
media was connecting to us .
we were challenging centuries-old customs in those communities .
and number two , which was very important for me to learn , and amazing , and surprising for me to learn , was that we were not including the true heroes who should be fighting for themselves .
we are changing the policies .
we went back to the communities and we said we are very ashamed of what we did .
we know that it 's music , language , and embroidery .
nobody wanted to work with us .
we soon called this project sughar .
it means skilled and confident women .
all we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them , and that 's what we decided to do .
but then while we were thinking everything was going well , once again everything was fantastic , we found our next setback : a lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife .
she 's speaking more , she 's making decisions — oh my gosh , she 's handling everything in the house .
turns out the fashion industry in pakistan is very strong and growing day by day , but there is less contribution from the tribal areas and to the tribal areas , especially women .
ca : i love that when you talked about your team in the talk , i mean , you were all 18 at the time .
kb : people feel sorry for me , a lot of times .
but i think that 's the only thing that i 'm afraid of , and i do n't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night .
kb : yeah .
nathan and his boss saw this , and they could not tolerate it .
he went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community .
and when i think about what nathan did , and when i think about what people here do , i think about ideas .
i do n't know if you 've ever been to a jewish wedding , but what they do is , they take a light bulb and they smash it .
well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars .
because you do n't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition , where you 're talking about one thing instead of the other .
the internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
you 've got the organized armies over here .
every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking .
and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out .
not because you force them to do something against their will , but because they wanted to connect .
and that means that the idea you create , the product you create , the movement you create is n't for everyone , it 's not a mass thing . that 's not what this is about .
what it 's about instead is finding the true believers .
`` it 's easy to look at what i 've said so far , and say , `` '' wait a minute , i do n't have what it takes to be that kind of leader . '' '' so here are two leaders . they do n't have a lot in common . ''
what would happen if authors , or people with ideas could use version two , which comes out on monday , and use it to organize people who want to talk about something .
that most movements , most leadership that we 're doing is about finding a group that 's disconnected but already has a yearning — not persuading people to want something they do n't have yet .
bob marley did not invent rastafarians .
you just need a few people — ( laughter ) — who will look at the rules , realize they make no sense , and realize how much they want to be connected .
zappos is the one , the only , the best-there-ever-was place for people who are into shoes to find each other , to talk about their passion , to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow .
it 's exactly the same behavior though .
`` what it requires , as geraldine carter has discovered , is to be able to say , `` '' i ca n't do this by myself . ''
`` `` '' what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who does n't even own a pair of shoes ? '' '' this is not the story of how you get shelf space at neiman marcus . ''
they want to be missed .
and i hope you 'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
and in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
but , in my life , the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict — conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk .
i was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
they discovered that adult cells , taken from you and me , could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells , which they termed ips cells , or induced pluripotent stem cells .
indeed , we live in both challenging as well as exciting times .
as we speak , the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval .
`` it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there . '' '' and to prove it , she says , `` '' the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same , and i 'm going to prove it to you . '' '' she does this with cardboard , but since i have an expensive computer here i 'll just rotate this little guy around and ... ''
i 'll talk about that a little bit .
`` but murray gell-mann yesterday talked about emergent properties ; another name for them could be `` '' architecture '' '' as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious , non-simple ways of combining it . ''
not because it was n't beautiful or anything , but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology , and that is : why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?
so a more direct one , one that gives you more of the feeling of math , is something closer to pythagoras ' own proof , which goes like this : so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that c square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this .
`` `` what have you noticed about what you did ? '' ''
and i can try steering the car here by ...
so how do the children do science ?
ak : stopwatches are n't accurate enough .
teacher : drop . class : whoa !
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
we can take a movie of what 's going on , but even if we single stepped this movie , it 's tricky to see what 's going on .
`` so when the children see this , they say , `` '' ah ! acceleration , '' '' remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is . ''
`` and they say , `` '' oh , yeah . constant acceleration . ''
but if i oppose gravity , here we go ... oops !
you 're not robocop , and you 're not terminator , but you 're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices .
what does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
well , if you print it out , it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you 're carrying around all the time .
it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans .
so i started studying anthropology .
and so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
and it 's not that machines are taking over .
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it 's still a human connection — it 's just done in a different way .
and for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical .
and really you do the same thing .
it 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they do n't play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things — like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
i do n't see any reason why it should n't .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
this is a photograph of the object .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine — to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device .
so in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you 're in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
it 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
sir , you caught the giraffe .
audience member : 10 of hearts .
but he does n't have to be correct forever .
audience member 2 : the king .
hg : now , the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question , a number between one and 52 .
audience member 2 : 17 .
`` the old man only said one more thing : `` this is the end . '' ''
we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share .
and the reason why we do n't see them as often , it 's because we do n't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things .
so you have the giraffe , go ahead , throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random .
audience member 3 : i think so .
( laughter ) let 's make sure you have it .
do you have it ? perfect .
first of all , i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip .
first of all , take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill .
so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill .
now , very clearly , i 'm going to gather the deck together .
i 'm going to try .
i have some cards that maybe , maybe they do n't mean anything .
the queen of clubs !
we still have one foot in the dark ages .
well , it’s the relative importance .
the ocean representation would have a depth to it .
it features two of these deep rovers , and i can criticize them because these sweet things are mine .
it’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers ; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups , all our constraints — importantly , these two-dimensional constraints that we have , and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it — and we take them underwater .
and in a two-dimensional world , we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity .
this planet has an inner atmosphere of water ; it’s its inner atmosphere . it has two atmospheres — a lesser , outer gaseous atmosphere , a lighter one .
most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .
ok , this is good stuff .
this is the first flying machine . this was the first prototype .
but this lady here taught me , hah , taught me so much .
now , there she goes , right overhead .
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
but i decided not to have this treatment .
he was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
`` would we have thrown him out then ? '' '' we probably would n't have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we 'd probably have said , `` '' fantastic ! what a smart guy who is performing this low , '' '' because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could . ''
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
it 's called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
they 're perfect .
there 's no suggestion of a relationship there .
but if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society .
so income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them .
the measure we 've used , because it 's easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country .
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .
the average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth .
basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed .
we 're not just talking about a fluke .
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
again , quite big differences .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
this is just one example .
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
but i should say a few words about what 's going on .
i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected .
we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others , whether we 're regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing .
we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at , it goes into the analysis .
why do n't we control for other factors ?
what about causality ?
i should say that to deal with this , we 've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things .
( applause )
i use quotes or poetry .
i was born and raised in france , in paris , and i started learning how to write and read arabic when i was 18 .
`` it was a school , and i wrote on it a quote from nelson mandela , saying , `` '' [ in arabic ] , '' '' which means , `` '' it seems impossible until it 's done . '' '' then this guy came to me and said , `` '' man , why you do n't write in english ? '' '' and i replied to him , `` '' i would consider your concern legit if you asked me why i did n't write in zulu . '' '' in paris , once , there was this event , and someone gave his wall to be painted . ''
i was mad and disappointed .
i found out that it was a much more severe problem than i thought .
that is , if they do n't have to read anything too new or too different , they will manage .
and there they go , 80 % of the portuguese people .
so , how is this achieved ? how can you make the state and companies communicate with citizens in a language they can understand at first glance ?
how do we get there ?
but it is not . it 's a sign of intelligence .
`` `` '' someone wrote them . '' '' hum ? ''
but today i 'm not going to talk to you about this fear .
i 'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on .
i could n't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital .
some write blogs , some ignore it , some join protests .
i did all of it . in fact , that was what everyone was doing two years ago .
i logged on to a citizen journalism platform called ireport , and i recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in bangalore .
in that moment , a few things occurred to me .
some called me a victim , a rape apologist .
you see , as a writer , i approached this issue as an observer , as an indian , i felt embarrassment and disbelief , and as an activist , i looked at it as a defender of rights , but as a citizen journalist , i suddenly felt very vulnerable .
i mean , here she was , a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as i was , and yet i felt unsettled .
there is a big difference between linear and exponential growth .
in 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes , making them smaller and smaller . they finally hit a wall ; they could n't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum .
and i just updated these graphs .
`` because i had them through 2002 in my book , `` '' the singularity is near . '' '' so we updated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 . ''
`` and i was asked , `` '' well are n't you nervous ? ''
look at this graph here.you could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968 .
this is not moore 's law .
and all of this has fueled an increase , very smooth and predictable , of productivity .
and we 're all concerned about energy and the environment .
we ultimately will merge with this technology . it 's already very close to us .
based on that we are announcing , here at ted , in true ted tradition , singularity university .
it 's backed by nasa and google , and other leaders in the high-tech and science community .
but larry page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting , saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity .
the last third of the nine-week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity .
that 's another crevasse .
and that 's because everest is so high , it 's in the jet stream , and winds are constantly scouring the face , so no snow gets to accumulate .
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i 'll tell you about .
and , in fact , the wind does die down at night .
it 's the first part of climb .
the ones that could n't we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four .
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them , which is really not much , because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle .
the ones that were n't that lucid or were not that well coordinated , i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain .
but rob was now too weak to come down himself , and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude , he was just beyond rescue and he knew it .
( laughter ) he really said that . ( laughter )
so he was completely lucid , but he was very severely frostbitten .
so , as i was taking care of beck , he related what had been going on up there .
now , you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up .
and then , that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas .
he was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ; luckily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
it was able to land on the ice , take away beck and the other survivors , one by one , and get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp .
and we had a memorial service there a few days later .
these are tibetan prayer flags .
oecd countries , by and large , you should think about these as the richest , most industrialized countries in the world .
it should be noted , of course , that the united states and the u.k. are the next in line .
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time .
`` so for example , if i 'm speaking in english , i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about past rain , `` '' it rained yesterday , '' '' current rain , `` '' it is raining now , '' '' or future rain , `` '' it will rain tomorrow . '' '' notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events . ''
is this difference in languages only between very , very distantly related languages , like english and chinese ?
if that 's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present , that 's going to make it harder to save .
i 'm a professor , i get paid to have fanciful theories .
over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation .
let me show you how far you can do that .
if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ?
and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
now even after all of this granular level of control , do futureless language speakers seem to save more ?
thank you very much .
( applause )
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
it was called the sinclair zx80 . this was a 1k computer , and you 'd buy your programs on cassette tape .
actually i 'm just going to pause for one second , because i heard that there 's a prerequisite to speak here at ted — you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair .
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
`` some of the highlights were things like `` '' the terminator , '' '' `` aladdin , '' the `` teenage mutant hero turtles . '' ''
43 percent of gamers are female .
so there 's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware .
i liked this one the best : a level 60 warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars .
it 's very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
they 're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other .
we 're on this curve , and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better .
as man 's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays .
i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
some part of me — a true living , breathing person — has become programmed , electronic and virtual .
i played in the backyard , learned to read , and even ate some of my vegetables .
( music ) with the combination of simple , interactive stories and the warmth of the tv set , my simple 16-bit nintendo became more than just an escape .
( music ) i 'm a video game addict , and it 's not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
they know what makes me scared , excited , panicked , proud or sad .
as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away .
my fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands .
i know violent video games make my mother worry .
only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli .
consider this — my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it .
the sensory cues are very similar .
for my virtual worlds are perfect .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming .
what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics , sound , game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me .
i know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how flat the real world may seem to us , that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug .
`` the name of this track is `` '' the magic to come . '' '' who is that going to come from ? ''
that means there 's literally thousands of new ideas .
( laughter ) chris anderson : you 're off , you 're off . that 's it .
this is my daughter , her name 's emma , she 's 17 months old .
and as i 've shown here , we have the audience .
so i wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that 's designed in software .
so here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein , and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways .
what a fish .
`` `` best in the business . '' ''
no , not because i 'm some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
let 's call him miguel — actually his name is miguel .
he 's a biologist at veta la palma .
`` `` '' i know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : it 's amazing . ''
but what are your fish eating ?
`` they 're feasting . '' '' feasting ? i was totally confused . ''
well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
i almost never cook with it .
`` and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , `` '' hey guy , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? '' '' how are you going to feed the world ? ''
instead , they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep .
so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark .
this is indeed the true heart of the planet .
for example , garbage discharge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore .
it 's unbelievable .
in 2009 , when the u.n. reviewed progress , they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected .
this does not mean that it 's the final solution , or that this even provides permanent protection .
but the sargasso sea , the same way it aggregates sargassum weed , actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region .
but what i 'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection .
many species are headed through this region , which is why there 's been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
this is the initiative that 's been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area .
but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
we 've been revealing this information through technical workshops .
but many of you have said , if you get these marine protected areas , or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place , how are you going to enforce it ?
but not all the vessels have those to date .
it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate , if you 're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources , we need to know — someone needs to know — where you are and what you 're doing .
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .
at the same time , we need to think locally , which is the joy and marvel of sylvia 's hope spot wish , is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas , and to bring people to the table , if you will , to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management .
so , if you 're in the audience today , or maybe you 're watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
whether you 're an artist , a technologist , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life .
the system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there 's a match .
this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file , plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality .
and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube .
well , it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts , and that looked like the end of the story , but sometime last year , a young couple got married .
and instead of sony blocking , they allowed the upload to occur .
and they 've ended up on a bunch of talk shows , and they 've used it as an opportunity to make a difference .
two months ?
it 's basically a little ball of sugar .
if we had a platform , we might feel empowered to question : what if ?
it 's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food .
farming is hard .
where are they going ?
i wanted to make it bigger .
inside of these 60 square feet , we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month — not a lot of food .
i can tell you one thing for sure : this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything .
i have this weird tongue now , because i 'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until i 've eaten it first , because i want it to be good .
if you know about the genome or genetics , this is the phenome , right ?
those beautiful eyes are not being passed down .
`` and he says , `` '' oh . humidity is rain . ''
so , we 've open-sourced all of this .
it 's all online ; go home , try to build your first food computer .
we 're in the beginning , but it 's all there .
but we got a little too big .
this warehouse could be anywhere .
these exist , too .
the plants are producing the protein that 's ebola resistant .
but these two things look nothing alike , and that 's where i am with my field .
we start having beacons .
thank you .
my group , a couple years ago , started thinking : why do n't we do the opposite ?
it initially started with two grad students in my group , fei chen and paul tillberg .
now many others in my group are helping with this process .
and here we have some water .
they 're separated by distances that are around the size of a biomolecule .
we can peer inside and see the molecules within .
biomolecules are made out of the same atoms , but just in different orders .
so one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color .
and the cool part is , because those polymers are so tiny , we 're separating biomolecules evenly from each other .
we 're just making it easier to see .
so now we can take actual brain circuitry — here 's a piece of the brain involved with , for example , memory — and we can zoom in .
we can start to actually look at how circuits are configured .
can we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor so that we can actually go after it in a smart way and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to ?
we understood gravity ; we understood aerodynamics .
we knew how to build rockets .
( applause )
( laughter ) in their minds , my sexual orientation was america 's fault .
of course , there are gay people in asia , just as there are gay people in every part of the world .
if i had grown up in taiwan , or any place outside of the west , would i have found models of happy , thriving lgbt people ?
they told me their stories of persecution in their home countries , just for being gay , and the reasons why they escaped to the us .
they would be courageous , resilient , and most of all , proud of who they were .
they would be the kind of person that i aspire to be .
on december 21 , 2007 , the supreme court gave the decision for the nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage .
i ca n't be anything else .
on one hand , india is a hindu society , without a tradition of homophobia .
ld : there we met prince manvendra .
he 's the world 's first openly gay prince .
whether we are gay , we are lesbian , we are transgender , bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from , we have to all unite and fight for our rights .
now , this was a dreaded question that i got asked a lot by locals while traveling .
that is , until i showed her the photos of the supergays that we interviewed in india .
( laughter ) and in that ordinary afternoon , i had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country .
ld : from india , we traveled to east africa , a region known for intolerance towards lgbt people .
( video ) david kuria : at that point , i was really scared because they were actually asking for me to be killed .
argentina 's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as catholic .
yet , argentina has lgbt laws that are even more progressive than here in the us .
but they were fighting it out .
but there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world .
ld : one of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum , momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world , and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another .
who sends whom a text message ?
but deutsche telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c.d . inside .
and on the c.d. , this was on .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
but it is not only about me .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing . if you have access to this information ,
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
but you have to fight for your self-determination today .
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
i mean they 're incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one .
and so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .
this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
when it 's alone it does n't make any light .
the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
and so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand , and it 's got a pump that 's attached to its circadian rhythm , and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria .
and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
they make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule .
so then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we 've discovered .
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
`` they all have a species-specific system — they have a molecule that says `` '' me . '' '' but then , running in parallel to that is a second system that we 've discovered , that 's generic . ''
they either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it ca n't replicate its dna .
so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules — which you saw — but they 're a little bit different .
and so they lock into those receptors , and they jam recognition of the real thing .
by targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species-specific , or disease-specific , anti-quorum sensing molecules .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity .
the final thing is , again just to reiterate that there 's this practical part , and so we 've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
`` and then i thought , `` '' nah , that would n't be very nice . '' '' ( laughter ) that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it was n't just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself . ''
they did n't intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
i 'll come back to that later .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they 're not going to do it with tanks .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
i mean , everything off , it 's like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts do n't know exactly what 's going on .
and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that 's basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we 've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
it 's not that hard a problem .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
could we have fuel without fear ?
they 've enriched the lives of billions .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
so very efficient vehicles , buildings and factories save oil and coal , and also natural gas that can displace both of them .
but today 's energy system is not just inefficient , it is also disconnected , aging , dirty and insecure .
general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years , but then also make electrification affordable , and that displaces the rest of the oil .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
( laughter ) in one minute — and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
`` our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call `` '' institutional acupuncture . '' '' we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly , we stick little needles in it to get it flowing , working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon . ''
but the electrified vehicles do n't need to burden the electricity grid .
so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately .
in 2010 , renewables other than big hydro , particularly wind and solar cells , got 151 billion dollars of private investment , and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year .
well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and , combined with renewables , can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost .
but we only need to replace them once .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
portugal was 45 percent renewable powered , denmark 36 .
but that blackout risk disappears , and all of the other risks are best managed , with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect , but can stand alone at need .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
and i heretically suggested it could go down several-fold .
of course there 's still a lot of old thinking out there too .
and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure , this new fire is flameless .
( applause )
design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon , which has meant different things at different times .
and the bolder the dream , the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it .
and this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades .
put like that , it 's easy to see why edward teach and his fellow pirates could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design , and why their deadly symbol — ( laughter ) there 's more — why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones was a precursor of today 's logos , rather like the big red letters standing behind me , but of course with a different message . ( laughter )
moholy 's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever , but his approach to design was too experimental , as was his insistence on seeing it , as he put it , as an attitude , not a profession to be in tune with the times .
and sadly , the same applied to another design maverick : richard buckminster fuller .
now , it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design .
but i picked design , because i believe it 's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life .
he 's now developing not only the cardiopad , but other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions .
then there 's gabriel maher , who is developing a new design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities , without recourse to traditional stereotypes .
and we all stand to benefit .
well , i 'm an ocean chemist .
you can see an image of one of these corals behind me .
sometimes it increased very rapidly , then there was a plateau , then it increased rapidly .
the ocean stores huge amounts of carbon , about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere .
you 'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy .
to do that , we need to charter a research boat .
this is the james cook , an ocean-class research vessel moored up in tenerife .
it is global and it is deep , but we need to really find the right places .
this was a seven-week cruise , and this is us , having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks , but that 's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor .
we go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships .
most of the footage i 'm showing you is speeded up , because all of this takes a lot of time .
this is a beautiful holothurian as well .
this is a black coral called leiopathes , an image taken by my colleague , brendan roark , about 500 meters below hawaii .
if you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up , this is about 100 microns across .
we go in for these fossil specimens .
uranium is a very poorly regarded element , but i love it .
you can see the density of the surface water in this animation by ryan abernathey .
we do n't really know why , but we think it 's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water .
now there 's no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology .
there 's no other cause .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
the next day , the land looked like this .
now , the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds , and the larger the herd , the safer the individuals .
now , if it does not decay biologically , it shifts to oxidation , which is a very slow process , and this smothers and kills grasses , leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil , releasing carbon .
there is no other alternative left to mankind .
this was another site where it had been bare and eroding , and at the base of the marked small tree , we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil . okay ?
and again , watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature .
they put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
chris anderson : thank you . i have , and i 'm sure everyone here has , a ) a hundred questions , b ) wants to hug you .
dh : thank you .
bf : ... without a macarthur grant .
( applause ) dh : one more ? ( drum roll ) perfect . ( drum roll ) perfect . ( drum roll ) bf : ok. dh : oh ! all right . ( applause )
( laughter ) and now , all six cups . should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose ? ( laughter ) bf : first try ? once on purpose ?
bf : no , shut up !
what happened there ?
rw : do i get to hold them ?
actually , we will take a second to prove — this could be fake — that the blades are indeed razor-sharp .
dh : do you have a small farm animal ?
bf : yeah , a little sketchy .
dh : and turn up the intensity ; we 're still pink in the middle .
bf : all right ? oh my gosh . oh .
bf : i thought i had the hard part . ok .
dh : whenever you 're ready .
bf : there we go !
bf : it is , it 's weird . you would n't think it would affect half the stage , but it is . it 's weird .
( laughter ) you are my hero . you 're my jim shea , jr .
dh : where , barry ? where ? tell us , barry .
dh : whenever you 're ready there , big guy .
al gore : ten , nine , eight , seven , six ...
ap : ground control to major tom , ag : five , four , three , two , one ... ap : commencing countdown , engines on .
check ignition and may god 's love be with you .
ap : this is ground control to major tom , you 've really made the grade and the papers want to know whose shirts you wear .
`` tell my wife i love her very much she knows . '' '' ground control to major tom , your circuit 's dead , there 's something wrong . ''
you know , culture was born of the imagination , and the imagination — the imagination as we know it — came into being when our species descended from our progenitor , homo erectus , and , infused with consciousness , began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .
by the time the last neanderthal disappeared in europe , 27,000 years ago , our direct ancestors had already , and for 5,000 years , been crawling into the belly of the earth , where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles , they had brought into being the great art of the upper paleolithic .
`` he said , `` '' you know , clearly at some point , we were all of an animal nature , and at some point , we were n't . '' '' and he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt , through ritual , to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost . ''
but what do i mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence ?
and if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination , you enter the realm of tibetan buddhism .
it means things happen .
and so , when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in 55 years , you did not see a mad woman .
they said , at one point , you know , we do n't really believe you went to the moon , but you did .
take a direct north-south bearing , you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone , goes to the skyline , hits the heart of salcantay , the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire .
if those of you who are here remember that i mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood , but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary .
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers , and their prayers alone , maintain the cosmic balance .
their central metaphor is a loom .
the gourd is a feminine aspect ; the stick is a male .
there are four societies : the kogi , the wiwa , the kankwano and the arhuacos .
no , it 's not true that they 're kept in the darkness for 18 years , but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men 's circle for 18 years .
and then , abandoning all our gear , we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night , in a quite dramatic scene .
and it 's an amazing thing to think that this close to miami , two hours from miami , there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well-being .
they call themselves the elder brothers .
these myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new , failed attempts at being modern .
that shallow history should n't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
it also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
induction can heat , especially steel ; it 's very good at that .
so a microwave is a similar system .
so i put the specimen in , which i 'm now going to take out to see what happened .
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
so that 's what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that 's what we know from practice .
so we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine — this is the big version we have made to go on the real road — if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
and now you 're of course curious if it also worked .
so we still have the specimen here . it 's quite warm .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
we have about , you know , 38,000 places that are not worth caring about in the united states today .
public space . this is a good public space .
ok .
it 's not that complicated : buildings more than one story high , built out to the sidewalk edge , so that people who are , you know , all kinds of people can get into the building .
`` basically , a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state , emphatically , `` '' i 'm a little cabin in the woods . there 's nothing on either side of me . ''
`` i do n't have any eyes on the side of my head . i ca n't see . '' '' so you have this one last facade of the house , the front , which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house . ''
because — notice the porch here .
it is going to change absolutely everything .
forget it . it 's not going to happen .
soon , i started making a forest in the backyard of my own house , and this is how it looks after three years .
within two years of having this forest in our backyard , i could observe that the groundwater did n't dry during summers , the number of bird species i spotted in this area doubled .
quality of air became better , and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house .
for example , coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw , powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted .
by installing a small hardware probe on site , we can do remote soil testing , using which we can give step-by-step instructions on forest-making remotely .
by sharing , we can actually bring back our native forests .
and in past decades , we 've been taking those big ships out and those big nets , and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope , and we sort them , and then we put this data onto a map .
so we 've transformed our tiny hong kong classroom into a workshop .
and let me tell you , kids with power tools are awesome and safe .
and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits , we are going to collect only the data .
so what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem , or looking at a local problem , my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help , remotely , other kids .
[ i can investigate a remote problem ] so i was very compelled by doing the second experiments , and i wanted to take it even further — maybe addressing an even harder problem , and it 's also closer to my heart .
more than 14,000 people died in an instant .
and so we built the elevation map , we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity , and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall .
( applause )
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
there 's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people , possibly already once they 've been inducted .
the people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones .
she might have a bike , a video games console she only uses occasionally .
and you 're probably thinking — because you 're all very web-aware — yes , and we 're in the era of collaborative consumption , so she can go online and do all this .
`` she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed , she can go to taskrabbit.com and say , `` '' i want to do local deliveries , '' '' and so on . ''
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
it analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from .
what have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last 20 years ?
basically classified adverts with a search facility .
so why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading , and what the rest of us have ?
and it puts some obligations on those operators .
could we use the same model ?
so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility .
and government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets .
it does n't bother the taxpayer necessarily .
( applause )
this device consists of a large , round table and some machinery .
`` there was a paper published in the medical journal the lancet in england a few years ago called `` a man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for 5 years . '' ''
three years , four years , still smelled putrid .
it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think .
every year , we get in the neighborhood of 9,000 new nominations for the ig nobel prize .
you should know that when we choose somebody to win an ig nobel prize , we get in touch with that person , very quietly .
most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash , some money .
he looked through the records , and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts .
you add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around .
and then they wanted to be able to see , they needed light , so they 'd put in a light source , which in the 1950s was very hot .
she was one of the doctors who treated victims of the chernobyl power plant meltdown .
and that 's where the idea came from .
my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years , or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?
but that subdivides christianity , islam and buddhism into many subgroups , which was too detailed .
therefore at gapminder we made our own map , and it looks like this .
and here the income per person in comparable dollars .
so low income here , high income there .
japan here was regarded as an exception .
and when we enter into this century , you 'll find more than half of mankind down here .
i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
but there 's no major difference .
there 's no major difference between these religions .
but 30 years from now , afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million .
so what does it take ?
but let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at qatar .
and there are two billion children in the world .
these are rounded numbers .
i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
what ? ( laughter ) that really flipped me out .
turns out though , that that 's not even where it stops .
you 'll get to see , you can look away too if you 'd like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
`` they go , `` '' well , he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes . ''
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
i 'm sorry . if you 're getting queasy , look away , do n't look at the thing .
( laughter ) yes , there it is .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds .
those are the people i know , those are my friends and family , that is the majority of our society , that is you , that is me .
she did n't have to choose some p.c . stance on gayness over her heritage .
our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it 's not convenient .
believe me , we would rather have you ask .
i 'm a multitasking person , and i push my students to fly through a very creative , multitasking design process .
but how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
so what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure ?
now , i 'm not thinking about a distant future .
and now for the next few minutes , i invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us .
the computer universe is both marvelous and primitive .
you can see how these two worlds collide .
it 's remarkable to dream of this world , a world where technology truly understands us — where we live , work and communicate — with tools that enhance the human experience , not machines that limit our humanity .
first , as a machine , i would observe or i would input reality .
now , imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object , or better yet , imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force .
now here 's a secret : as an engineer , i get really excited anytime i can reduce something to the matrix .
and they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways .
jn : absolutely .
but for decades , we 've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards .
but we want the whole world to join us in taking the next , because this is not a journey for a few , but for all of us .
ak : thank you jeff , this was amazing .
( applause ) jn : thank you alex , bye bye .
we used to live in tribes where we interacted , communicated and worked together .
we are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today — technology that will let us stop living inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels , and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3d world .
so even if i wanted to cheat , i ca n't .
that 's the same as i get on this hololens as i will on that one .
come this way .
so what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you 'll use with the product at home , and then we store it , so that when there 's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this , between the camera 's hololens and the one on my head , we do n't have things disappear .
that 's my question for a hologram .
jn : thanks for the question .
i would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope .
there is still no electricity in my village .
i had a scholarship .
so now , i suppose , i do n't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today .
i just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
in real wonder , two years later , i was able to collect 50,000 u.s. dollars .
when i came home to gando to bring the good news , my people were over the moon , but when they realized that i was planning to use clay , they were shocked .
the innovation was to build a clay vault .
and see now , we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings , but we often do n't have so much material .
so we just bring them like you can see to the building site .
we start cutting them , and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete , and you have this result .
very simple .
that is it .
for sure , it has opened opportunities .
`` i just asked my mother one day , `` why do all these women love me so much ? '' ''
`` ( laughter ) she just answered , `` '' they are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community . '' '' i hope now that i was able to make my community proud through this work , and i hope i was able to prove you the power of community , and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future . ''
there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death , and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .
i was fascinated by this phenomenon , so i wondered : could one erase the image of diana , actually quite crudely and physically ?
momentum was being built .
i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery , so i started making reference to media imagery — made it grainy , shot through doorways and so on and so forth — to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .
i 'm particularly interested in how you ca n't rely on your own perception .
so , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ; what you ca n't have , you want more .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
because obviously the british public , i think , would prefer william to charles on the throne .
`` it 's obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little , `` shh — it 's not really them , '' was put on the side of the imagery . ''
it was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun — it was great for me to do a performance .
further imagery . i 'm making a new book now with taschen that i 'm working on really for a sort of global market — my previous book was only for the u.k. market — that i suppose it could be called humorous .
and sometimes asking the real celebrity , mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person , which is highly embarrassing . ( laughter ) .
the cheka was an instrument of the communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies .
at the beginning , every important step took place under the attendance of the russians .
foremost , it was its enormous power , because it united different functions in one organization .
it was founded to crash down protests and uprisings .
but what was even more typical for the stasi was the use of human intelligence , people who reported secretly to the stasi .
only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower .
the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political conviction and material benefits .
for this , the stasi owned 17 remand prisons , one in every district .
instead , he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central .
at first , i think there 's a difference of why you are collecting this data .
they are made for everybody , so it 's not allowed that any institution does n't respect the rules .
so i went out and researched ethanol , and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up .
if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute .
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
it looks like a car wash. you come into your car wash .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means — in the average consumer environment we 're in in the u.s .
in europe where taxes are in place , that 's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
first he let me go to the prime minister of the country , who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars — that 's what we needed in israel — i 'll give you country to invest the 200 million into .
three of them never showed up . one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount .
it 's got three centers — in brisbane , in melbourne , in sydney — and one freeway , one electric freeway that connects them .
we decided to come into the u.s .
in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses , but you also have the perfect range extender .
and the most fascinating thing we 've learned is that , when you have small problems on the individual level , like the price of gasoline to drive every morning .
so the price of oil , much like lots of other curves that we 've seen , goes along a depletion curve .
it 's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package .
that 's another 30 percent demand on oil .
that is another 25 million barrels a day .
that is the most pessimistic number you can have .
that 's an enormous amount of cars .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car — the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with — subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you 'll pay for the miles .
that 's one percent a year .
cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world 's co2 emissions .
i shared it with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr. , who is one of my idols .
( applause )
imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
i am going to speak about corruption , but i would like to juxtapose two different things .
i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa .
and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits : it had no clients , nobody would buy the electricity there , nobody was interested in irrigation projects .
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany , but also in france and the uk and scandinavia , everywhere , systematically bribed .
they needed help , and the large companies themselves have this dilemma .
this is what these other cultures demand .
and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing .
this case , they are not prosecuting in the uk .
civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the u.k. , and also in japan , which is not properly enforcing , and so on .
the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus ; under wolfensohn , they became , i would say , the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world .
the ku klux klan is an ngo .
( applause )
charlie rose : so larry sent me an email and he basically said , we 've got to make sure that we do n't seem like we 're a couple of middle-aged boring men .
larry page : well , thank you .
it 's still very , very clunky .
lp : yeah , so deep mind is a company we just acquired recently .
the computer 's on the left , and it 's just racking up points .
where are we , when you look at that ?
and so i think we 're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things .
i have this friend who really would like to expand his business .
when i met him next , he was going to put a windmill at the local school .
information is powerful , but it is how we use it that will define us .
( applause ) lp : now , the amazing thing about that video , actually , was we just read about it in the news , and we found this gentlemen , and made that little clip .
cr : when i talk to people about you , they say to me , people who know you well , say , larry wants to change the world , and he believes technology can show the way .
it has to do with languages .
and that 's how this project got going .
lp : yeah , but it turns out , we did some weather simulations which probably had n't really been done before , and if you control the altitude of the balloons , which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways , you can actually control roughly where they go , and so i think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet .
cr : before i talk about the future and transportation , where you 've been a nerd for a while , and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles , let me talk a bit about what 's been the subject here earlier with edward snowden .
i saw the picture of sergey with edward snowden yesterday .
we got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions , which there 's no data on today .
cr : so talking about the future , what is it about you and transportation systems ?
cr : and that began the idea of an automated car .
it 's just crazy that that 's what we use our space for .
cr : but you want to put them above the street , too .
lp : yeah , let 's show the video .
and i went and searched , and this is what i found .
and i 've been amazed , the more i learn about technology , the more i realize i do n't know , and that 's because this technological horizon , the thing that you can see to do next , the more you learn about technology , the more you learn what 's possible .
the principle of that for you is what ?
you are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well .
and i think , you ask , we have a lot of employees at google who have become pretty wealthy .
people make a lot of money in technology .
a lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy .
cr : when i close conversations with lots of people , i always ask this question : what state of mind , what quality of mind is it that has served you best ?
look at android .
i felt guilty about working on android when it was starting .
that was a good thing to be working on .
it was a store called draeger 's .
`` so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , `` is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? '' ''
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you 're considering their future financial well-being .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
( honk ) now who 's ready to go on this trip .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with people at ing — employees that are all working at ing — and now these people were all in a session where they 're doing enrollment for their 401 ( k ) plan .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
but you know what ?
here are two different jewelry displays .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we 've just got to take it a little easier .
engines , gearshift — four choices .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four gearshifts , to 56 car colors , high choice .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you 're getting overwhelmed , that means i 'm losing you .
it 's the same information . it 's the same number of choices .
all of these techniques that i 'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices — better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
thank you very much .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
`` i saw . `` `` what is that ? '' '' i asked . ''
you know , without them even calling , they 'll get a lot of women volunteers .
so far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
a school dropout from coimbatore , how he is able to sustaining ?
am : and previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . now , any rural woman can .
( video ) : ( singing ) you just think , competing giants , even from harvard , oxford , is difficult .
mahalakshmi is chasing me , i am keeping in the back pocket .
thank you very much . bye !
the first time i met with the prisoners , i asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop and they told me they wanted to put on paper all that they could n't say and do .
so i said to them why do n't we work with poetry , if they knew what poetry was .
they also suggested to me that the workshop should be not just for the inmates taking university classes , but for all the inmates .
many of the prisoners had n't even completed grammar school .
so we started looking for short poems .
so a new system appeared , new rules that made them understand very quickly , - very quickly - that with poetic language they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted .
and they have plenty of hell . plenty of hell .
it 's in this prison universe that you have all around you .
when the first year of the workshop had ended , we organized a little closing party , like you do when a job is done with so much love , and you want to celebrate with a party .
that was our simple party .
in prison there are things that ca n't be done .
poetry does that ; it sews up the wounds of exclusion .
`` they have to get into their heads , search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken away when they write and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison , and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space is the word `` '' bars , '' '' and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness when we light the wick of the word . ''
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean — i have to tell you — we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
here 's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
but some of them were not whale meat at all .
even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
but at least it 's labeled correctly , and you 're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
we 've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
they 're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we should n't tolerate that either .
they 're a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
and that pyramid in monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it 's ever functioned for the last 150 years .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
( applause )
it 's time to start designing for our ears .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
we 're designing environments that make us crazy . ( laughter ) and it 's not just our quality of life which suffers .
let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education .
noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years , and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there .
sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery .
education .
unfortunately , it was designed like a corporate headquarters , with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all .
old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
if you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments , sound absorbing materials and so forth , this is what you get .
if education can be likened to watering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sadly , much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing impairment .
i think the economics are pretty clear on this .
finally , we have homes . we use interior designers .
and this woman is the star of the video .
and that 's me right there in a brown coat .
i 'm wearing a hat . i 'm wearing a scarf .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
and i love that girl 's reaction so much .
and we 've continued to do it every year .
there 's a better photo of it .
`` and i told people , `` '' do n't work . do n't actually do work . ''
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
( laughter ) i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
`` and i 've never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , `` '' all those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . '' '' and of course they do n't . ''
we do n't need a reason .
`` they start with the phrase , `` a friend told me , '' and then they end with the phrase , `` is this true ? '' ''
and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they 've evolved for fundamental biological problems .
so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities , but that broad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health .
a lot of it did n't pan out .
it 's easy to bend .
but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid , it has to become difficult to bend .
because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend .
i was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
it had the central fluid , it had the surrounding wall , and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton .
the cloth 's cut on the bias .
so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices , and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves , which means the skeleton 's flexible .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
if the wall around the erectile tissue was n't there , if it was n't reinforced in this way , the shape would change , but the inflated penis would not resist bending , and erection simply would n't work .
`` so to sum up : twenty years ago , i had a college adviser tell me , when i went to the college and said , `` i 'm kind of interested in anatomy , '' they said , `` '' anatomy 's a dead science . '' '' he could n't have been more wrong . ''
( applause )
i did not feel that i could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street .
and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo .
no to violence : ramy essam came to tahrir on the second day of the revolution , and he sat there with this guitar , singing .
no to blinding heroes . ahmed harara lost his right eye on the 28th of january , and he lost his left eye on the 19th of november , by two different snipers .
no to killing , in this case no to killing men of religion , because sheikh ahmed adina refaat was shot on december 16th , during a demonstration , leaving behind three orphans and a widow .
another artist comes , paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank .
`` the message reads , [ arabic ] `` you can crush the flowers , but you ca n't delay spring . '' ''
it 's got breathtaking nature , waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see .
but the group i 'm most interested in is the swing hater .
why comedy ?
so i decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com .
it 's meant to generate a connection and laughter .
`` so the first question is , `` '' do we really have to change ? '' '' and of course , the apollo mission , among other things changed the environmental movement , really launched the modern environmental movement . ''
and we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space .
i 'm going to focus on the main one , but agriculture is involved , diet is involved , population is involved .
now it 's a big planet , but — ( explosion sound ) that is a lot of energy , particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day .
the hottest of all was last year .
these higher temperatures are having an effect on animals , plants , people , ecosystems .
and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths : deep , mid-ocean , the first few hundred meters .
it goes back more than a century .
and more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years .
super typhoon haiyan went over areas of the pacific five and a half degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into tacloban , as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall .
`` the brazilian scientists call them `` '' flying rivers . '' '' and they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours . ''
the insurance industry has certainly noticed , the losses have been mounting up .
this is systemic causation .
there 's so much extra energy in the atmosphere , there 's so much extra water vapor .
it dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of north america .
right now we 're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes ; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this .
and there are many factors because of it .
and this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now .
we have to move beyond partisanship .
so you get central bankers like mark carney , the head of the uk central bank , saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable .
we beat that mark by 14 and a half times over .
we see the cost coming down dramatically .
when 2010 came around , we beat that mark by 17 times over .
now , the business community has certainly noticed this , because it 's crossing the grid parity point .
the gap has been growing ever since .
`` `` '' how many can we sell by the year 2000 ? '' '' they asked . ''
there are more people without any electricity at all in india than the entire population of the united states of america .
so now we 're getting this : solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable .
`` so the answer to the second question , `` '' can we change ? '' '' is clearly `` '' yes . '' '' and it 's an ever-firmer `` '' yes . '' '' last question , `` '' will we change ? '' '' paris really was a breakthrough , some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot . ''
but nations are n't waiting , they 're going ahead .
china has already announced that starting next year , they 're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system .
all of them — canceled .
last year — if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the united states , almost three-quarters was from renewable energy , mostly wind and solar .
so , it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change .
almost 400,000 people marched in new york city before the un special session on this .
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced .
you 've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues , and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language .
ag : i think that the crossing — you know , i 've only been in the business world for 15 years .
turns out , it makes a difference if it 's cheaper than .
thank you !
on the field of battle , we are brave and noble warriors .
`` i cast my mind back when i was in second grade at a beautiful little government-run school called boronia park in the suburbs of sydney , and as we came up towards lunchtime , our teacher , ms. russell , said to the class , `` '' hey , year two . what do you want to do after lunch ? ''
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
but the third thing about prime numbers , mathematicians have always wondered , well at any given moment in time , what is the biggest prime that we know about ?
if you 've got that , you 're with me for the entire journey . okay ?
after that point , they thin out a lot .
( laughter ) euler discovered at the time the world 's biggest prime : ( 2 ^ 31 ) - 1 .
we did n't know for almost 40 years until frank nelson cole came along .
he went on and on and calculated 67 powers of two .
he had found the prime factors of ( 2 ^ 67 ) - 1 .
`` it took him , by his estimate , `` three years of sundays . '' ''
my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life .
in a roomful of maths ph.ds , i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
this is the first harry potter novel .
( laughter ) written out as a book , this number would run the length of the harry potter novels and half again .
( laughter ) i know what you 're thinking : adam , we 're happy that you 're happy , but why should we care ?
`` first of all , as i explained , to ask a computer `` '' is that number prime ? '' '' to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask . ''
it is true , you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess .
this is the cubestormer ii .
in our beautiful , indigenous sport of australian football , they won the equivalent of the super bowl .
and i was really lucky to go to the university of iowa where i could study under professor james van allen who built instruments for the first u.s. satellites .
but there were consequences .
the biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 argo floats were distributed around the world 's ocean .
the total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter .
a warmer ocean releases co2 , just as a warm coca-cola does .
most estimates are that , this century , we will get at least one meter .
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over 30 years ?
it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future .
several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm .
thank you .

`` ( laughter ) dr. gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the `` '' dragonball z : android saga . '' '' if you look very carefully , you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light . ''
many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis .
we do n't understand the code used by the brain .
and since i 'm realistic , rather than grandiose , i do n't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .
and second , just as in a radio broadcast , you can communicate with many receivers at once .
whenever a flash of light hits the receptor , the pore opens , an electrical current is switched on , and the neuron fires electrical impulses .
in this example , each electrical impulse , each deflection on the trace , is caused by a brief pulse of light .
they just stand around and groom excessively .
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .
this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that 's in the right half of the chamber .
through many such experiments , we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just 12 cells .
`` these 12 cells , as shown here in green , send the output to a brain structure called the `` '' mushroom body , '' '' which is shown here in gray . ''
in a situation like this , we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .
`` economic historians call this `` '' the great divergence . '' '' and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you . ''
and you can see here that there 's an exponential great divergence .
everybody did empire .
you may think we can explain the great divergence in terms of geography .
and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place with , notice , the same basic traditional culture , and we divided them in two , and we gave the northerners communism .
and i think i 'm the only scotsman here at the edinburgh ted .
and he said it such a long time ago .
but behind the icon , there 's complex code .
( laughter ) meanwhile , there 's no scientific revolution anywhere else .
the ottoman empire 's not that far from europe , but there 's no scientific revolution there .
the empires were n't all bad .
you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month ; i guarantee it .
japan was the first non-western society to embrace it .
max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant .
today , the average korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average german — a thousand .
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1500 — only faster .
this is the great reconvergence , and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime .
it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance .
`` he said , `` '' i do n't know ; i 'll have to think about that . '' '' that tells you something really important . ''
the europeans think that the american budget is going to explode tomorrow .
but it 's also , of course , to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage , excessive borrowing in the private sector .
it 's not about technology , it 's about people and stories .
i could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video : 60 minutes , many of you may have seen it .
so , they finished that . and i , as you can tell , am a bashful guy .
he 's literally , he 's got no shoulder on one side , and he 's high trans-humeral on the other .
there 's randy , these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them .
and just as in the spirit of first , gracious professionalism , they are quite proud of this , so they decide to share a drink .
`` but we 've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we 're doing the right thing . '' '' we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong . ''
so , we left .
`` and i was thinking , `` '' we did n't give them support and encouragement ; they gave it to us . ''
so , we went back .
and i started working harder , faster .
this kid was from staten island .
`` and i turned around and went , `` '' how are we going to do this ? '' '' ( laughter ) anyway , he was just like all the rest of them . ''
`` this is not a happy thing . look , if this happens to you , i can give you ... this stuff is still not as good at the original equipment . '' '' `` you need to come . '' ''
you know , this country is involved as we 've all heard , in this great healthcare debate .
who is entitled to how much ?
`` who is going to pay for it ? '' '' those are tough questions . ''
those are political questions , economic questions , strategic questions .
i was talking to one of them , and he was really liking this arm — it 's way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it — but there 's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .
but while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who 's paying for what and how much we get , the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining , i know what they deserve : everything humanly possible .
it has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients , gases and proteins .
that 's two-and-a-half times the earth 's circumference , inside you .
just imagine a very familiar scene : you 've been driving for 42 minutes .
biology would never do this .
just imagine .
what if in this train you did n't have to stop ?
as if walking in a city buzzing with drones , flying taxis , modular buses and suspended magnetic pods was not exotic enough , i think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing .
would we need traffic lights ?
they can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them .
then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test .
the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well .
in fact , there are many more applications of fibonacci numbers , but what i find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display .
now , it 's no surprise that when you add consecutive fibonacci numbers , you get the next fibonacci number . right ?
add 25 , we get 40 .
six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?
well , on the one hand , it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
just as we created it .
since we 've correctly calculated the area two different ways , they have to be the same number , and that 's why the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 .
now check this out .
how many would opt for memory ?
evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor 's take on the subject .
we have been here for about 130,000 years .
but what will come in the future ?
or , are we destined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
i was trying to preserve the body .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
the first is that we will not evolve .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable .
it 's not necessarily good for the society , but it 's what the individual and the family are choosing .
these changes are coming .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
what if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life — eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
and then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities — that better memory .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
in the exhibition that i was then in the absolute throes of organizing .
that 's a huge task . and yet , somehow he achieves it .
the move , in fact , back to an earlier life , one i 'd begun at the british museum , back to the world of three dimensions — of sculpture and of decorative arts — to take over the department of european sculpture and decorative arts , here at the met .
again , i 'd been there a couple of years before , but on that particular visit .
and i thought , on that very first day , i better tour the galleries .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
you know , so nouveau riche , frankly .
if you think about divans and perhaps even opium-induced visions of pink elephants , then at that point , this object starts to make sense .
and again , going on thinking about this , i realize that in a way we 're all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another , or are deemed to do so .
redolent , in a sense , of science fiction , turning london into a kind of fantasy playground .
in fact , reader , i married him . i bought him .
i love his orange and pink breeches .
he 's , i hope , a little bit dignified , but mostly rather vulgar . ( laughter ) and energetic , i hope , too .
and before that leonardo , i understood that this object could become part of a journey for me every day , sitting in my office .
thank you very much .

but few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it , if , indeed , there was any human agency involved in its creation , if it did n't just sort of materialize out of the software ether .
i ca n't stand it . nor can chris .
well , i tell a lie .
a lie at ted . i 'm really sorry .
but there is a bit more to it than that .
i was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this 18-unit box .
clearly i could make more variants , but would these three members of the family be better ?
the phone book . i 'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia .
designed for the phone books , as i said , to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high-speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack .
so the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions .
i had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper — there were four weights of bell centennial — pixel by pixel , then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard .
but here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me .
i persevered .
i 've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems .
so i was persuaded , i was convinced , and we went to work on what became verdana and georgia , for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up .
the bitmap looks jagged and rough .
there are a couple options , but plan a was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes .
if they were right , it would basically solve the problem that he and james had been working on for 20 years .
so if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is ab , where b is the anti-malarial gene , the babies should come out in four permutations : aa , ab , aa , ba .
biologically , that should n't even be possible .
many of you have probably heard about crispr , so i 'll just say briefly that crispr is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely , easily and quickly .
ok , remember how i said that gene drives originally had two problems ?
the same goes for dengue fever , chikungunya , yellow fever .
he bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab and he also used a species that 's not native to the us so that even if some did escape , they 'd just die off , there 'd be nothing for them to mate with .
if that happens , it 's possible a gene drive could cross over , like asian carp could infect some other kind of carp .
first , you 'd have to figure out which genes control what the fly wants to eat , which is already a very long and complicated project .
so if you 're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out , or just blowing stuff up ?
ok , so where does this leave us ?
i 'm not sure i 'd say that .
that 's great .
what if kenya wants to use a drive but tanzania does n't ?

i mean , i watch oprah mostly when i 'm home in spokane visiting my mother . and to my mother , oprah is a greater moral authority than the pope , which is actually saying something because she 's a devout catholic .
anyway , i like oprah — i like her girlfriendy-ness , i like her weight issues , i like how she 's transformed talk television , i like how she 's brought reading back to america — but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... i call it the soon-yi moment : it is the moment when i can not continue supporting someone .
and the basic idea is that there 's this law of attraction , and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you .
and on this axis , i 'm showing dollars per person in income .
now , what has happened ?
and almost the same happens here .
25 years it took .
it means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of california — every person , that 's more or less what we have today in the world .
they started low , they skyrocketed , they peaked up there in 2003 , and now they are down .
we have to stop that .
( applause ) i had the fortune to live and work for a time in the united states .
i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different .
and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo — they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful zambia — much higher .
so , is it poverty ?
but that 's very simplistic , so let 's go down and look at tanzania .
i 've split kenya in its provinces .
hiv exists all over the world .
look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
india has many because they are many .
it could be concurrency .
it could be some virus types .
it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
in sweden , we have no concurrency .
it 's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease , with severe tremor , with severe pain .
however , neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair .
and to do that , you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain .
and after many attempts , jean-françois did it .
why ?
they come from these cells .
all of you have them in your brain .
when you were fetuses , they helped your brain to fold itself .
the idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain , and then to culture the cells exactly the way jean-françois did it in his lab .
and the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual .
so in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
and that 's the image of what we could observe under the microscope .
bg : jocelyne , thank you for coming to ted and sharing this .
maybe you 're a roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you 're a zulu warrior .
they went and searched dreyfus 's apartment , looking for any signs of espionage .
so the case went to trial , and dreyfus was found guilty .
and they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named devil 's island , which is this barren rock off the coast of south america .
so there he went , and there he spent his days alone , writing letters and letters to the french government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence .
and this is ubiquitous .
`` so he brought these discoveries to his superiors , but to his dismay , they either did n't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings , like , `` '' well , all you 've really shown , picquart , is that there 's another spy who learned how to mimic dreyfus 's handwriting , and he picked up the torch of spying after dreyfus left . ''
but it took him 10 years , and for part of that time , he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army .
and i 've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset .
he felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman .
essentially , toymakers took the bear from the cartoon , turned it into a plush toy , and then named it after president roosevelt — teddy 's bear .
because think about the teddy bear .
but it 's not all physical , right ?
there 's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals , and we 're telling stories about these animals , and like all stories , they are shaped by the times and the places in which we 're telling them .
`` everyone can use corn juice for cars . from fritz . '' '' so 200 years ago , you would have arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them , even if they lit the bear on fire , but these kids do n't see the polar bear that way , and actually they do n't even see the polar bear the way that i did back in the '80s . ''
but look now how quickly that climate change has flipped the image of the animal in our minds .
so you would have a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes , and then sometimes they 'd leave the big tail on it like a big , meaty noodle .
the one brought to taft 's table weighed 18 pounds .
so we can explain that failure two ways .
we monitor pygmy rabbits with drones .
well , the ones that we 've told compelling stories about , the ones we 've decided ought to stick around .
so what i 've been saying is that the stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized .
our imagination has become an ecological force .
and so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of roosevelt and that bear in mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then .
nasa uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts , and last year , they invited us along for the ride .

now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society , because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage : in politics and economics , in religion and tradition , in gender and generations .
audience : sex .
audience : sex .
audience : sex .
although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity , in a patriarchy , boys will be boys .
not so for women , who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night — that is , to turn up with your hymen intact .
and so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy — from female genital mutilation , to virginity testing , to hymen repair surgery .
in egypt , where my research is focused , i have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel .
and they face a daily struggle with social stigma , with family despair , and with religious fire and brimstone .
they have been sold by their families , often to wealthy arab tourists .
today 's sexual landscape looks a lot like europe and america on the brink of the sexual revolution .
`` `` '' just say no '' '' is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo . ''
but history shows us that even as recently as our fathers ' and grandfathers ' day , there have been times of greater pragmatism , and tolerance , and a willingness to consider other interpretations : be it abortion , or masturbation , or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality .
but i am optimistic that , in the long run , times are changing , and they and their ideas will gain ground .
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again .
now , sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes .
and the answer is , perhaps , that you use these guys , bacillus pasteurii , a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes , and does precisely that .
it takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it .
so , how much would this cost ?
then , a few years afterwards , using permacultural strategies , we green that part of the desert .
so , we pushed the piles down through the dune , and we create an initial bacterial surface .
and i realized that if i scaled them up , they would provide me with good spatial qualities , for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things .
and i think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually .
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .

all right , those of you , i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage .
all right , who has an answer for charlie ?
they said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise .
the fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
it 's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority 's opinion .
on the face of it , it seemed to be — this debate about the golf cart — an argument about fairness , what 's an unfair advantage .
why ?
because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , relatedly , the question : what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ?
let me put the point as delicately as possible : golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
thank you very much .
in the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .

this was about 1925 .
well , to describe our profession otherwise , we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty .
my first exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 — that the hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
and finally , i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully , that i had behaved morally , and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers , rail-diggers , oven-setters , chimney sweeps and potters .
first i set up a shop in my own garden , and made pottery which i sold on the marketplace in budapest .
and the first day , i was coming to take my place at the turntable — there were three or four turntables — and one of them , behind where i was sitting , was a hunchback , a deaf-mute hunchback , who smelled very bad .
( laughter ) after i brushed them off with a hand motion , they were very — i finally was now accepted , and worked there for some six months .
and actually , my work took me to many countries because i used my work to fill my curiosity .
but since i survived and i 'm here , and since this is the end of the five minutes , i will — moderator : tell me when your last trip to russia was .
were n't you there recently ?
they found out that i had worked in '33 at this factory , and they came to my studio in rockland county , and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here .
if you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us .
and i wish godspeed to aubrey de grey , and other people like him , to try to do something about this as soon as possible .
existential risk is a threat to human survival , or to the long-term potential of our species .
well , let 's first look at the probability — and this is very , very difficult to estimate — but there have been only four studies on this in recent years , which is surprising .
he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century : 50 percent .
every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best .
here are a number of things that we do n't want — illness , involuntary death , unnecessary suffering , cruelty , stunted growth , memory loss , ignorance , absence of creativity .
we were very successful .
we got rid of all of these things .
or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards ?
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they do n't really transform what it is to be human .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .
as far as i can see , all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room , so that 's a great thing .
it 's possible to assume , setting aside a possibility of catastrophe , that sooner or later we will develop all of these .
but part of the reason — and that 's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these — is that they 're also intrinsically valuable .
now , the human mind is not a single unitary information processor , but it has a lot of different , special , evolved modules that do specific things for us .
it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this .
this is the last picture that i want to — now we 've got to use the laser pointer .
what are the dates again ?

well thank you so much . that was a gorgeous treat for us .

i believe in randomness , and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .
and i 'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy .
and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot , and sure enough , i failed .
`` and i , one day , i announced this to my parents — and my father denies this story to this day — i said , `` '' daddy , i want to be a diplomat . '' '' and he turned to me , and he said , `` carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . '' ''
being a diplomat , then and now , is an incredible job , and i loved every minute of it — i enjoyed the status of it .
later , i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban .
and that was exciting — that was fun .
and the pinnacle of my career , as it turned out , was when i was posted to new york .
and there , i dealt with things like the middle east peace process , the lockerbie issue — we can talk about that later , if you wish — but above all , my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .
i was the chief british negotiator on the subject , and i was steeped in the issue .
i decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the new school , bruce .
secondly , the government had ignored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still .
what was i going to do ?
but , in a way , i 've got used to the sensation of it .
i wanted to be an ambassador , and my mentors , my heroes , people who got to the top of my profession , and here i was throwing it all away .

when i realized this , and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars , and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council were n't actually there , were n't actually invited to give their views to the security council , i thought , this is wrong .
it 'll be great . you can have an exchange .
and i thought , i 'm buggered if i 'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done .
they are a graphical visualization of a character .
if i push chris a bit , like this , for example , he 'll react to it .
it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment , at all .
if you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
( laughter ) so , it was back to the drawing board for us .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
that was the real breakthrough for us .
what you see here is the character standing there , and there 's an obstacle that we put in its way .
it 's going to turn around into the fall , and try and catch the fall .
and then , finally hits the floor .
what this is now is a real simulation . that 's what i want to show you now .
this is the first time the public sees this as well , because we have been in stealth mode .
i have n't shown this to anybody yet .
( laughter ) and this is what happens . ( laughter )
because stunts are obviously very dangerous , they 're very expensive , and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you can not do , obviously , because you ca n't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt .
so , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
this is not a dead body . this is a body who basically , in this particular case , feels the force and tries to protect its head .
animators had to actually animate them .
now , one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene , and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is caught by a bungee .
got a very short clip here .
there 's very often very surprising behavior that you did n't predict before .
the classic quote is , i think , it 's unpredictable at best , is what people think right now , is the outcome .
so , you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter-balance .
so it 's just — ( applause ) thanks .
now , programming , for those of you here that have n't done it yourself , requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal .
now , if you want to do something that you do n't know how to do yourself , then this is going to be a great challenge .
so he came up with an idea : he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers .
so from this vantage point , i was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
companies like amazon and netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy , movies that you might like to watch .
so important was this that in fact the success was covered in the new york times in a front page article a few weeks later .
this is better than people , again .
imagine how long it would have taken before : dozens of people , many years .
baidu is kind of the chinese google , i guess , and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that i uploaded to baidu 's deep learning system , and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images .
complex , nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms .
these are pictures which have no text attached , and as i 'm typing in here sentences , in real time it 's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they 're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that i 'm writing .
now this system is now only two weeks old , so probably within the next year , the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going .
so computers can also write .
and thankfully , the feedback has been fantastic , not just from the media but from the medical community , who have been very supportive .
so these images are entirely unlabeled , so i have to start from scratch .
in this case , it got kind of confused .
so we do that for a while , we skip over a little bit , and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things , and we hope that it 's gotten a lot better .
so we can again give the computer some hints , and we say , okay , try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm .
so imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches ?
for example , these four algorithms were all built by the same guy .
so if you think , oh , it 's all happened before , we 've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs , what are these new jobs going to be ?
and as we started talking to more people about it , more people wanted to hear about it .
and we 've all heard that kind of story before , right ?
and importantly , it is .
the first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012 , and it 's already generated over three billion dollars of private-sector investment .
think about it .
are we stuck with rampant urban displacement , with environmental degradation ?
this is more than just infrastructure .
the market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum often include the seemingly unstoppable and inevitable cycle of rising taxes , prices and rents .
this is hard , and it wo n't happen on its own .
we wanted to engage them , to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves .
and we succeeded .
you can watch them any time you want .
this motivated the students to keep going , and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time , so if you went into a discussion forum , you could get an answer from a peer within minutes .
and finally , from teach for america , i learned that a class is not primarily about information .
now , the class ran 10 weeks , and in the end , about half of the 160,000 students watched at least one video each week , and over 20,000 finished all the homework , putting in 50 to 100 hours .
sebastian 's teaching another class now .
stanford coursera , udacity , mitx and others have more classes coming .
it 's a really exciting time .
and you 'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that 's available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
now on to the detection algorithms .
with neutral , there 's nothing in particular that evan needs to do .
he just hangs out . he 's relaxed .
so let 's see if evan can actually try and imagine pulling .
okay . let 's try that .
`` and the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about `` '' disappear . '' '' as there is a machine learning algorithm in this — ( applause ) thank you . ''
so , as you can see , before , there is a leveling system built into this software so that as evan , or any user , becomes more familiar with the system , they can continue to add more and more detections , so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
in this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .
man : now blink right to go right .
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m .
it is , as you can see , very small and also very cheap .
this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device — among early adopters at the moment — the fitbit .
this is a beautiful , new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data , not just whether you 're asleep or awake , but also your phase of sleep — deep sleep , light sleep , rem sleep .
what is this for ?
some people will say it 's for avant-garde marketing research .
there was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter .
of course , the cage was salvaged .
it 's not good .
this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing .
and those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
i 'm not going to talk too long about it , but there are so many of the family of uce , which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest , that still have to go through that process .
as you can see there 's only yellow terrain .
in 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there .
we have 30 species of reptiles .
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control , whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .
and after eight years they might actually yield some timber — that is , if you can preserve it in the right way , which we can do with bamboo peels .
so the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
this is an area of about 50 million hectares .
may .
so these fires are really the first things to work on .
and you need the local people for that because these grasslands , once they start burning ... it goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall — going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there .
and you can create so much energy from this — they produce three times more energy per hectare per year , because you can tap them on a daily basis .
so , just like nature , we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that , we grow the slower growing , primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light . then , what is just as important : get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours .
and we do a lot of work here .
that you can go from this zero situation , by planting the vegetables and the trees , or directly , the trees in the lines in that grass there , putting up the buffer zone , producing your compost , and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
and that 's green . if you look from the tower — this is when we start attacking the grass .
and all these species and income .
we can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology .
and look at these images .
and if we look at the rainfall pattern above samboja lestari , it used to be the driest place , but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there .
so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do , because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies .
and after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
there is no simple one recipe for one place .
they get building material for houses , a contract for selling the sugar , so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally .
on january 4 , 1934 , a young man delivered a report to the united states congress that 80 years on , still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today , still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet .
but first , we have to understand how gdp came to dominate our lives .
these are questions that gdp does not and can not answer .
secondly , does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives : education , information , health and sustainable environment ?
( applause ) well done ! never been ; must go .
let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world , the 132 we 've been able to measure , each one represented by a dot .
now , my slide is getting a little cluttered and i 'd like to step back a bit .
here 's brazil : social progress of about 70 out of 100 , gdp per capita about 14,000 dollars a year .
brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning gdp into social progress .
but that is only half a plan .
we do n't want brazil to become like russia .
and what that means is that brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it 's not just growth alone , it 's growth with social progress .
and here are the results , and this is broken down into nearly 800 different municipalities .
to face those challenges , we need new tools of measurement , new ways of valuing progress .
imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution , but on their contribution to social progress .
imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people 's lives .
in england the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly , because they 've re-branded unemployment .
there 's an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs .
it 's an interesting question .
i 'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax .
i think that 's true actually .
we merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model .
and what that means is that in looking at solutions , we 've probably given too much priority to what i call technical engineering solutions , newtonian solutions , and not nearly enough to the psychological ones .
red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
this is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics .
the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
this is a toll crossing in britain .
quite often queues happen at the tolls .
you could apply the same principle actually , if you like , to the security lanes in airports .
here 's a guy you all need to study .
i think the danger we have in today 's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology .
but von mises , among many other things , i think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing , the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value .
if however , you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat , you were n't actually creating value , you were exploiting the shepherd .
that 's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks .
what you need to do is first of all tell people that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day , first-class mail .
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted .
it 's my first year as a new high school science teacher , and i 'm so eager .
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
if — ouch is right ! — if you see this , and you 're a bacterium , this is like your worst nightmare .
because , you see , dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make .
they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and — bam ! — all of the dna pops out .
there are two ways : on the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells .
but if you 've graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before .
but i bet it was presented in a way that it did n't exactly stick in your mind .
this is horrifying .
`` it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody cares about , where you 're like , `` '' oh , i met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these ugly jeans . ''
we have to convince our audience that what we 're talking about matters .
and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube .
now i eat whenever i 'm hungry , and i 've lost 10 pounds .
you can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range , but it 's much , much harder to stay outside of it .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
this may explain a very sad fact : set points can go up , but they rarely go down .
even after you 've kept the weight off for as long as seven years , your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back .
controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising , super-sizing , and the all-you-can-eat buffet .
children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range .
in fact , if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits , you can see that weight makes very little difference .
you can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle , even if you ca n't lose weight and keep it off .
i 'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga .
think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
let 's face it : if diets worked , we 'd all be thin already .
( laughter ) why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results ?
in the u.s. , we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they 've been on a diet .
what if we told all those dieting girls that it 's okay to eat when they 're hungry ?
what if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it ?
please keep your seat .
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather , and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
it was cadaverically cold to the touch .
and when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
so people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
these cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
what can we do in a case like chandler 's ?
it 's successful , as you can see from this video of chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
( laughter ) well , ha , ha , ha ! all the laughs are on me .
we 're asking questions to computation that have no single right answers , that are subjective and open-ended and value-laden .
and the system learns by churning through this data .
it 's a problem when this artificial intelligence system gets things wrong .
they thought that this would make hiring more objective , less biased , and give women and minorities a better shot against biased human managers .
they can infer your sexual orientation , your personality traits , your political leanings .
they 're not depressed now , just maybe in the future , more likely .
( laughter ) look , such a system may even be less biased than human managers in some ways .
they dropped it , they walked away , but they were arrested .
she had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors .
there 's no right answer .
in august of 2014 , protests broke out in ferguson , missouri , after the killing of an african-american teenager by a white police officer , under murky circumstances .
`` ( applause ) artificial intelligence does not give us a `` '' get out of ethics free '' '' card . ''
we need to make sure we have algorithmic accountability , auditing and meaningful transparency .
`` we 'll start with something very simple — newton 's law : `` the force equals mass times acceleration . '' ''
so if we take an example — ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth .
and there are parallels for marketing — you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief .
think about toyota .
this says that entropy , which is a measure of the disorder of a system , will always increase .
i actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
the wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind .
we would have no pains , but also no joys .
this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate .
i do n't believe that , and i think the situation is changing .
these are images that come from hanna damasio 's lab , and which show you , in a living brain , the reconstruction of that brain .
and this is a person who is alive .
so all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons , the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses .
and we could take a very simple view and say , well , it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams , or when we go under anesthesia , and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia .
but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia , or when we are in deep , dreamless sleep ?
that flow of mental images is mind .
so if i cover my left eye — i 'm talking about me personally , not all of you — if i cover my left eye , i look at the grid — pretty much like the one i 'm showing you .
if i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner , what i get is the following .
and of course , the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina .
and in that image there , you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain .
so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is .
so far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images .
so for example , i 'm making images of you , but there 's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my brain .
this is so specific that , for example , if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem , if you damage that as a result of a stroke , for example , what you get is coma or vegetative state , which is a state , of course , in which your mind disappears , your consciousness disappears .
so what is the picture that we get here ?
you have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non-serendipitous way if you do not know how this works .
so that 's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we 're doing , and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains .
( music ) ( video ) narrator : on this planet , 1.6 billion people do n't have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels .
this is a problem .
it impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life .
they can run upside down very rapidly on rods , branches and wires , and if you perturb one of those branches , they can do this .
and i point out that all of these videos are slowed down 20 times , so they 're actually really fast , when you see this .
bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
the world bank projects by 2011 , it will be under 20 million , which is a reduction of 95 percent .
being from the massachusetts high-tech community myself , i 'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s , although we hung around harvard square .
but if you ask me , what will it cost for one mips of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 , or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
they think they 're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today 's tools , at today 's pace of progress , and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth .
so we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems .
now this is an interesting chart , and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process — and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes — accelerate .
so the cambrian explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
we always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation .
and we 've had a continual acceleration of this process .
i put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph — by the way , a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth — that 's another exponential .
it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 , two years in the middle ; we 're now doubling it every one year .
you could buy 10 million in 2002 .
it 's pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is .
unlike gertrude stein 's roses , it 's not the case that a transistor is a transistor .
`` this is due to greater productivity , but the economist says , `` '' but there 's no way you 're going to be able to keep up with that . ''
we 're understanding the software programs that make our body run .
we were evolved in an era where it was n't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference , like myself , to live much longer , because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them .
for example , we can inhibit genes now with rna interference .
another major revolution : the communications revolution .
and this is less futuristic than it may sound .
there 's actually one going into human trial , so this is feasible technology .
this is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well — in applying psychoacoustic tests , gets very similar results to human auditory perception .
there 's another simulation of the cerebellum — that 's more than half the neurons in the brain — again , works very similarly to human skill formation .
you might wonder , well , was n't there a boom and a bust ?
these are very powerful technologies .
a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank , it 's an investment bank ; it has 15 to 20 times .
( laughter ) it ai n't pretty .
and we were n't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030 .
and then all bets are off .
and that 's what happens to currencies when you do n't stand behind them .
it makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to alaska in the overall scheme of things .
so what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that 's a monster that 's simply going to eat the entire budget .
i got what you 're thinking .
( laughter ) here 's what happens if you do n't address this stuff .
so , japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '80s .
we do n't fix this now , how would you like to see a dow 3,500 in 2026 ?
and what 's really important in this stuff is , as we cut , we also have to grow .
among other things , because startup companies are .02 percent of u.s. gdp investmentm and they 're about 17.8 percent of output .
they just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards .
so , cells have this cycle .
two years ago , you saw this creature .
it 's almost like leaving congress .
i mean , you 're born with no teeth .
you give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy .
but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth , they do n't regrow , unless , if you 're a lawyer .
so , a spanish woman who was dying of t.b . had a donor trachea , they took all the cells off the trachea , they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage .
this is kind of getting boring , right ?
third trend : robots .
( laughter ) we also thought we 'd have this robot to warn us of danger .
i mean , your grandparents had these great big cones , and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner , and now we have these little buds that nobody sees .
and now you have cochlear implants that go into people 's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear .
and then they 'll be able to see shape .
the universe was created 13.7 billion years ago , and then you created all the stars , and all the planets , and all the galaxies , and all the milky ways .
i think most of us are going to glance at it , and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it .
thank you very much .
and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is .
that is , we do n't just get a few more questions right on i.q . tests .
if you score us against their norms , we would have an average i.q . of 130 .
and then they found , in 1898 , that they 'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute .
and then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
and , in other words , it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible , not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand .
a crow can peck at a fish .
`` are there camels in hamburg ? '' '' and the fellow said , `` well , if it 's large enough , there ought to be camels there . '' ''
you ca n't do science without proposing hypotheses .
in 1910 , they looked at the examinations that the state of ohio gave to 14-year-olds , and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information .
when they looked at the exams that the state of ohio gave in 1990 , they were all about abstractions .
so the tenor of education has changed .
today , 35 percent of americans practice cognitively demanding professions , not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer , but many , many sub-professions having to do with being a technician , a computer programmer .
they went far beyond that 1900 banker .
they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aaa , though in many cases , they had virtually bribed the rating agencies .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously , and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections .
they said that is the dumbest thing you 've ever said .
if you have a principle such as , people should n't suffer unless they 're guilty of something , then to exclude black people you 've got to make exceptions , do n't you ?
you have to say , well , blackness of skin , you could n't suffer just for that .
what are dogs like ?
they would say wolves .
`` lord curzon once said he saw people bathing in the north sea , and he said , `` '' why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? '' '' as if they were a reptile . ''
`` well , dickens was right and he was wrong . [ correction : rudyard kipling ] [ kipling ] said , `` '' the colonel 's lady and judy o'grady are sisters underneath the skin . '' '' ( applause ) ''
i can switch to different data views .
so , multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in hci .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .
and probably for most people in this room , that 's how you think about it .
and the first thing that i want to talk about , the first thing i think we need to understand is : how do people respond to the epidemic ?
people are learning more things about it .
but life expectancy in africa , even without aids , is really , really low : 40 or 50 years in a lot of places .
areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some — it does n't decrease as much . and areas with high levels of malaria — actually , it 's increasing a little bit , although that 's not significant .
we know they had this campaign . that 's how we learn about what works .
botswana is a place with a lot of aids , egypt is a place without a lot of aids .
you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as unaids says , we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group .
and we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there .
coffee is uganda 's major export .
so you can see that both of these series — the black line is export value , the red line is new hiv infections — you can see they 're both increasing .
and the thing that 's most exciting about that is every time i think about research , there are more questions .
and what 's really , really great about being here is i 'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that i think up myself .
and in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since 1790 .
because they had banker hours basically .
and if we do n't have fire , we actually could not live .
in fact , our humanity , and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we 've invented .
i call this entire thing — us humans as our technology , everything that we 've made , gadgets in our lives — we call that the technium . that 's this world .
but it 's also law . and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us .
it goes back . the origins and roots of technology go back to the big bang , in this way , in that they are part of this self-organizing thread that starts at the big bang and goes through galaxies and stars , into life , into us .
`` what i would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going , we continue that trajectory , and we say `` '' well what 's going to become more energy-dense , that 's where it 's going . '' '' and so what i 've done is , i 've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say , `` what are the general trends in evolutionary life ? '' ''
for instance , right now , three-quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself .
`` i use the word `` '' want . '' '' technology wants . ''
this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power .
you can take all kinds of curves , and they 're all pointing up .
he could buy things that king henry , in all his wealth , could never buy .
so , technology is selfish ; technology is generous .
and so , every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go , and our choice , so to speak , in technology , is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .
and in between , i can show you the romance of the city of light .
day to night is a global project , and my work has always been about history .
i am a relentless collector of magical moments .
i see time as a fabric as well , except i take that fabric and flatten it , compress it into single plane .
you can see michelle waiting with the children , the president now greets the crowd , he takes his oath , and now he 's speaking to the people .
you realize that times square is a canyon , it 's shadow and it 's sunlight .
time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around .
`` at a 10-year memorial for the genocide , he reflected , `` '' i believed at the time i was doing my best , but i realized after the genocide that there was more i could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support . '' '' the aids epidemic caught the health community unprepared , and today , when the world health organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease , i 'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier . ''
infection rates climbed , and when treatment became available in the west , treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus , it was unaffordable to the public sector across africa .
our pact with our patients , the hippocratic oath and its variants , is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship .
it was true just recently of ebola .
sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right , and it 's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together .
i 'm speaking up about a lot of things , even when it makes listeners uncomfortable , even when it makes me uncomfortable .
a recent new york times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country .
we do n't have to have all the answers to call for change .
i 'd like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
`` video : we are late to watch `` '' afghan star . '' '' we are going to watch `` '' afghan star . '' '' we are late . ''
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
i have to say , her husband backed her from the start .
`` now you 'd think that `` '' american idol '' '' would introduce a measure of americanization . ''
see , for instance , in this picture .
i was a media junkie , and eventually got involved with advertising .
and that 's how — with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in 1983 , and that 's very — the basic reason i 'm talking to you here today : because i got shot . ( laughter ) ( applause ) well , when i started working with my own work , i decided that i should n't do images .
and the half tombstone , for people who are not dead yet .
i wanted to take that into the realm of images , and i decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts .
and you become trapped into this kind of representation .
so this is a lighthouse .
departing from the lines , i decided to tackle the idea of points , like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves .
because i was doing this while i was making these pictures , i realized that i could add still another thing i was trying to make a subject — something that would interfere with the themes , so chocolate is very good , because it has — it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance .
i was n't interested in the very large things , or in the small things .
and i love this work , because i did these cartoonish clouds over manhattan for a period of two months .
the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
breast density refers to the relative amount of fat — pictured here in yellow — versus connective and epithelial tissues — pictured in pink .
two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue , which is why mammography does n't work as well in them .
well , you need to read the details of your mammography report .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that 's called fatty-replaced .
the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense .
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
digital mammography is still an x-ray of the breast , but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally , just like we can with a digital camera .
the u.s. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment , and what have we gained from that investment ?
and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they do n't realize are problems .
( laughter ) so if you will allow me a little creative license , i will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient 's problem with a physicist 's solution .
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape — ( laughter ) — michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out , and we attached the new detector , and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging , or mbi .
but using our new detector , we could begin to see the outline of a tumor .
you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that 's regulated by federal law , and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study .
( applause ) and the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
in this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors — one is small as three millimeters .
the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue , but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake , which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor .
in this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue , but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake , which we can also see on a color image .
mbi generates four images per breast .
mri generates over a thousand .
but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo .
the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram .
but i did n't start out obsessed with food .
it 's so simple , and we thought , you know , okay , it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year .
and we thought , god , this is such a good idea and it 's going to raise so much money .
all this time you 're — when you think about hunger , it 's a hard thing to think about , because what we think about is eating .
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally , but it 's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .
so african agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen .
and you know , the reality is that between farmers in america , who actually , quite frankly , when i spend time in the midwest , are pretty large in general .
but farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny , and that 's because they 're starving .
it 's crazy .
hello . you do n't put soda in bottles .
so there 's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system .
and so in my lifetime , a lot of what 's happened in the world — and being a person obsessed with food — a lot of this has really changed .
understanding how to produce protein in a way that 's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers .
and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way , where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips .
well , if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple , then maybe it 's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn , soy and wheat .
here 's where it happens .
it 's not considered vintage — she just likes certain music to sound a certain way .
`` he says , `` '' you look like a mermaid , but you walk like a waltz . '' '' and the girl goes , `` '' wha ' ? '' '' so , the guy replies , `` '' yeah , i know , i know . ''
i 'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow , but i 'll stay until you show up , ponytail or not .
and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve , we should have some evidence of their existence by now .
`` `` '' where is everybody ? '' '' asked fermi , and his colleagues had no answer . ''
fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies , sasquatch , god , the possibility of love — and thereafter , as you know , enrico fermi ate alone .
perhaps , i dare say , even on other planets .
think about it .
( laughter ) and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien , would n't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ?
i was pretty good at the video games . i was not very good at the other part , so i stayed alone with the cosmos .
it was as though time had stopped .
slits for mouths ?
maybe it was swamp gas , but — ( laughter ) — i know what i saw .
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal , who sat on my left .
and in 1989 , the way i remember it , i was in philadelphia visiting my girlfriend , and we decided , apropos of nothing , to go see this movie .
and the way i remember it , the movie featured these details .
i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact , as we walked hand in hand , and pondering these very same questions .
excuse me ? no , not in my life .
for what it 's worth , we went to sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world .
( laughter ) our last day in portugal , we were in the district capital of faro , and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time .
it was at that moment , in that very small town of 30,000 or so , that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it .
loved to fight , lost his arm in one of these battles .
that 's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from .
they 've become artificial hips .
and then they 've evolved further to become not just nice to have but essential to have .
so this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone .
now , the problem with eddies is , they tend to disappear .
we do n't know , if you change the gravity substantially , if the same thing will happen to create your body .
you 've got tummy tucks and you 've got this and you 've got that .
( applause )
i first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .
and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor .
and they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head .
so it immediately cools , and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it 's dissolved , and it precipitates out , forming black smoke .
and living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals : shrimp , fish , lobsters , crab , clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold .
it 's raining like crazy here .
i 'm a big fan of grassroots organizations .
`` i 've been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , `` '' but , but what can i do ? ''
look in your own backyard .
create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same .
and maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
and do that , and spread the word .
the vent community animals ca n't really do much about the life and death that 's going on where they live , but up here we can .
in theory , we 're thinking , rational human beings .
now , i do n't get a wish , but i certainly can say that i will do anything i can to support sylvia earle 's wish .
chances are , if you 're living on less than four dollars a day , and you 're an amputee , you 've lost your limb in a vehicle accident .
there 's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee .
it 's a polycentric knee , and all that that means is the mechanism , is a four-bar mechanism , that mimics a natural human knee .
but at 1,400 dollars , it 's still too expensive for people like kamal .
( applause ) but the key is , you can have this great invention , you can have this great design , but how do you get it to the people who most need it ?
and the first thing is that the product needs to be world class .
and he 's doing a 10-meter walk test .
he 's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee , and he 's doing that same 10-meter walk test .
what is the local market like ?
we 'd seen that users had actually modified it .
we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways .
but here we have the version three , the remotion knee , but if you look in here , you can see the noise dampener . it 's quieter .
and this goes into my last point .
pournima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg , and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee , and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers , she 's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman , because she was in school , she had just started school to study engineering .
when i was a student , the mortality rate was about 95 percent .
that means one about every 15 minutes .
now , when we talk about suicide , there is also a medical contribution here , because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness : depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , anorexia , borderline personality . there 's a long list of disorders that contribute , and as i mentioned before , often early in life .
but you can see actually they are further down this list , and that 's because we 're talking here about disability .
what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression ?
well , there are probably three reasons .
but what really drives these numbers , this high morbidity , and to some extent the high mortality , is the fact that these start very early in life .
fair enough . they are disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds .
( laughter ) at the same time , i probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw .
and yet , they do it in a very different way .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
it 's a liquid that is completely black .
so what happened now is , when the watercolor was flowing into the structure , the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid .
that means it does n't mix with the water .
and at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
and now i 'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey .
add some more .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey , and that i should rather drink it .
( applause ) thank you .
so , i have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?
we have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods , and for me the abaya , my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today .
her answer was quite the contrary .
and yes , qatar wants to be a modern nation .
and we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance .
so i want to ask a question : what should culture in the 21st century look like ?
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women .
you know , art and culture is big business .
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories , share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices .
they 're learning our culture , our language , our heritage and realizing we 're just as different and just the same as each other .
this is a very interesting journey .
familiarity destroys and trumps fear . try it .
( applause )
how about this word ?
here , i 'll show it to you .
lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
just to let you know , i do not have a lexicographical whistle .
i want to throw my big net into the deep , blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom .
but secondly , i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed .
our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign .
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f-word , which has happened in american dictionaries since 1965 .
this is the oxford english dictionary online , one of the best online dictionaries .
there 's not a lot of clickiness .
how can this be ? i mean , i love books . i really love books .
you know , there 're still going to be paper dictionaries , but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary .
so if we 're not worrying about directing traffic , if we 've transcended paper , if we are worrying less about control and more about description , then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile .
you can ask for help !
library of congress : 17 million books , of which half are in english .
if only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it , that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
he 's found more than 140 comets .
but he found 140 comets without a telescope .
does n't everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language — we can make it be the whole language .
this is what dictionaries used to look like .
thank you very much for your kind attention .
and so i 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today .
i 'm going to talk about a program i started there , which , from my point of view , is the proudest thing i did .
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
now , i had two preconditions .
well , for one thing , we 're a youth-obsessed culture .
but the second part of it — and the older i get , the more convinced i am that that 's true .
so , i thought okay , now , what is it going to take to make this work ?
there are the journalist interviews , which are the interrogation that is expected .
then there 's the celebrity interview , where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers .
that 's frost-nixon , where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process .
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the brush in their self-portrait .
this was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
these were people through their 90s .
and so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
it 's pre-programmed . it 's infomercial , and we all have infomercials about our lives .
she was editor of vanity fair , one of the great phenomenal women of her day .
and i began to wonder what was going on , and you think while you talk , and basically , i thought , i got it .
now i 'm her competitor for the audience .
it was n't this arm-wrestle , but it was a little surprising for the person involved .
and i asked him one question .
first of all , was that dance , even though it had n't been offered to her , was her life .
good evening .
it 's still not doing that .
the door that i thought was open was actually just slightly ajar — this door of america that would open wide if you had the right name , the right skin color , the right networks , but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion , the wrong immigration status , the wrong skin color .
so i started a career as a social entrepreneur , starting an organization for young people like myself — i was young at the time that i started it — who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent .
i volunteered on election day to do exit polling .
and once the application was submitted , there were fingerprints to be taken , a test to study for , endless hours of waiting in line .
we also adopted by ballot referendum the office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york .
i was a young immigrant woman from belize .
no job felt more perfect for me .
because a raid at your workplace , a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever .
and it 's these three things — immigrants ' votes , voices and vantage points — that i think can help make our democracy stronger .
fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by asian-americans or latinos , the two largest immigrant groups in our country .
that dedication , that commitment to america we also bring to public service .
you 're scared that i 'm going to take away your place at the table , and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table .
so my optimism never wavers , because i know that there are millions of immigrants just like me , in front of me , behind me and all around me .
so you may ask — ( applause ) you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
this is me at cern in geneva , switzerland , which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world .
the woman i thought i was would have said yes .
but deep down , i knew that the right decision was to go home , even if i did n't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
that was a decision based on love and responsibility .
i am still completely committed to the cause of male-female equality , but let 's think about what that equality really means , and how best to achieve it .
i always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers , so that the measure of male-female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions : prime ministers , presidents , ceos , directors , managers , nobel laureates , leaders .
they routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies , but at the same time , they rank very high on the oecd better life index .
the feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
and i still hope that i live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force .
but i 've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work , and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do .
thirty years ago , carol gilligan , a wonderful psychologist , studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care , an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice .
`` it turns out that `` '' you do n't care '' '' is just as much a part of who we are as `` '' that 's not fair . '' '' bill gates agrees . ''
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
and you know , how on earth did i get to 17 and not know that ?
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
and then i was a masseuse . and then i was a landscape gardener .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .
but all that belief had fueled me so long .
i always end up in the gents ' toilets .
`` and then he said to me , `` '' what did you want to be when you were little ? '' '' now listen , i was n't going to say to him , `` '' well , i wanted to race cars and motorbikes . '' '' hardly appropriate at this moment in time . ''
but i did know the game was up .
and there was a rock that i always missed .
`` what am i going to be ? '' '' and i thought about my dad , and i thought , `` '' good god , i 'm so not sue now . '' '' and i kept thinking over and over in my mind , what had happened ? where did it go wrong ? why did n't i understand ? ''
and you know , the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers .
i had lost my belief .
`` do something different . what do you want to be ? '' '' and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened . ''
and it did happen this way .
from global management consultant to elephant handler .
i had no idea how . i had no idea how you hire an elephant , get an elephant .
i did n't speak hindi . i 'd never been to india . had n't a clue .
but i knew i would .
because , when you make a decision at the right time and the right place , god , that universe makes it happen for you .
i chucked in my job at accenture .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .
that 's what i wanted to do .
even though i present confident , i was scared .
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
( applause )
we started selectively breeding animals many , many thousands of years ago .
dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .
then there 's the liger .
be easier to find us at night .
and in fact , right now in many states , you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets .
nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country — much different in europe — without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
and now , using a joystick , they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right , forwards or backwards .
and in fact , this technology has gotten so developed that this creature — this is a moth — this is the moth in its pupa stage , and that 's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology , so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth , it is already prewired .
again , it 's got technology — it 's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres ; it 's got a camera on top of its head .
the scientists can make this creature go left , right .
they 've now created an organic robot .
this is miguel nicolelis of duke .
so now we have organic computer chips made out of living , self-aggregating neurons .
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
this is where we are in this process .
( laughter ) but in fact , that 's not what frankenstein 's lab looks like .
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future .
a hundred years ago this month , a 36-year-old albert einstein stood up in front of the prussian academy of sciences in berlin to present a radical new theory of space , time and gravity : the general theory of relativity .
now , if you followed the news at the time , you 'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed , and you 'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle .
and the higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field , except it has a constant value everywhere .
and this value is crucial .
if it were a tiny bit different , then there would be no physical structure in the universe .
so this is the first of our dangerous numbers , the strength of the higgs field .
`` they have sexy-sounding names like `` '' supersymmetry '' '' or `` '' large extra dimensions . '' '' i 'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now , but the key point is this : if any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the higgs field , then we should see new particles being created at the lhc along with the higgs boson . ''
one of the most important consequences of einstein 's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time 13.8 billion years ago , the big bang .
`` if we follow this line of thinking , then we will never be able to answer the question , `` why is there something rather than nothing ? '' ''
we ca n't access these other universes , so there 's no way of knowing whether they 're there or not .
now , the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while , but in the last few years , we 've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out .
i just mentioned , introducing you , that we live in a short-term world .
bg : harry , thank you . hc : thank you very much .
`` i said , `` '' but what was all the 'three weeks until , ' 'two weeks until ' emails ? ''
let 's do something anyway !
`` he said , `` '' mr. veitch , i 'm not responsible for anything you have ordered . '' '' i said , `` '' let 's not get into who did what . ''
and as legacies go , i do n't think that 's bad .
if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes , you might dismiss them as poor and simple .
it will take elders ' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance .
he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world .
there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island .
they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars , the sequence and direction of waves , the flight patterns of certain birds .
in fact , the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel .
`` sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud-covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island , and he would look out , and then he would say , `` okay , we go . '' ''
we live in a society bloated with data , yet starved for wisdom .
it always was .
and that changed my mindset forever .
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset .
and i do n't mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. — that 's a piece of cake , with one billion people .
but i will start with a historical background .
i will start at 1858 .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india was defeated by the british forces .
i have transformed the laser beam into an ecological , recyclable version here , in green india .
india was not always like this level .
can you see how it starts to move there ?
but careful now — we are approaching the first world war .
united kingdom is going down .
and the market reformer was successful there .
and if i would also look at india , you have another type of inequity , actually , in india .
and here , maharashtra , with mumbai , is forging forward .
if you have a lot inequity , macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living .
my friends at gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in washington who is really concerned about the health system .
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
that 's the dot com bubble . this is the lehman brothers doorstep there .
i can compare to japan . this is japan coming up .
and there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place .
get your bookings in time . thank you very much .
i teach chemistry .
so more than just explosions , chemistry is everywhere .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
but what fascinated me more is that maddie 's curiosity took her to a new level .
but i found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied .
where did this guy get this confidence , the audacity of it ?
now i absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom , and before i went back into the classroom that fall , i wrote down three rules of my own that i bring to my lesson planning still today .
now riley 's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here .
`` she 's going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask , `` '' why ? '' '' yeah . why . ''
we all were at that age .
but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry , we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day , and spark their imagination .
the two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the internet and the mobile phone .
you could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting .
how big ? well , i can give you the numbers — 140,000 square meters — but that does n't really tell you very much .
you think about the largest ikea store you 've ever been in .
this is five times larger .
how many hard drives can you fit in an ikea store ?
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
our worst fears might have been something like this , but we did n't know this was happening .
we did n't know about this . we did n't know about prism .
we did not know about skywriter — all these different programs run by u.s. intelligence agencies .
so what do we actually know about the leaks ?
so for example , they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for yahoo on the march 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
der spiegel , from germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
but people are scared about terrorists , and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide .
and i have nothing to hide .
privacy is nonnegotiable .
it should be built in to all the systems we use .
we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon .
and to quote a fellow security researcher , marcus ranum , he said that the united states is right now treating the internet as it would be treating one of its colonies .
by building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country does n't have to solve the problem by itself .
and for a few years , we were the only nuclear power on earth .
it was absolutely incredible .
yet , what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house ?
here is their first big public announcement .
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .
what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon ?
seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year .
this is alexander lebed , who was a general that worked with yeltsin , who talked about , and presented to congress , this idea that the russians had developed — these suitcase bombs . they were very low yield — 0.1 to one kiloton , hiroshima was around 13 kilotons — but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage .
it was 9.8 feet long , weighed 8,800 pounds . you go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so , you rent a truck that 's got the right capacity , and you take your bomb , you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go .
now , in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible , or you have to be on a floor — on a high floor — if it 's a ground burst explosion , which it would be , higher than the ninth floor . so you have to be tenth floor or higher , or in the basement .
and if you do that , you actually can survive a nuclear blast .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
but let 's assume , theoretically , you want to do that .
if you 're very close to what happened , you actually do have to duck and cover , like bert told you , bert the turtle .
`` do n't give any more information . '' '' ( laughter ) so i said , `` '' yes . '' '' and she said , `` '' and where do , um , where do human women , like , where do women lay their eggs ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , funny you should ask . ( laughter ) we have evolved to have our own pond . ''
it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ...
despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left juliano in a wheelchair , juliano rose to the occasion , and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed impossible .
so as we saw this happening , we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago .
we reenacted this paper .
and that 's exactly why juliano could kick that ball just by thinking , because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic , quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback .
because a couple years after brazil was awarded the world cup , we heard that the brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the germans , of course .
that 's why the brain is creating a new sensation in bruno 's head .
`` so he walks , and at the end of the walk — i am running out of time already — he says , `` '' you know , guys , i need to borrow this thing from you when i get married , because i wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself . ''
and in basically 13 seconds , juliano actually did .
he gets ready , the ball is set , and he kicks .
and that 's priceless .
i have two minutes to tell you that it 's going to the limits of your imagination .
and the same time , he is sending a mental message to the second rat that did n't see any light , and the second rat , in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina .
the black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel , in real time .
so what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down , the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back , so this adjusts dynamically , but the global synchrony remains the same .
the second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex , or a different pulse , two different pulses .
and he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the internet across continents .
that 's the next ted talk at the next conference .
would you describe that as global citizenship ?
but what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism .
it was before the avian flu had reached europe .
but then at some point , one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution .
point is : there 's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .
you have them in hunter-gatherer societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games , involving more people over larger territory .
now , back to the unfolding apocalypse .
what i have in mind is : terrorism happens here ; we overreact to it .
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regulation of dangerous technologies .
i 've got to admit i feel silly saying that .
i 'm just doing what i can here .
i think it 's the first step toward that . that 's the long-term goal .
aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space , architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses .
from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff .
and i 've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that 's used in the service of creating a particular special effect .
now , here we go , one side , the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was .
it 's formless , featureless , depthless , scaleless , massless , purposeless and dimensionless .
but these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time .
in any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
so , the nature of the building is that it looks at looking — i mean that 's its primary objective , both its program and its architectural conceit .
we 're taking over now , doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions .
so it 's a very , very thin architecture .
you can kind of peer into other people 's lives .
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
should have done this before i tried to pitch it .
( laughter ) on the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
so , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
they do n't have to struggle for it like jacob wrestling through the night with the angel , or like jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness , or like muhammad , not only that night on the mountain , but throughout his years as a prophet , with the koran constantly urging him not to despair , and condemning those who most loudly proclaim that they know everything there is to know and that they and they alone are right .
it 's fanaticism , and we have to stop confusing the two .
we have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers .
i can hardly say i believe it .
i can only have faith in it , commit myself , that is , to the idea of it , and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
i was looking at my phone . i thought , i could just delete this .
then i started to panic .
bank : cream egg .
( laughter ) i 'm not joking , this is what turned up in my inbox .
and if you 're going to do this — and i highly recommend you do — get yourself a pseudonymous email address .
( applause )
i came to jail when i was so young .
i must be strong , have to hold on .
dream of freedom , hope for mercy .
i 've been incarcerated for 27 years .
i 've been incarcerated for 27 years .
this is not my home .
( applause ) joann butler : 005961 .
i 've been incarcerated for 37 years .
when i was about three or four years old , i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers , and i remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book , to feel the picture they were discussing .
for example , when i studied at graduate school at queen 's university in canada , the prisoners at the collins bay jail agreed to help me .
and now i can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries .
( laughter ) you see , if i read like that , i 'd fall asleep .
i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
( jaws speaking ) ( laughter ) rm : you know , when you 're marking student essays , you want to get through them fairly quickly .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
for example , in spain , there are a 100,000 accessible books in spanish .
well , because we ca n't transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different english-speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter .
i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being .
but contained inside those documents was a new language , a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science — namely symmetry .
what crystals are possible , we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry .
in microbiology you really do n't want to get a symmetrical object , because they are generally rather nasty .
and a beautiful example of this i found , actually , when i visited a colleague of mine in japan , professor kurokawa .
the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .
what is symmetry ? when [ there ] are two of these walls , do they have the same symmetries ?
for galois , symmetry — unlike for thomas mann , which was something still and deathly — for galois , symmetry was all about motion .
and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another , to change geometry into language .
i can reflect it in the line through x , or the line through y , or the line through z .
okay ? so i want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many symmetries there are .
what galois realized : it is n't just the individual symmetries , but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object .
b , for example , rotates the little yellow dot to the b on the starfish . and so on .
let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle , one after the other .
well , the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with .
it 's as if it was reflected in the line through y .
and they 'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle , or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish .
i think this is an amazing development .
but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet .
but these are things that we can see .
rather than you all shouting out , i want you to count how many digits there are in that number . okay ?
20 digits or less , sit down .
how many digits are there in your number ?
18. so it goes to this lady here .
and i think what drives me , as a mathematician , are those things which are not seen , the things that we have n't discovered .
it 's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject .
if you think about the phone — and intel has tested a lot of the things i 'm going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 elderly households — 300 in ireland , and 300 in portland — trying to understand : how do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way ?
`` `` hello ? uh , hey . '' ''
`` `` '' hello ? uh , who ? ''
has their voice gotten more quiet ? we 're doing a lot of work with people with alzheimer 's and particularly with parkinson 's , where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with parkinson 's patients may be the best early indicator of parkinson 's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically .
is it a dexterity problem ? is it the onset of arthritis ?
behavioral markers matter .
we have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
i mean we sort of get it here , but we do n't get it here , and we 're not doing anything about it .
the health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that 's coming , and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care , but deliver care in some radically different ways .
and in fact , it 's upon us .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a social security administrator .
and it 's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body , and divided care into departments and compartments .
we are wired , in our imagination , to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place .
`` our entire health reform discussion right now , health i.t. , when we talk with policy makers , equals `` '' how are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? '' '' we 're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home . ''
and the problem is we ca n't afford it today , folks .
and how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that 's around us to change our behavior ?
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
many people in this generation wo n't press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they do n't want to bother anybody , even though they 've been paying 30 dollars a month .
i ca n't stop this from happening .
i 've been wearing a little technology that we call shimmer .
i 'm a qualitative researcher , but when i look at these data streams coming in from these homes , i can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the household . right ?
but when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time — and we 're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length — these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we 've never understood before .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it 's the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
so , my mantra here , my fourth slogan is : 10,000 households or bust .
`` the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , `` '' our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years . '' '' it 's achievable . we should do it economically , we should do it morally , and we should do it for quality of life . ''
these are trees that would stand out in midtown manhattan .
nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings , and , in any case , the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow .
in recent historic times , about 96 percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down , especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging , clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s .
it 's a kind loaner from ted .
and yet , when you look at the base of a redwood tree , you 're not seeing the organism .
but they made it to the top , and what they found was not a redwood desert , but a lost world — a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air , filled with unknown life .
my wife and i adore our children .
children are incredibly adept at climbing trees .
this is my daughter laura , then 15 , looking out of a tree boat .
these are huckleberry bushes .
maria 's sitting on one of them .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
this three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a redwood named iluvatar , made by steve sillett , marie antoine and their colleagues , gives you an idea .
i 've wanted to ask craig venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to .
these are millennial structures — portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
the scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees .
and we 're moving in a full circle now .
and what we 're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species — that is to say , its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite — but we 're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth .
richard preston : yes , that is correct . i mentioned hyperion , the world 's tallest tree .
the drugs navigate throughout all of your body .
that means that once in the body , they start dissolving , delivering the drug only locally , slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole-body treatment .
my personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14 .
so i needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving .
and that is how programming started for me .
little girls are amazing .
and they do n't know that they are not supposed to like computers .
it 's the parents who do .
`` `` '' it 's magic , '' '' some of us say . ''
her name is ruby , she is six years old .
she is completely fearless , imaginative and a little bit bossy .
ruby taught me that you 're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed .
and idealistic foxes , and so on .
in ruby 's world , you learn technology through play .
`` i know what a computer is : it 's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time . '' '' but then we would talk and we would discover that actually , a car is a computer , it has a navigation system inside of it . ''
and a dog — a dog might not be a computer , but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it .
and grocery stores , they have so many different kinds of computers , like the cashier system and the burglar alarms .
imagine a world where the little ada lovelaces of tomorrow , who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s , they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology .
thank you .
( applause )
the language i 'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world 's universal language , for better or for worse .
so for example , in french and spanish the word for table is , for some reason , marked as feminine .
`` so , `` '' la table , '' '' `` '' la mesa , '' '' you just have to deal with it . ''
it 's a highly fraught concept .
it 's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world .
one of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture , if you want to drink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language channels the culture — and that seems doubtful — if you want to imbibe the culture , you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in .
there 's one scene closest to the end , where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital .
to go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture .
they stay still , and the vowels dance around the consonants .
imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time .
other than that you had books that did n't work , that 's just the way it was .
( applause )
his commitment to his education was unwavering , and he never lost hope .
how would you do it ?
it was the world 's first popular computer .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
if you were an educated child , you would know how to not only use the astrolabe , you would also know how to make an astrolabe .
and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe , the first technical manual in the english language , was written by geoffrey chaucer .
the idea is actually relatively simple .
each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole , onto a flat surface , where it is then recorded .
now , the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection .
the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly .
and you can see the different components .
this is the mater , the scales on the back .
and this one , this is a replica from a 15th-century device .
so , tonight , if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle .
so , it 's about 26 degrees . you ca n't see it from over there .
he would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
so , affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it .
it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types .
this is one from oxford .
so , would little lewis have an astrolabe ?
and so here 's the challenge : i want you to help me create a fully 3d , dynamic , parameterized contact model .
now if we want to design a foot , what do we have to do ?
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
how do they do it ?
take a look at what that is !
( applause ) and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .
really simple , but beautiful .
when you touched the cockroach leg — can you get the microphone for him ?
did you notice something ?
so to our blueprint , we need to add tuned spines .
it could n't do that before ; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over .
it looks , in fact , like it 's swimming up the surface .
did you touch it ?
this is when its foot 's in the air .
so it 's pretty tough to do .
this is what it looks like close up — here 's the ant foot , and there 's the glue .
and we discovered this glue may be an interesting two-phase mixture .
it certainly helps it to hold on .
if you look at their feet , they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs .
we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone .
and that 's exactly what he 's done .
he 's built , in fact , a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature .
so these are tuned toes — there are six of them , and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint .
it 's a very challenging task . but more to come later .
thank you .
they had n't evolved yet .
most pages are destroyed soon after being written .
and you have to get yourself in a desert .
here 's a picture that i took in southern patagonia .
in the austral summer of 2004 , i went to the bottom of south america , to the bottom of patagonia , argentina , to prospect for dinosaurs : a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age , in a desert , a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists .
that bone is 2.2 meters across .
now , one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species , you get to name it .
( laughter ) they 're not .
and these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance , giving them immense stability , because when you 're 65 tons , when you 're literally as big as a house , the penalty for falling over is death .
and then came the long ...
and then , in east africa , an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought .
but the earth is very , very old .
but we only get one history , and it 's the one that we have .
it could 've just been another day — a thursday , perhaps — among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs .
now go down to the mouth of the missouri , near st. louis , and it 's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal .
everything that we choose to put on is a narrative , a story about where we 've been , what we 're doing , who we want to be .
i made a lot of my own toys .
it began with ice cream .
there was a baskin-robbins in my hometown , and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant , five-gallon , cardboard tubs .
`` ... and this is the `` '' jaws '' '' costume my mom bought for me . ''
they helped — ( laughter ) it was the armor .
`` ( laughter ) i was like , `` '' are they reading my mind ? ''
we carefully , over that month , constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves .
now , this is the one thing in this talk that i do n't have a slide to show you , because no photo exists of this armor .
in third period math , i was standing in the back of class , and i 'm standing in the back of class because the armor did not allow me to sit down .
`` and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says , `` '' are you feeling ok ? '' '' i 'm thinking , `` '' are you kidding ? am i feeling ok ? ''
( laughter ) but the producer in my mind reminds myself that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo , that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me . ( laughter )
`` five years into the `` '' mythbusters '' '' run , we got invited to appear at san diego comic-con . ''
`` it 's not called costuming at cons , it 's called `` '' cosplay . '' '' now ostensibly , cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime , but it is so much more than that . ''
understand , i ca n't see anything inside this costume .
i can hear what they 're saying and i can see their feet .
now , i did n't start this fire , but i did pour petrol on it .
my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience .
( laughter ) now , i had friends in the u.s .
first , the axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states , and it was getting great hits on youtube .
we filmed that process and aired a documentary .
these comics are now going to the new york festival .
and the lebanese , brilliant lebanese , nemr abou nassar , we featured in our first tour , has just been performing in l.a. 's legendary comedy clubs .
( laughter ) here are three questions that i like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story .
let 's change the narrative together and let 's start righting writing wrongs .
and then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
the most beautiful landscapes i had seen in asia were sri lanka and bali .
as a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message ( laughter ) on the back of the shirt . ( laughter )
just before i left new york i decided i could actually renovate my studio .
it includes 330 compasses .
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .
and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
that 's about five percent of everybody .
i 've found that finding out about what i 'm going to like in the future , my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it .
( laughter ) in the beginning , on the first sabbatical , it was rather disastrous .
what came out of it ?
and i 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica , the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto , in portugal .
we put a mask on it , looked at it deep down in the ground , checked it out from all sides , west , north , south , east , top and bottom .
which , when you actually have to design a beethoven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .
it works the same internally with the president or the musical director , whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards .
the truck they go on tour with .
like this donna toney poster , or chopin , or mozart , or la monte young .
this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york .
we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .
`` and with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week , created this fairly floral typography that spelled , `` '' obsessions make my life worse and my work better . '' '' and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between , `` '' should i really take as much money as i can ? ''
and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .
they were n't quite slick enough .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
they did a fine job , but had a couple of readability problems .
and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .
twenty-five years ago , scientists at cern created the world wide web .
since then , the internet has transformed the way we communicate , the way we do business , and even the way we live .
we 've lost privacy , yes , but actually what we 've also lost is the idea of privacy itself .
let 's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today : email .
well , if we really think about it , we see that the business model of the internet today really is n't compatible with privacy .
just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web , and you see that advertising plays a huge role .
here 's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages .
so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do , for the people out there who ca n't understand how to use it , the option to communicate privately simply does not exist .
i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community .
earlier this year , protonmail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources , and when this happened , our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars .
the good news i can share with you guys today , the exciting news , is that we 're not traveling alone .
they did n't think it was significant , but there was an outrage in the community .
number two , a poet .
but his questions spoke as clearly as my four-year-old 's hug .
now if you know aaron swartz , you know that we lost him just over a year ago .
it was about six weeks before i gave my ted talk , and i was so grateful to chris that he asked me to give this ted talk , not because i had the chance to talk to you , although that was great , but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression .
it saved me .
eighteen months later , at the age of 90 , she arrived in washington with hundreds following her , including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her .
hope .
and we 're going to fight for , however impossible this battle looks .
you still with me ? ( laughter ) i called her up .
`` `` hey , ma , i got to talk to you . '' ''
`` and i told her i was coming to ted , and she said , `` what 's the problem ? '' ''
camaguey is a province in cuba .
my father is at once quick-witted , wickedly funny , and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless .
and then there are stories that we whisper into a stygian darkness .
it makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth — is that enough ? it makes your armpits juicy , you know ?
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' is that thing real ? '' '' `` i think so . '' ''
`` `` oh , jesus . '' ''
`` `` how are you doing it ? '' ''
only a couple of women are going uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . right .
`` i said , `` '' ma , pick a lane ! '' '' `` they give you seven lanes , they expect you to use them . '' ''
`` `` i did not get a ticket . '' ''
( laughter ) you should be terrified .
talk to me . yes . yes . you can say yes .
do i want to walk in , because unless i have ariadne 's thread to anchor — enough metaphors for you ? — somewhere , i may not get out .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' why do we have to take pop 's underwear back now ? ''
`` by now , we have now crawled another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , `` '' i knew it , i knew it . ''
correct the other direction now , it 's ok .
`` `` '' i know that , honey . get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till i get there . '' '' ok , i want a vote . come on , come on . no , no . ''
( laughter ) and years of therapy later , we 're doing great .
before i know it , she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars , and people behind me , with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us , wah-wah wah-wah .
`` she says , `` '' ma , you got to look ! '' '' now , when this kid says i got to look , you know . ''
i do n't know what part of the country you live in .
she is , after all , cuban .
`` `` '' que ? '' '' which means `` '' what , '' '' and so much more . ''
intrepid soul .
( laughter ) i turn around , but it 's not a child . it 's a young woman , a little taller than i , pale green , amused eyes .
he turns to her on the heel of his shoe .
as i sat in my cold cell , i felt helpless , unloved and abandoned .
i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter that had my son 's squiggly handwriting on it .
`` i sat back on my bunk and i reflected on something i had read in [ plato ] , where socrates stated in `` '' apology '' '' that the unexamined life is n't worth living . ''
but it did n't come easy .
one of the things i realized , which was part of the transformation , was that there were four key things .
it was the first time in my life that i ever felt open to forgiving myself .
so imagine what it was like when i first grabbed my little blackberry and i started learning how to text .
i have a fellowship at mit media lab , i work for an amazing company called bme , i teach at the university of michigan , but it 's been a struggle because i realize that there are more men and women coming home who are not going to be afforded those opportunities .
i had to acknowledge that i had hurt others .
even though i had no expectations of them accepting it , it was important to do because it was the right thing .
engineering at the molecular level , working at the smallest of scales , can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer .
cancer is a very clever disease .
it 's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug .
the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the sirna from degrading in the bloodstream .
but our bodies have a natural immune-defense system : cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that do n't belong , so that it can destroy or eliminate them .
( applause ) the sirna is deployed first .
so , we first treated our animals with a dox core , dox only .
as doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types , they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use .
as a researcher , i usually do n't get to work with patients .
at this event , we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer .
this really touched me .
it 's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules .
it also happens in , for example , cancer research .
fifty patients got lorcainide , and of those patients , 10 died .
so they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published .
i felt misled .
now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature .
if i conducted one study and i withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud .
we need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans , including the older trials , because the fda amendment act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008 , and i do n't know what world it is in which we 're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years .
but i had to go upstairs , this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony , so it was incredibly hot , small and light , and i had to lie there . it was ridiculous .
it is endless .
okay , open your eyes .
that 's the space that i think sculpture — which is a bit of a paradox , sculpture that is about making material propositions — but i think that 's the space that sculpture can connect us with .
you 're asleep . you wake up , and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag , you can see for 70 miles .
i wanted to do something that was working directly with the world , directly with place .
( laughter ) but the fact is , this is evidence of a living body on other bodies , rocks that have been the subject of geological formation , erosion , the action of time on objects .
the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together , the darkness of the body .
this is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time .
can we map that space , using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays , taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit , but in complete reversal of , in a way , the most traditional greek idea of pointing ?
or can we do it as an exclusive membrane ?
human time , industrial time , tested against the time of the tides , in which these memories of a particular body , that could be any body , multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction , many times , placed over three square miles , a mile out to sea , disappearing , in different conditions of day and night .
this is just simply asking , again , as if we had arrived for the first time , what is the relationship of the human project to time and space ?
when they appear close to the edge , they are representations , representations in which the viewers have become the viewed .
for me , art is not about objects of high monetary exchange .
`` if art has any purpose , it is to open our eyes to that fact . '' '' thank you very much . ''
i was exhausted and my life was going nowhere .
i 've reconsidered the ideas i once had about prostitution .
potential employers wo n't hire you .
assuming you still need money , you 'll stay in the more flexible , informal economy .
imagine knowing if you 're busted carrying condoms , it 'll be used against you .
making that illegal means that many of us work alone , which obviously makes us vulnerable to violent offenders .
let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge , east london .
it creates a two-tiered system : legal and illegal work .
i do n't think this is an accident .
folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down .
this is a lesson of history .
it 's a fact that most buyers of sex are men with money , and most sellers are women without .
and i can understand why the sex industry provokes strong feelings .
but we ca n't make policy on the basis of mere feelings , especially not over the heads of the people actually effected by those policies .
it 's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing .
and we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and self-determination .
the universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella .
we 've had complicated experiences and complicated responses to those experiences .
she connected with our local organ-procurement organization , the washington regional transplant community .
this helped me see thomas in a new light .
`` i wrote a letter that started out , `` dear researcher . '' ''
two days later , i got a response from dr. arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania .
so to be able to participate in your study gives thomas 's life a new layer of meaning .
it 's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be .
i know i did n't . i think i 'm a normal person .
and since , in the last 20 years , i 've developed a studio in london .
sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her bead shop in london .
i 'm just going to show , for people who do n't know my studio 's work , a few projects that we 've worked on .
and just very quickly , something we 've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again .
but the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform .
i think we all kind of stand and watch .
we actually had to halve its speed , because everyone was too scared when we first did it .
and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this .
so people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that height that we have to have for its function .
and the world 's first public park of modern times was in britain .
and the world 's first major botanical institution is in london , and they have this extraordinary project where they 've been collecting 25 percent of all the world 's plant species .
and inside , the daylight — each one is an optic and it brings light into the center .
and to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
and the government agreed to do that and not do anything else , and focus our energy on that .
and so the rest of the site was a public space .
and then , you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur — in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we 've shaved it .
the british government — any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
and so there was a moment when suddenly — actually , the next thing .
this is the head of u.k. trade and investment , who was our client , with the chinese children , using the landscape .
( applause ) so we 're building these buildings .
( noises ) tedx .
maybe you 've encountered the zero-to-three movement , which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones .
once the baby 's born , it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else 's .
`` this is how researchers discovered that , after women repeatedly read aloud a section of dr. seuss ' `` '' the cat in the hat '' '' while they were pregnant , their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb . ''
a study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies cry in the accent of their mother 's native language .
from the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it — its mother .
it 's also tastes and smells .
in the autumn of 1944 , the darkest days of world war ii , german troops blockaded western holland , turning away all shipments of food .
and then on may 5th , 1945 , the siege came to a sudden end when holland was liberated by the allies .
one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation .
when food is scarce , they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
the fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it .
and the basis of the fetus ' prediction is what its mother eats .
the meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story , a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation .
the world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born .
what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances .
learning is one of life 's most essential activities , and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions — institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and some sociologists actually feel that it 's a closure , it 's a cocooning , that we 're disengaging from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they 're doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
so , none of these cases are unique .
it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms in this country , things that identify you , team-building activities , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
and i wo n't provide some feel-good , ready-made solutions .
let 's start from democracy .
`` a sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun , puts it to my head , and says , `` tell me where your father is or i will kill you . '' ''
but time we did n't get .
greece , yes , triggered the euro crisis , and some people blame me for pulling the trigger .
i , overly optimistically , had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for greece , for europe , for the world , to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions .
those profligate , idle , ouzo-swilling , zorba-dancing greeks , they are the problem . punish them !
`` my european counterparts , some of them , at least , said , `` '' you ca n't do this . ''
let 's throw democracy at the problem .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating , debating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .
and those who shunned politics , well , they were idiots .
and participation took place in the agora , the agora having two meanings , both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation .
where our common identity is democracy , where our education is through participation , and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia .
let 's not be .
thank you .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
it 's rather the other way — more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction .
gp : thank you very much.bg : thank you . ( applause )
i learned it when i was four at my mother 's knee .
`` i heard the word `` '' carcinoma . '' '' yes , breast cancer . ''
as a dancer , i know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear .
`` i said , `` '' is this it ? is this the end of the road ? ''
`` is this the end of my dance ? '' '' and he , the positive soul that he is , said , `` '' no , this is just a hiatus , a hiatus during the treatment , and you 'll get back to doing what you do best . '' '' i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind — the images that these thoughts created — and the action that derived from it . ''
so i would drag myself into my dance studio — body , mind and spirit — every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped .
and slowly , i moved out of that miserable state of mind .
my story is the power of a metaphor .
my physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy .
we then make that a video game to give patients simple , motivating objectives to follow .
poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls , so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer .
cosmin milhau : so it 's a microsoft surface pro 3 for the demo , but you just need a computer and a kinect , which is 120 dollars .
they 're not very well-designed .
i am the daughter of a forger , not just any forger ...
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather .
anyway , he was a photographer and a street educator , and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly .
i heard him come in .
`` and in my head i would be thinking that `` '' doing '' '' a war meant being a soldier . ''
and then i became a mother and had a son , and finally decided it was time — that he absolutely had to talk to us .
the whole family came to settle in france in the '30s .
that 's my father .
he was broke all of the time .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
and if he did not tell them , it was of course to protect them .
then there was the vietnam war .
europe was not spared either .
and i want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done .
and a lot of people ca n't even afford them .
and when they do , they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live .
and it raises really interesting questions about , how will we plan cities ? how will finance development ?
and in a way it should be kind of obvious , right , that in the 21st century , maybe cities can be developed by citizens .
and that 's a good thing .
most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what 's called the social economy or the core economy , which is people doing it for themselves .
and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production , and these technologies are coming back with a solution : actually , maybe no one . all of us .
it uses wedge and peg connections .
they do n't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that , and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day .
one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable .
we 're aware that wikihouse is a very , very small answer , but it 's a small answer to a really , really big question , which is that globally , right now , the fastest-growing cities are not skyscraper cities .
and i think the technology 's on our side .
in fact , everyone at school knew the block where we lived , because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs .
i attended boarding school and college in new england , studied abroad in chile and returned to the bronx to be a middle school teacher .
and i could list more .
( applause ) i police myself all the time .
should i wear my hair up or in a fro ?
so while i could not control the instability of their homes , the uncertainty of their next meal , or the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep , i provided them with a loving classroom that made them feel proud of who they are , that made them know that they mattered .
photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera , but today i want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and i did n't take any of them .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
i do n't know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , i 'm not in many of the family photos .
i 'm always the one taking the picture .
what would these unseen forms look like ?
i propose we look to nature .
if we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
we can begin to sculpt the form .
white surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are — all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
so let 's bring this process to architecture .
columns are architectural archetypes .
we can begin to zoom into them .
and unlike traditional architecture , it 's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
usually , an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing .
for me , or for my purpose at this moment , there 's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other .
almost all of the details , almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved .
machines are getting faster , it 's getting less expensive , and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
so where does this leave us ?
i 'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead .
but recently , i 've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation .
we studied 16 men and women , located in seven countries across the globe , working in 12 different industries .
it can be incremental , or it can be breakthrough .
`` my first visit to pixar was in 2005 , when they were working on `` '' ratatouille , '' '' that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef . ''
in the 20 years hence , they 've produced 14 movies .
most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks , if you will , in the kitchen .
it 's about running a series of experiments , and not a series of pilots .
when they do n't work , someone or something is to blame .
as the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data , or the evidence , began to come in , it became pretty clear that the big table solution was the right one for the moment .
so they selected that one .
`` he admitted , `` '' if you had forced us to all be on one team , we might have focused on proving who was right , and winning , and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for google . '' '' why is it that pixar and google are able to innovate time and again ? ''
they know how to do collaborative problem solving , they know how to do discovery-driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making .
but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again , we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about .
leading innovation is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving .
the leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities .
what kind of world do people want to belong in at pixar ?
`` `` '' i 'm a role model , i 'm a human glue , i 'm a connector , i 'm an aggregator of viewpoints . ''
hire people who argue with you .
we studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers , 19 competitors , to collaborate and innovate .
so they began to work on that .
in vineet 's language , this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few , and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that was happening every day .
why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy , but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy ?
but now we marry , and we stop having sex with others .
now , there are three ways that i think infidelity hurts differently today .
and i am it : i 'm chosen , i 'm unique , i 'm indispensable , i 'm irreplaceable , i 'm the one .
so if we can divorce , why do we still have affairs ?
but millions of people ca n't all be pathological .
but what if passion has a finite shelf life ?
but they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior .
priya , she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after hurricane sandy .
first of all , the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity .
but for heather , or deceived partners , it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth , to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity .
and instead , switch to what i call the investigative questions , the ones that mine the meaning and the motives — what did this affair mean for you ?
every affair will redefine a relationship , and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be .
but affairs are here to stay , and they 're not going away .
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
`` and he came up home from a run one day and said , `` '' dad , my legs are tingling . '' '' and that was the onset of als . ''
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we 'd accomplished a couple things .
since that time , we 've had all kinds of acknowledgment .
the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remembering things that i 've done in the past .
they 're not even enjoying the show .
one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family , and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law , her intestine suddenly strangled one day , and we took her to the emergency room , and she was , she was in really bad shape .
we almost lost her a couple of times , and i was there with my brother every day .
it 's not — we tend to take our cameras out when we 're doing awesome things .
early on , i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but i realized that was n't the way to go .
the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it .
i read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because i 'm a word person .
i think i 've always been that way .
now , poetry is n't one thing that serves one purpose any more than music or computer programming serve one purpose .
the more techniques you know , the more things you can make , and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love .
that said , poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things .
`` it says poems can bring people together temporarily , which i think is true , and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes , cleanly and simply on the two and four , `` say '' and `` way , '' with anticipatory hints on the one and three , `` answer '' and `` quarters , '' as if the poem itself were coming together . ''
you ca n't be sure , and that 's okay .
all we can do we is listen to poems and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need , and if you 're wrong about some part of a poem , nothing bad will happen .
`` that brave man comes up from below and walks without meditation , that brave man . '' '' [ wallace stevens ] now , the sun in this poem , in wallace stevens ' poem , seems so grave because the person in the poem is so afraid . ''
this sun is not afraid to show his face .
`` stevens saves that sonically odd word `` '' meditation '' '' for the end . ''
that 's what john keats is doing in his most mysterious , perhaps , poem .
every star in our sky is a sun .
and there are just so many stars and so many planets out there , that surely , there must be life somewhere out there .
but actually , we just work on our computers like everyone else , and we get our data by email or downloading from a database .
tatooine from star wars .
she lives with her parents , her two brothers and her great-aunt .
i can give scholarships to all the girls , you know , if they work hard and stay in school .
she went to high school .
the village became a real standout .
girls get aborted before they 're even born when there are scarce resources .
this girl here , for instance , is in a feeding center in ethiopia .
from one to five , girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys , in all of india .
and you know , when you educate a boy , his family tends to have fewer kids , but only slightly .
it 's kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they do n't spend it very wisely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
`` do you think we 'll make it ? '' '' so bill gates , as he was staring out at the audience , he said , `` '' if you 're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country , there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10 . '' '' so here is bill of arabia . ''
the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s : there were about 80,000 slaves transported from africa to the new world .
today , you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars , which means she 's actually more disposable .
so finally , they put her at the edge of the village in a hut .
so now , mahabuba , she is saving the lives of hundreds , thousands , of women .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .
i 've talked about some of the challenges , let me talk about some of the solutions , and there are predictable solutions .
she lives in a small village outside lahore , pakistan .
look : u.s. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized u.s. aid .
`` there 's a book called `` '' dead aid . '' '' you know , the criticism is fair ; it is n't easy . ''
and she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they do n't go hungry in the winter .
and so the question becomes : how do we discharge that responsibility ?
and it was n't perfect . many children still died , but it was certainly better than what they had before .
but the worst thing about it was that you could n't use it on the youngest children , on infants , and on one-year-olds .
`` and so , he went forth to the people and he said , `` '' i 've made this wonderful finding : it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution , and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year , and we could spend that on our children in other ways . '' '' and the parents were very unhappy , and they said , `` '' this is a terrible thing , because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing ? '' '' and the government was very upset . ''
`` we would lose all of our market . '' '' and people were very angry , and they called him horrible names . ''
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
so , here is the data . here i have , among two- to six-year-olds — anyone above six , basically no one uses car seats , so you ca n't compare — 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies , themselves die .
so you can only get so far , i think , in telling your story by using these abstract statistics .
so this is going to be a crash where they 're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour , and see what happens . ok ?
so , let me show you what happens .
the car seat 's moving all over the place .
having a flat back makes it much easier to install them .
so this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from consumer reports , and did quite well .
the six-year-old is in a car seat , and it turns out that looks terrible , but that 's great . that 's like a 400 , ok ?
`` so i wrote him back and i said , `` '' what about an n of 45,004 ? '' '' because i had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes . ''
but essentially , do something like this , which i do n't know exactly how much it would cost to do , but there 's no reason i could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat .
`` people would look at these and say , `` '' man , this thing is so big and so hard to swallow . if this does n't make me feel better , you know , what possibly could ? '' '' and it turned out that most people would n't come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he 'd come back . and my dad had a third jar of pills . ''
is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective , or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury ? because that would prove your case . ) steven levitt : yeah , that 's a great question . in my data , and in another data set i 've looked at for new jersey crashes , i find very small differences in injury .
in the new jersey data , which is different , because it 's not just fatal crashes , but all crashes in new jersey that are reported , it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries , but generally they 're the minor injuries .
these skills and competencies can be summarized as business , strategic , and financial acumen .
here 's what i mean by that .
and then they pretty much stopped .
now , the second reason relates to tonya 's comments about having had excellent performance evals , great feedback from her teams , and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on .
so you would think that she 's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business , strategic and financial acumen , but here again , that green square is quite small .
he was very proud of the fact that last year , he had two protégés : a man and a woman .
so what this illustrates is that as managers , whether we 're women or men , we have mindsets about women and men , about careers in leadership , and these unexamined mindsets wo n't close the gender gap at the top .
but you do n't have to be a middle manager to do this .
it 's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions .
we love them anyway , and we stick to it , and that is what i did with my dog .
i met a monkey named boonlua , and when boonlua was a baby , he was attacked by a pack of dogs , and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm , and boonlua dragged himself to a monastery , where the monks took him in .
i do n't think , though , that that 's a problem .
one in five americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug , from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics .
they want to know how often your dog gets outside .
something 's going on .
what does that say about the minds of crayfish ?
mostly boiled .
i know i can trust him because we 're family .
humans not only can feel grief , we create an awful lot of it .
the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family .
this whale is t20 .
he had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions .
they eat seals .
why do n't they eat us ?

this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects .
these are some of the names that they have chosen , ladies and gentlemen .
`` `` it fluctus up , mama . '' ''
and that 's the tonga underworld .
and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus , who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects , stars , and planets .
this is from their rule book , the international astronomical union .
l'union astronomique internationale , for those of you who do n't speak french .
`` ( laughter ) it 's clear to me . '' '' `` listen , i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid . can you call me in a little while ? '' ( laughter ) ''
also , from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest .
anyone can suggest changing a name .
so , i look to you , fellow member of the earth community .
is that ganymede andromeda burba ? ( laughter )
i do n't know . but it 's investigative material , no doubt .
witness please , eugene shoemaker , who , diligently , from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies .
`` `` that 's wonderful eugene . you could make maps of toronto . '' ''
it 's definitely one of the two . i 'm not really clear which one .
that is the premise of this particular presentation .
here comes euler .
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
october 9th , in france , jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
but it did lead to newton discovering gravity .
ecuador , my friend kepler , as you can see , they call him juan .
because that 's why we 're here , really , i think to figure stuff out and to love each other .
look , ours is more red , it 's longer .
`` they stole our flag ! they stole our flag ! '' '' ( laughter ) bode 's law was n't even his law . it was a guy named titus . ''
( laughter ) prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites .
( laughter ) alright where is this going ? that 's a good question .
moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved .
that was the first chart i came up with .
( laughter ) i found other pairs all have symmetry , even though , unlike the master one , their symmetry is split .
so she 's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night , next day she 's got plumbers coming in , day after that , professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet .
winds up taking seven hours of her week .
seven hours .
`` `` could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people ? '' ''
well , first we need to figure out what they are .
what three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
but you can write it .
and now we need to break these down into doable steps .
it 's about looking at the whole of one 's time and seeing where the good stuff can go .
the first three things are about how i 've been curious about technology , design and art , and how they intersect , how they overlap , and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president of rhode island school of design : leadership .
it could show text and after we waited a bit , we had these things called images .
remember that excitement ?
and then the browser appeared . the browser was great , but the browser was very primitive , very narrow bandwidth .
we 're kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect , and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore , to give you a sense of what i used to do .
so i made a lot of work in the '90s .
so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time .
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this , and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself , so i had to hang up my mouse .
ten variations . this is , like , spin the letter around .
and many people ask me , john , could n't you just digitize all this ? make it all digital ? would n't it be better ?
and i have a good friend , he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa . he 's based in london , no , actually it 's in tokyo , but when he was based in london , he had a game with his wife . he would go to antique shops , and the game was as such : when we look at an antique we want , we 'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique , and if it 's a good story , we 'll buy it .
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , i 've spent my whole career making new media art .
it 's a hierarchy . we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it 's been disrupted .
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas , and so you might look in r & d , and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest , and it 's a person important to engage .
but there is an art form that 's been around for a very long time that 's really about using information , abstract information , to make emotionally resonant pieces .
and it 's called music .
we 've got a rainbow out the window . we 've got a sword .
`` and how you get there , from `` '' gentlemen '' '' to `` '' terror '' '' in 43 easy steps , tells us a lot about american history , and gives you a different insight than you would have looking at a series of paintings . ''
and so in 2010 , i decided to make my own census .
and it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that 's just sitting there for the taking .
this is the kinky map , so what this is showing you is that the women in alaska need to get together with the men in southern new mexico , and have a good time .
`` you 've got `` '' pretty . '' '' you 've got `` '' heartbreak . '' '' you 've got `` '' gig . '' '' you 've got `` '' cigarette . '' '' they play in a band and they smoke . ''
`` and this is gentrified north brooklyn , so you 've got `` '' dj '' '' and `` '' glamorous '' '' and `` '' hipsters '' '' and `` '' urbane . '' '' so that 's maybe a more democratic portrait . ''
this is a self-portrait .
sometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city .
( applause )
i have a question : who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die ?
our idea of death develops as we grow older .
now these studies are ingenious , but they 're simple .
you take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects , and you remind one group that they 're going to die but not the other , then you compare their behavior .
and these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations , but i believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take .
and we can see them repeating themselves throughout history , just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day .
but our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age , for example , with the idea of cryonics .
they find the body too messy , too unreliable to guarantee eternal life , and so they set their hopes on the third , more spiritual immortality story , the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul .
now , the majority of people on earth believe they have a soul , and the idea is central to many religions .
well the greek philosopher epicurus thought we could .
`` so 2,000 years later , another philosopher , ludwig wittgenstein , put it like this : `` '' death is not an event in life : we do not live to experience death . ''
`` and so , '' '' he added , `` in this sense , life has no end . '' ''
it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
so let 's start with — ( laughter ) jf : we 're in big trouble .
( laughter ) ( applause ) jf : you know , i was thinking this morning , i do n't even know what i would do without my women friends .
i do n't know about you . but anyway — ( laughter ) you know , they make me stronger , they make me smarter , they make me braver .
you know ? i mean , it 's nice — lt : thank you .
lt : no , i 'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me .
lt : well you have to use a lot of — jf : she does n't invite me over much , i 'll tell you that .
( laughter ) jf : such a purist .
i read a lot so , as lily knows all too well , my books that i like , i send to my friends .
`` lt : well , when you and i and dolly made `` '' 9 to 5 '' '' ... ''
do you think of your friends as spiritual ?
jf : well , there 's all kinds of friends .
`` i mean how many times have i asked you , `` '' am i doing ok ? '' '' `` did i really screw up there ? '' ''
and the answer is patriarchal culture , which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship , to be emotional with someone is girly .
`` there 's a quote that i really like , `` men fear that becoming 'we ' will erase his 'i ' . '' ''
jf : i know you know who she is , but i think it 's a — ( laughter ) no , but it 's a great quote , i think .
we are the ones that need to get off the grid .
you know , that the alternatives just are n't quite there yet , and that 's not true .
there are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine .
jf : and not drill in the alberta tar sands — right .
`` and the operative word here was `` '' male . '' '' because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal — jf : they did n't think we had souls even , the greeks . ''
( laughter ) and wait , no , here 's the best part .
lt : right .
jf : thank you .
the first question is this .
and hell is down here ? is it a cultural issue ?
or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark , gloomy place that has nothing to offer ?
mostly discoveries made by accident .
it is not a map .
all right . so we 're going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because , you know , it 's really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources on the continents .
you know , we 're going to do this , we 're going to take it away from something else .
and we 're leaving so much on the table , 72 percent of the planet .
why ? ok. now , i began my explorations the hard way .
back then — actually my first expedition was when i was 17 years old . it was 49 years ago .
`` i was a body surfer and i thought , `` '' wow , that was an incredible wave ! '' '' and we almost sank the ship , but i became enraptured with mounting expeditions . and over the last 49 years , i 've done about 120 , 121 — i keep doing them — expeditions . ''
it 's absolutely pitch black , because photons can not reach the average depth of the ocean , which is 12,000 feet . in the rift valley , it 's 9,000 feet .
tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
it 's not a flood , it was pushed up there .
we understood mountains under compression , but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension .
`` the pilot made this great observation : `` '' that 's hot . '' '' ( laughter ) and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff — it could have melted . but it turns out the exiting temperature was 650 degrees f , hot enough to melt lead . ''
none of it in our textbooks . none of this in our textbooks .
we did not know about this life system .
so , we wanted to accelerate this process .
we wanted to get away from this silly trip , up and down on a submarine : average depth of the ocean , 12,000 feet ; two and half hours to get to work in the morning ; two and half hours to get to home . five hour commute to work .
that did not make sense . they were not above a magma chamber .
so life was much more creative than we had ever thought .
again , discovered by accident . just two years ago working off santorini , where people are sunning themselves on the beach , unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby , we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems .
again , you know , we stop at the water 's edge .
near that was methane . i 've never seen volcanoes of methane .
moving on , there 's more than just natural history beneath the sea — human history . our discoveries of the titanic .
we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna .
you still see the beeswax dripping . when they dropped , they sealed it .
we own all of that blue and yet , like i say , particularly the western territorial trust , we do n't have maps of them . we do n't have maps of them .
so , we 're going to run it like an emergency hospital .
a discovery is made , that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later .
we can then build a command center .
the game is not over — it 's over by the eighth grade , it 's not beginning .
thank you very much .
so here i 'm — ( applause ) this is a fibonacci sequence that i 'm making with a simple equation program .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you do n't have to give people many instructions .
so here 's another few people trying it out .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
dm : it 's an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
dm : i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other . video : ( music )
so i do n't have to plan it out in advance , but i can improvise , making it longer or shorter as i go .
( applause )
what does this all mean for us ?
so when you think about this problem , what an enormous undertaking . where do you begin ?
this process is an engineering problem , a mechanical problem , a logistical problem , an operational problem .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
but what we 've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model .
so here what we 're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-d model space .
we do n't want iran to get the bomb .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
the gray boxes do n't run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
`` so i told my assistant , `` get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . '' ''
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
here 's some very cool stuff that we saw — really knocked my socks off .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
your plant can blow up .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the middle east .
they 're in the united states and europe and in japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your target-rich environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
( applause )
bali : island of garbage .
that 's about a 14-story building .
mw : we know that changes the image you may have of our island .
it changed ours , too , when we learned about it , when we learned that almost all plastic bags in bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean .
and we have had some significant successes .
iw : we started researching , and let 's just say , the more we learned , there was nothing good about plastic bags .
iw : but we have also learned much about patience , mw : how to deal with frustrations , iw : leadership , mw : teamwork , iw : friendship , mw : we learned more about the balinese and their culture iw : and we learned about the importance of commitment .
we learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals .
we check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone , and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on bali .
( laughter ) mw : so , why are we actually telling you all of this ?
and we also have more than five billion of these devices here .
there 's another problem .
i compared the radio waves spectrum — the size of it — with the size of the visible light spectrum .
so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum , let 's compare that with a number i 've just mentioned .
you all know remote controls have an infrared led — basically you switch on the led , and if it 's off , you switch it off .
what we 've done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
and i 'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator .
and what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
there 's a receiver .
still do n't believe ?
and if you do the energy budget , the data transmission comes for free — highly energy efficient .
if the whole world would deploy them , you would save hundreds of power plants .
it has a flashlight , an led flashlight .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
and you only have to notice , where we have light , there is a potential way to transmit data .
intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant — you ca n't use rf , it may generate antenna sparks , but you can use light — you see plenty of light there .
traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
so you could enjoy your most favorite ted video on your long flight back home .
and the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor .
the first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor .
so , electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material .
however , inside a superconductor there are no collisions , so there is no energy dissipation .
why ? because it is a quantum phenomenon . it 's quantum physics .
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor does n't like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the superconductivity state .
of course , i can turn it upside down , and it will remain locked .
you see ? i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor .
well , we can calculate it , and it turns out , quite a lot .
one hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk .
imagine you would have a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand , three-inch diameter , with a single difference .
i think it 's the most technologically literate thing that we have , and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them , touch them , help them think differently about things .
so for me , choreography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
usually , dance has a stimulus or stimuli , and i thought i 'd take something simple , ted logo , we can all see it , it 's quite easy to work with , and i 'm going to do something very simply , where you take one idea from a body , and it happens to be my body , and translate that into somebody else 's body , so it 's a direct transfer , transformation of energy .
strike moment .
so they 're solving this problem for me , having a little — they 're constructing that phrase .
here we go , ready ? and ... bam , bake ... ( clicks metronome ) great . okay , from there , you 're both getting up .
whoaa . just after it , maybe . whoaa , whaaay , ooh .
kick it out of the way . throw it into the audience . whoom .
throw it into the audience again .
if you reach with your elbow , where would it be ?
so , you 're going to do the first solo that we made , yeah blah blah blah blah , we go into the duet , yeah , blah blah blah blah . the next solo , blah blah blah blah , yeah , and both at the same time , you do the last solutions .
here we go . catarina , big moment , here we go , one .
( clicks metronome ) here it comes , cat . ( clicks metronome ) paolo , go . ( clicks metronome ) last you solo .
these are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider .
so we started exploring this material called etfe .
we 'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant .
so the final project i want to talk about is the sahara forest project , which we 're working on at the moment .
so an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters .
so this is how this scheme would look .
the next thing is sodium chloride .
it 's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy .
there are just three simple rules .
you 'll see — let 's see , it 's coming up possibly at the very end — maybe not .
we do n't , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
i 'm a mathematician . we would like to be able to understand better .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travelers , like sir francis drake , went to thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle .
we do n't see anything like this in europe or in the west .
it would be all atoms pulsating in unison , emitting light of one color , one frequency .
this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles .
i have some metronomes here .
we can try this first . if i just put them on the table together , there 's no reason for them to synchronize , and they probably wo n't .
maybe you 'd better listen to them . i 'll stand here .
so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that .
`` i 'm going to put them on a movable platform , which is the `` '' guide to graduate study at cornell . '' '' okay ? so here it is . ''
so i want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day , who will describe what happened .
interviewer : just sideways . about how much was it moving , do you think ?
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
boy : we had to do this because , to keep in balance because if you did n't keep your balance , then you would just fall over about , like , to the left or right , about 45 degrees .
they all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move .
but also , after you see the bridge on opening day , you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie , who figured out what happened on the bridge , and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was .
we 'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge , and we 'd analyzed it , we 'd checked it to codes — to heavier loads than the codes — and here it was doing something that we did n't know about .
interviewer : you did n't expect . engineer : exactly .
narrator : the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd — hundreds of people — apparently rocking from side to side in unison , not only with each other , but with the bridge .
but it 's often a lot more complicated than that .
( gunshot reverbs church ) or in a canyon .
listening to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on-screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we 're listening to a commentator , to an objective narrator that 's not participating in the on-screen action .
well , here 's a really big one .
so in a yin-yang way , silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect .
but even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds , you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood .
well , as a synonym , they often use ambiences .
so , birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality , perhaps because , as a species , we 've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years .
( birds chirp ) on the other hand , industrial sounds have been introduced to us a little more recently .
nuns in monasteries in rome and venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries close to the ceiling , creating the illusion that we 're listening to angels up in the sky .
on a personal level , i fell in love with that language a few years ago , and somehow managed to make it into some sort of profession .
now kaesava had a baby boy called rehan a couple of weeks ago .
it caused so much trouble for me .
i was so upset .
you know , the 9/11 cartoon upset me so much that i decided i 'll never cartoon again .
one of the most important things in my 200-year plan that netra and i write is what to forget about ourselves .
we actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems .
maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves .
and it really informs my painting .
and what a bang it started my career with ! you know , when we think of time in this way , we can curate not only the future but also the past .
i was so inspired .
i went and created my own version of indian history .
you know , if this is so , it occurred to me that maybe , just maybe , the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity .
go tell facebook to figure that out !
it really teaches us who we are , and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world , but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am .
that 's the million-dollar question , right ?
give me predictability , give me surprise .
or in other words , i sometimes say , fire needs air .
desire needs space .
`` `` i turn off my desires when ... '' ''
it starts very young .
responsibility and desire just butt heads .
`` ( laughter ) i said , `` '' chris , that would take a miracle . '' '' he said , `` '' bono , would n't that be a good use of your messianic complex ? '' '' so , yeah . ''
since the year 2000 , since the turn of the millennium , there are eight million more aids patients getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs .
seven thousand kids a day . here 's two of them .
give it up for that . ( applause ) halved . halved .
that 's amazing .
it 's called momentum .
it 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff .
so let me tell you about the u-report , which i 'm really excited about . it 's 150,000 millennials all across uganda , young people armed with 2g phones , an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what 's in the budget and how their money is being spent .
this is exciting stuff .
you can erase that , you really can , because it 's not true anymore . ( applause ) it 's transformational .
so i 'm here to — i guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data-based virus , the one we call factivism .
that 's basically , if you hold two fists together , it 's just slightly larger than the two fists .
towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought , decision making — it 's the last to mature in late adulthood .
so if you take a deeper look at the brain , one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section , what you can see is that you ca n't really see a whole lot of structure there .
you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
but you can also see things underneath there as well .
the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry .
these are proteins .
they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
so we sent our lab technician out .
because what we 're trying to measure , the rna — which is the readout from our genes — is very labile , and so we have to move very quickly .
it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data .
this maps the large cabling in the brain .
so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments .
from this , we 're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces , which then we can put on a smaller cryostat .
and remember , it 's frozen .
so the technician takes the instructions .
they scribe along a place there .
and then the laser actually cuts .
you can see that blue dot there cutting . and that tissue falls off .
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you , but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
so if you want to understand the action of drugs , you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to , and also in the ways you do n't want them to .
and we get confirmation .
one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can , because it 's a pattern matching exercise , because there 's unique fingerprint , we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .
they can start to look at common pathways — other things that they simply have n't been able to do before .
and what we 're finding is actually , even at the brain biochemical level , we are quite similar .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
i 'm just one woman with a story to tell .
i was 22. i had just graduated from harvard college .
it may even be your story .
i 've spent most of my career working for fortune 500 companies including johnson & johnson , leo burnett and the washington post .
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
i met conor on a cold , rainy january night .
we started dating , and he loved everything about me , that i was smart , that i 'd gone to harvard , that i was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy .
but those guns were really a message for me , and even though he had n't raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and i got frustrated , and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window .
and then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold big mac in my face .
conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
the other question everybody asks is , why does n't she just leave ?
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
`` right now , maybe you 're thinking , `` wow , this is fascinating , '' or , `` '' wow , how stupid was she , '' '' but this whole time , i 've actually been talking about you . ''
i 'm still breaking the silence today .
it 's my way of helping other victims , and it 's my final request of you .
( applause )
this is from marlboro country .
and also , again , it can — also , it 's something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
hopefully , they will come .
one of the — ( applause ) thank you for inviting us .
and today is emmanuel 's day , i think we 've agreed that , already , have n't we ?
`` do n't go through this . do n't do it . '' '' ( laughter ) i 'm worried . when i first got the invitation , they said somewhere in the thing , they said , `` '' 15 minutes to change the world , your moment onstage . '' '' 15 minutes to change the world . ''
( laughter ) so , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one .
well , of course now we know we do n't have to change a plug , now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric — fantastic . you know , it inspires us .
fantastic . really good .
her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course , the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this — we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well .
`` and i think , `` '' i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh . '' '' ( laughter ) this man has swum around the north pole , what more evidence do you want ? ( laughter ) ''
but we 're in a new world now . we 're in a completely new world .
this is the first time that i can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him , or if he 's borrowing money from you .
these extraordinary things , icelandic internet accounts .
`` that 's why the prime minister went on television . he said , `` '' this has left us all with a very big haddock . '' '' ( laughter ) a lot of what i do — i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them . ''
`` he was speaking at a dinner , he said , `` wall street got drunk . '' ''
you like that one ? as opposed to you could see george bush , well , what 's the metaphor there ?
`` i 'm right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well . '' '' ( laughter ) but , you know , he 's gone . now he 's gone . ''
`` do you remember that ? george bush , `` '' a nu-ca-ler . '' '' sorry , what ? `` `` a nu-ca-ler . '' '' ( laughter ) could you say `` '' avuncular '' '' ? `` `` avunclear . '' '' ( laughter ) thank you very much . ''
`` `` '' travels the world . '' '' ( laughs ) `` i believe , i believe it was president dwight d. eisenhower who said ... '' ''
`` `` '' make this world a better place , if you can . ''
`` why would i need a bloody water feature ? '' '' ( laughter ) very quickly : i was n't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the `` '' japanese essays on idleness '' '' which said it 's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth . ''
thank you very much indeed .
but it 's only 50 years old . it was invented in 1959 .
so what i want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are , tell you why i think we would expect humans to have pheromones , tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones , and then finally , i want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going .
but the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you could n't identify the molecules .
`` with that new concept , we needed a new word , and that was the word `` '' pheromone , '' '' and it 's basically transferred excitement , transferred between individuals , and since 1959 , pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom , in male animals , in female animals . ''
so we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom .
along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits , new glands start to secrete in those places , and that 's what 's making the change in smell .
there are , indeed , problems .
liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries .
it 's really hard , but in essence , nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors , and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors , and if they bond , they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain .
when they 're secreted from the glands , the molecules are odorless .
so it does n't apply to 20 percent of the world .
i 'm fairly convinced that we do have them .
they 're in france , and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we 've put a clean glass rod .
there could be all sorts of medical interventions .
there 's lots to find .
i mean , it had to . right ? i was in for quite a surprise .
i watched everything that i 'd built crumbling , and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing .
i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day , every day , for 18 months .
well , in the end , we were able to save future and snowball , but i was , at that point , ready to move on .
and i discovered that while i 'd been busy playing business games , there 'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest : cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed .
and among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before , they found one species that caught their attention very quickly .
forest products are all around us .
apart from all those products , the forest is very important for climate regulation .
just the amazon pumps to the atmosphere 20 billion tons of water every day .
now , we used to have six billion hectares of forest — 50 percent more than what we have — 2,000 years ago .
so think of this : in 100 years , we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in 2,000 years in temperate forests .
and all the information is fully transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems .
( applause ) so if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade , we saved 8.7 million hectares , which is the size of austria .
so it 's a good lesson for us .
if we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in brazil , we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world .
that 's our next step .
and when we were there we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in canada .
so i decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change , find a way to think and understand the challenge , and go from there .
now the emissions today are 50 billion tons , and it 's growing .
it 's such a big problem , so complex . can we really do it ?
second , we have to move the incentives to the right place .
fourth , we need to leapfrog the routes of development , which means , you do n't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones .
and i 'm here for the other misfits in the room , because i 'm never the only one .
somewhere in my early 30s , the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep .
who was i ?
it was pretty much in spite of myself that i got on that plane and flew to new york city , where the writers are .
i can pick you out of a room .
ask me how fancy .
audience : how fancy ?
lidia yuknavitch : i 'm making a confession : i stole three linen napkins — ( laughter ) from three different restaurants .
and i shoved a menu down my pants .
these were not famous , best-selling authors , but to me , they were women-writer titans .
and he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
next , they took me to the offices of w.w. norton , where i was pretty sure i 'd be escorted from the building just for wearing doc martens .
i stood there and i kind of went deaf .
memory was the only prize i allowed myself .
and i became a teacher .
guess who my favorite students are .
thank you .
i could n't have done better .
what i want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that 's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst , for lack of a better word , over the past couple of years , and basically , these three quotes tell what 's going on .
we 're , in a sense , failing to act in the future . we 're purposefully , consciously being laggards .
i took art and ceramics . i loved dance .
or do i go to medical school ?
orchestral arranging is constructive .
they use analysis as well .
and then you have artists , and you all know this is true as well , artists will say things about scientists because they say they 're too concrete , they 're disconnected with the world .
intuitive versus analytical ?
our understanding is our science , our arts , our religion , how we see the universe around us , our resources , our money , our labor , our minerals , those things that are out there in the world we have to work with .
one of the things that i found out is that there 's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well . my mother always told me , you have to be observant , know what 's going on in your mind and your body , and as a dancer i had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as i knew how to sense colors .
that 's what i want to do , is to try to use bioinstrumentation , those kind of things to help our senses in what we do , and that 's the work i 've been doing now as a company called biosentient corporation .
let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating , to think about that intuitive and that analytical .
the balance . thank you very much .
is there a general purpose technology of our era ?
if anything , all these numbers actually understate our progress , because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production .
according to the numbers , the music industry is half the size that it was 10 years ago , but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever .
i 'm optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
in the age of big data , we can measure the world in ways we never could before .
put them together , and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs , like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound .
it 's applying for legal , banking and medical jobs , and getting some of them .
like the first two industrial revolutions , the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out , but they are staggering .
productivity is at an all time high , but fewer people now have jobs .
technology is racing ahead , but it 's leaving more and more people behind .
`` turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did , but it 's faster , cheaper and more accurate . '' '' how can a skilled worker compete with a $ 39 piece of software ? ''
she ca n't .
( applause )
for instance , this is herbert with his grandmother .
chris anderson : kirsten , will you just take one minute , just to tell your own story of how you got to africa ?
and i was constantly reading the new york times , and stunned by the statistics , the numbers .
it was just frightening .
right ? so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys , right ?
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
and so to think again , there 's no reason that you should believe me , so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on , but you might want to take it out , your iphone .
they do . they spend on the marketing part .
it was even , god forbid , being a venture capitalist .
but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics , but not really providing that sort of high-risk , revolutionary thinking out of the box .
darpa , that funded the internet and siri , actually thought really hard about this , how to welcome failure , because you will fail .
if the state is more than just a market fixer , if it actually is a market shaper , and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk , what happened to the reward ?
now , we do n't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker .
the brazilian development bank , which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology , they just announced a $ 56 billion program for the future on this , is retaining equity in these investments .
( applause )
and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened .
but the other thing they needed was speed .
programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer , some source code , and the computer it 's meant to run on , but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it 's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute , and that 's if one person is writing it .
`` now , for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem , which is to use something called a `` '' version control system , '' '' and a version control system does what is says on the tin . ''
the only programmers who can change it are people who 've specifically been given permission to access it , and they 're only allowed to access the sub-section of it that they have permission to change .
the corporation owns the software .
when you adopt a tool , you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool , and he was n't going to adopt anything that did n't work the way the linux community worked .
and to give you a sense of how enormous a decision like this was , this is a map of the internal dependencies within linux , within the linux operating system , which sub-parts of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going .
but this is also the thing that brings the chaos back , and this is git 's second big innovation .
this is the big change .
once git allowed for cooperation without coordination , you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex .
this looks like a dis-org chart , and yet , out of this community , but using these tools , they can now create something together .
now , i would love to tell you that the fact that the open-source programmers have worked out a collaborative method that is large scale , distributed , cheap , and in sync with the ideals of democracy , i would love to tell you that because those tools are in place , the innovation is inevitable . but it 's not .
we have them . we 've seen them . they work .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
`` or `` '' how was your trip to albania ? '' '' or something like that . ''
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it 's a bad story .
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
the gallup organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
you have that much uncertainty .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
( laughter ) and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you . i 've got a question for you .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
thank you , danny kahneman .
you take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels .
but this is it , this is the oil in the world .
now , here 's another little secret i 'm going to tell you about : for the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems .
gasoline consumption in the u.s. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining .
well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for starters .
it 's about 400 million years old .
and it 's just limestone , nothing really special about it .
now , millions of abalone every year make this shell .
oh , by the way , just in case you were n't already guessing , it 's calcium carbonate .
the oil will never run out .
it 's because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas — they had ideas , innovations , technology — and the stone age ended , not because we ran out of stones .
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .
on the lips . nibble the ears maybe .
it 's the face where we 're attracted to with that .
she 's also in danger , when she damages this , of bleeding profusely .
`` should n't you be doing something about this ? why have n't you had it removed ? '' '' and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion , because — a natural curiosity . ''
he looks pretty good at this stage .
he ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it .
it took 23 hours . i did it with my neurosurgeon .
when they have facial surgery , they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people .
their identity does n't change .
it 's been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces .
we think we can judge people on their expressions .
but are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement ?
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do — where we 're at and where we 're going .
this is what ann wants . she wants to be out kayaking , she wants to be out climbing mountains .
they have an increased risk of infection , an increased risk of malignancy .
bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin , who did the first operation , are studying that .
so the better news is the future 's almost here — and the future is tissue engineering .
( laughter ) tonight , i want to talk about a tale of two cities .
america comes second .
so in short , the question we have tonight is , how do we understand this mega-change , which i believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century ?
it 'll affect so many things .
it will go to the absolute core .
so very early on , i discovered that in fact , working in a farm was not designed for me , and china was a very safe remove from any career in australian farm life .
that 's my mom .
anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do ?
`` and she said , `` '' understand this , learn this , because it 's going to affect your future . '' '' so being a very good student of history , i decided that the best thing for me to do was , in fact , to go off and learn chinese . ''
it needed to be a little more elegant , a little more classical , so i rendered it as follows .
he 's not chinese and he 's not american .
`` `` '' it was the rise of athens and the fear that this inspired in sparta that made war inevitable . '' '' and hence , a whole literature about something called the thucydides trap . ''
this guy is an american . his name 's graham allison .
`` [ `` '' no dogs and chinese allowed '' '' ] how would you feel if you were chinese , in your own country , if you saw that sign appear ? ''
china also believes that it is being contained by u.s. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u.s .
the u.s. and the west say china cheats on the question of intellectual property rights , and through cyberattacks on u.s. and global firms .
what do i mean by that ?
this was a day of reckoning in the australian government , the australian parliament , and for the australian people .
kr : thank you . thank you , folks .
this is one of the ways that vaccines are carried : these are styrofoam chests . these are being carried by people , but they 're also put on the backs of pickup trucks .
now , one of these styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it .
and we thought , well , that 's not really good enough .
so we hope this year to prototype each of these devices .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you did n't have to draw the blood .
and using both this technique and other optical techniques , we think we can make those diagnostics .
okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
this is malaria spreading across madagascar .
we 're going to the dry season now .
here , we 're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we 're illuminating with a laser .
( laughter ) now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .
and we 're going to show you , instead of the kill laser , which will be a very brief , instantaneous pulse , we 're going to have a green laser pointer that 's going to stay on the mosquito for , actually , quite a long period of time ; otherwise , you ca n't see it very well .
eric johanson : what we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage .
now , that 's a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works .
nm : that 's a mosquito wing beat you 're hearing .
( applause ) nm : so it would n't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em .
and then next we have to provide training , capacity building .
but it was n't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame — what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it .
literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings .
his mother died when he was only nine years old ; his only sister , sarah , in childbirth a few years later ; and his first love , ann rutledge , at the age of 22 .
and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide .
he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights .
and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language , in metaphors , in stories .
`` he said , `` '' if ever my soul were in an act , it is in this act . ''
`` but if i sign with a shaking hand , posterity will say , 'he hesitated . ' '' '' so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand . ''
the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life , when i helped him on his memoirs , was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work , power and individual success , that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone .
not that peculiar — there were only three women out of the 16 white house fellows .
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house .
for in the months leading up to my selection , like many young people , i 'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement , and had written an article against lyndon johnson , which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house .
a victor in a thousand contests , three great civil rights laws , medicare , aid to education .
and because he was so sad and so vulnerable , he opened up to me in ways he never would have had i known him at the height of his power — sharing his fears , his sorrows and his worries .
and i 'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure , that i 've tried to bring to each of my books since then .
so as for that third sphere of play , which he never had learned to enjoy , i 've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy — enough so that a hobby , a sport , a love of music , or art , or literature , or any form of recreation , can provide true pleasure , relaxation and replenishment .
and they 're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument .
they figured he 'd be upset about the indignity of george washington being in an outhouse .
and i was so excited — first person i 'd ever see outside of ebbets field .
but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church .
`` he said , `` '' no problem . it was n't a religious service . '' '' but then , unfortunately , he said , `` '' and what else , my child ? '' '' and then came my second sin . ''
but luckily , my first confession — to a baseball-loving priest !
video : narrator : an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
according to relevant researchers , 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press .
so i can go back to my story .
and we all had all of that on tapes .
i would think media systems were organizations , which means they should help you .
and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times .
and basically what i was saying is very simple .
( laughter ) i knew two things after that meeting .
you see , at the level of a concept , it was a great concept .
but it 's one thing to have a concept ; it 's a totally separate thing to actually make it work .
they want to — the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press .
we start the meeting .
and i can , but i 'll give you just , maybe one , and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with .
in the south of russia there 's a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin , who is running an independent newspaper there .
can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months , because i have elections — there are elections coming up in nine months .
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries .
it 's actually just a drop in the sea .
so from that perspective , what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .
now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room .
now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left .
you can , once you have all of those different points , you can make it easy for investors .
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click .
what do investors get ?
on one side financial , on the other side social .
i 'd like to talk to you today about this problem , and how we can fix it with neuroscience .
and just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation , of course , his phone lights up .
he was swiping through pictures on instagram , and these kids were laughing hysterically .
and i think computers today are doing quite the opposite .
you 're hunched over these rectangles , fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles .
now it just so happens that i have such a machine here .
it 's called the meta 2 .
we 're going to come back to this in just a bit .
we 're building a system that you 've always known how to use .
we 're going against the neural path of least resistance .
you could put your holographic tesla that you 're shopping for — or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show .
and that 's exactly how the natural machine should work as well .
and this leads me to our third guideline , the holographic campfire from our first story .
so if you look at the video behind me , you can see two meta users playing around with the same hologram , making eye contact , connected around this thing , instead of being distracted by external devices .
let 's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind .
thank you so much .
it 's right here , inside of us .
thank you very much .
thanks , guys .
we want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we 're actually seeing through the glasses , and not cut any corners .
now let 's ask ourselves , what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future ?
in fact , this is exactly the kind of question we 're faced with when we try to understand the indus valley civilization , which existed 4,000 years ago .
well obviously this is a replica .
in fact , we do n't even know what any of these objects say , and that 's because the indus script is undeciphered .
now that 's a magnificent piece of art .
we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other .
we need to decipher the script to answer that question .
if you look at a map of india today , you 'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo-european language family .
these people believe that the indus script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of south india today .
but deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
so as i showed you , they 're usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
and so given these formidable obstacles , one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the indus script .
my career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist , so in my day job , i create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions , how the brain makes decisions , how the brain learns and so on .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
language , on the other hand , has an intermediate level of entropy ; it 's neither too rigid , nor is it too random .
the same thing happens in the case of the indus script .
the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the indus script probably does represent language .
that 's our next big challenge .
can you write it using pictures ?
i 'll give you a couple seconds .
and it turns out that in india there 's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .
these are our ancestors — yours and mine .
they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history .
if we decipher the script , we would enable them to speak to us again .
pleurobot can walk , as you can see here , and as you 'll see later , it can also swim .
and my goal is to understand how this works .
and this is exactly the purpose of pleurobot .
that 's what we did .
and then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot .
and this is how pleurobot came to life .
and here , we were very happy , because this is difficult to do .
so here what we did with jean-marie cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits .
so what you see here is a previous version of pleurobot that 's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot .
and what 's interesting is , by playing with these signals , we can completely control speed , heading and type of gait .
the last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb , so to handle impacts and forces .
and this is how we designed cheetah-cub .
but to do this properly , it 's very important to understand how the spinal cord works , how it interacts with the body , and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord .
thank you .
bg : thank you very much . thank you and your team .
hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident , but not everybody accepted that fate .
i mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?
the world health organization puts the number of chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000 , eventually .
now radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives .
( music ) ( singing ) come on , josh ! ( music ) ( singing )
and this process goes on and on and on .
those tribal societies , which constituted all human societies for most of human history , are far more diverse than are our modern , recent , big societies .
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the new guinea farming societies where i 've been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world .
and they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
there are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people .
in fact , they 're usually the people who are best at it .
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society 's treatment of the elderly .
another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age , because older people , their children , and their friends , all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives .
older people have that experience .
there are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small , traditional societies .
i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies .
i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind .
`` whereas some of you might have thought , `` hmm , black would have been so much more slimming . '' ''
and this way of thinking is known as fatphobia .
when it came to doing our first performance , i was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu .
( applause ) and although i did n't recognize it at the time , claiming space for myself in that glorious fourfour was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist .
because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia .
it 's called the human immune system .
the components do n't really matter .
the point is that together , this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up .
you have the surface barrier of the human skin , you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system .
the point is , that if one system fails , another can take over , creating a virtually foolproof system .
it 's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it 's never even met before .
and bob may say something like , i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation , blah blah blah — ( laughter ) but honestly , it 's total nonsense .
this beautiful building is part of the shitennoji temple complex in osaka , japan .
amazingly , his company , kongō gumi , was still around 1,428 years later .
and when the bubble burst , it could n't refinance its loans .
how was this possible ?
the ball would head in a straight line , probably towards the intended target , and the bird certainly would not .
`` they were n't in a and b at all ; they were completely new texts by archimedes , and they were called `` '' the method '' '' and `` '' the stomachion . '' '' and it became a world famous manuscript . ''
now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
he wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous .
the top half is elmer 's wood glue .
the archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another .
with this kind of imaging — this kind of infrared , ultraviolet , invisible light imaging — we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries .
it took about 17 minutes to do a single page .
he was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits and still make a perfect square .
`` the one battle that the spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of thermopylae where they were butchered to a man , but fought for the freedom of greece . '' '' it was such a great speech that the athenian law courts let him off . ''
now i should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you do n't find unique texts .
now all this data that we collected , all the images , all the raw images , all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a creative commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose .
( applause ) why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
and it 's an attractive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
how would people describe your judgment , your knowledge , your behaviors , in different situations ?
now , i mention squeak because sebastian 's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen , and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition : he got a cat .
the pink dots represent host properties .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
we 're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share , swap , rent , barter or trade just about anything . we 're sharing our cars on whipcar , our bikes on spinlister , our offices on loosecubes , our gardens on landshare . we 're lending and borrowing money from strangers on zopa and lending club .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
and 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed .
how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities ? do we want them to be the same ?
how do we stop people who 've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise ?
in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan , or the rate of a mortgage , marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eggs , and that device is reputation .
this year , two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms .
now , capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge , but one we 're being asked to figure out .
what the likes of sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is , should n't they own their reputation data ?
just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
but the bigger principle of what 's happening behind stack overflow , i think , is incredibly exciting .
when you talk to super-users , whether that 's superrabbits or super-people on stack overflow , or uberhosts , they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power .
now at the end of my tea with sebastian , he told me how , on a bad , rainy day , when he has n't had a customer in his bookstore , he thinks of all the people around the world who 've said something wonderful about him , and what that says about him as a person .
yet we consider it a taboo .
we feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives , and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .
and then there 's , of course , the example that we 're all too aware of : financial experts getting it so wrong that we 're living through the worst recession since the 1930s .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
what has your investigation focused on ?
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
the conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees , fancy titles , diplomas , best-selling books — high-status individuals .
because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .
hi everyone .
( laughter ) shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
in fact , when there was a wedding in our neighborhood , all of us would paint our houses for the wedding .
it was a very beautiful time .
`` my little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in , and he says , `` '' rags , rags . ''
i have another idea .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
`` and similar to `` '' double rainbow , '' '' it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere . ''
well tosh.0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
( laughter ) unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon — either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
cats were watching other cats watch this video . ( laughter )
there were remixes .
`` who could have predicted `` '' double rainbow '' '' or rebecca black or `` '' nyan cat ? '' '' what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ? ''
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
( video ) casey niestat : so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true .
so we were thinking , well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .
so what that means is , one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button .
that 's very practical and extremely awesome .
ela : let me tell you a little bit about where books come from .
and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago .
since then , the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions , publishing books .
we said , well instead of releasing the full text , we 're going to release statistics about the books .
what do they tell us ?
now this is just two out of two billion rows .
so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide .
( laughter ) ( applause ) jm : now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
( laughter ) but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 . ( laughter )
if it 's very large , maybe you 're benefiting from propaganda .
what you expect is basically what you observe .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome .
here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
`` we have to make this available for people . '' '' so in two weeks flat — the two weeks before our paper came out — they coded up a version of the ngram viewer for the general public . ''
this person was interested in the history of frustration .
there 's various types of frustration .
`` if you stub your toe , that 's a one a `` '' argh . '' '' if the planet earth is annihilated by the vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass , that 's an eight a `` '' aaaaaaaargh . '' '' this person studies all the `` '' arghs , '' '' from one through eight a 's . ''
( laughter ) jm : there are many usages of this data , but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized .
google has started to digitize 15 million books .
that 's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published .
each dance has steps that everyone can agree on , but it 's about the individual and their creative identity .
the present always contains the past .
but what if it becomes a worldwide craze ?
enter the twist .
`` we exist and we are free . '' '' ''
after all , what 's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line ca n't even afford to buy one ?
`` bao yongxiu : `` '' my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i marry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only marry an ordinary worker , so i 'm not in a rush . '' '' chen ying : `` '' when i went home for the new year , everyone said i had changed . they asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ? ''
what a factory makes is never the point , and the workers could not care less who buys their products .
`` min 's sister said to her parents , `` in america , this bag sells for 320 dollars . '' ''
they were n't exactly worthless , but they were nothing close to the actual value , because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one , or knew how much it was worth .
six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair .
`` they were fresh , functional , and women everywhere adored them . a new american classic was born . '' '' i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters . ''
this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine , sitting in your office or in the library , are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world .
leslie chang : one minute ?
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
he had misheard me and thought i was coming up because i was trying to make a poster , and so was n't prepared to take me into the mines .
( video ) ray : it was crease limestone , and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice , warm , sunny atmosphere .
but anyway , the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was — there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug .
so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
but i considered it a partial success , to be honest .
for example , if there were a multinational organization , government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board , not one woman could have a decision-making authority , not one woman could handle any financial matter , we would have outrage .
i have been fighting for the equal rights amendment , which has been dead for 40 years .
i was the kind of religious where everyone i know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
these seem like simple things , but to us , the organizers , they were enormously costly .
we were attacked in social media and national press .
and what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in , because we 're not stupid .
and that 's the mindset that we 're dealing with , and criticism does not change that .
and so my parents and i have been walking this tightrope , explaining our sides , respecting one another , but actually invalidating each other 's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives , and it 's been difficult .
and we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules , or we can ask ourselves , why is gender inequality the default around the world ?
right now , women 's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time .
women are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings , and they never were before in the general conferences .
i 'm working on my people . what are you doing for yours ?
i did n't know when i agreed to do this whether i was expected to talk or to sing .
and it is a very weird thing , because proper nouns are the worst .
it 's clunky , but you can get away with it , because over time i 've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain .
but with people 's names , you ca n't change them .
but as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real , that feels often like cheating .
it 's more than making you feel the things that i feel .
somehow , through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain , it 's impossible to stutter when you sing .
`` who 's been there ? say , `` '' aye . '' '' audience : aye . ''
red = drums , blue = bass , green = chords , orange = leads , purple = pads the mouthpiece consists of ...
right . class , let 's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin .
( laughter ) also , do n't forget , we are reading the book module for next week 's focus on gender .
and also , how many people have your emotional shunts engaged ?
all right . i understand . if you 're unwilling to — all right , well , we can discuss that after class .
all right , we will discuss your concerns .
no , sweetheart , i said , i 'm ready when you are .
i 'm freezing .
it 's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio .
i should have brought a shmata .
i ca n't hear you through the glass , honey !
are you soliciting me , young man ?
sure . so about the prostitution — oh , sex worker , sex worker .
like you would say , with the extreme sports .
lots of endurance , but never tenderness .
`` so anyway , needless to say , that was $ 19.95 i 'll never get back again , but it only showed up on the credit card as `` '' entertainment services , '' '' so my husband was never the wiser , and after all of that , well , you could say it turned out he did n't need the extra inspiration after all . ''
okay . okay .
like , i support other women 's right to choose it voluntarily , like , if they enjoy it .
my family is from trinidad and the virgin islands .
well , for your record , my opinion of the legalization , i 'd say i 'm against it .
so there 's that shame piece we 've heard about .
i 'm trying to talk to bert right now .
yeah , and i totally believe in causes , yeah , like , all that stuff .
of course i believe in women 's rights . i 'm marrying a woman .
my fiancee is totally amazing , she 's totally a strong girl , woman , smart woman , like , the whole thing .
yeah , we all went to b school together .
yeah , but , you ca n't blame the media , either .
but also , you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them , but you can , like , kill them and take your money back .
and it turns out he 's alone in town for the night , driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the peace corps .
`` and he makes it worse by saying , `` actually , i do n't have a place . '' ''
do i offer to host this guy ?
this was my first hosting experience , and it completely changed my perspective .
but they loved it , and so did we .
because we 've all been taught as kids , strangers equal danger .
now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left .
now , how does it feel holding someone 's unlocked phone ?
what if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment ?
what if your neighbor had introduced themselves first , with their name , where they 're from , the name of their kids or their dog ?
the research showed , not surprisingly , we prefer people who are like us .
the more different somebody is , the less we trust them .
this is what happens when a guest first messages a host .
we use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing .
and when trust works out right , it can be absolutely magical .
we had a guest stay with a host in uruguay , and he suffered a heart attack .
they will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you 're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass .
so let 's be clear ; it is about commerce .
what if anywhere you visited , there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you did n't even know existed .
hospitality has been around forever .
there 's been many other websites like ours .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures .
it really changed my life totally .
i had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper .
we 're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .
and they did this incredible ritual combat dance .
so , the tiger is the icon .
all the major rivers in south india are sourced in the western ghats , the chain of hills running along the west coast of india .
you drink it in peril of your life .
so , in fact at this point there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild .
the chambal , if you look at it , has clear water .
it 's a place that 's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits , the dacoits who used to work up there . and there still are quite a few around .
we 're still working hard at it .
and the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders .
and these are powerful water totems .
`` and when the average person looks at a cobra going `` '' ssssss ! '' '' like that , they say , `` '' my god , look at that angry , dangerous creature . '' '' i look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being . ''
but this guy who we 're following right now is in the deep jungle .
whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface , you know , the plantations , to find big rat snakes and stuff .
( applause )
it opens our hearts , and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we 're not separate from it .
`` the `` '' oh '' '' means it caught your attention , makes you present , makes you mindful . ''
`` it creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard . and `` '' god '' '' ? ''
did you know that 80 percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes ?
we all go back so far , and in this present moment , on this day , all the people you meet , all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life-giving water , if you only open your heart and drink .
and so this is a very serious problem .
we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average ...
at the present time , it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient , before that patient arrives at an emergency room .
mortality : 300,000 people dying each year .
then we tried it with my son , dr. tim fischell , we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in .
next to it , at 30 seconds , you see this rise here , then this rise — that 's the st elevation .
so we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig , and let me show you the result that 's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned .
can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the qrs — you see st elevation ?
you wait as burns and other critical patients are treated , because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains do n't have ami , so you 're not taken very seriously .
`` we 're going to send him the signal that we have , that says you have a heart attack , and we 're going to send the signal to the hospital and we 're going to have it analyzed there , and there you 're going to be with your doctor and you 'll be taken care of so you wo n't die of a heart attack . '' '' that 's the first invention that i wanted to describe . ''
and , by god , the neurologist did erase it , and that 's the middle picture : half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse .
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches — and there are 30 million americans who do — tonight : a possible answer .
and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
( applause ) the third and last invention began with an idea .
form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy , as well as other diseases of the brain , because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it , that causes many , if not all , of brain disorders .
and then with four screws , we put in a frame , then we snap in the device and we run with wires — the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes , to the epileptic focus , the origin of the epilepsy , where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure .
and this shows what an electroencephalogram is , and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients .
in other words , if you 've screwed up electrical signals , maybe , by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain , we can counteract that .
and that is the second wish .
( applause ) well , the third and final wish is somewhat — unfortunately , it 's much more complicated because it involves lawyers .
( laughter ) well , medical malpractice litigation in the us has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance , so that competent physicians are leaving their practice .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
then there 's a simpler one and , oh yes , i understand that .
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
within five weeks , you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles .
this all started when i was age five .
so i decided i did n't really want to be a part of that world .
`` and i thought , `` '' these ants , are they looking for the queen ant ? ''
`` or do they need somewhere to live ? '' '' so i thought `` '' perhaps , if i made these ants some apartments , they 'll move in . '' '' ( laughter ) so i did . ''
and how i set about that , i got some splinters of wood .
the instrument that i used turned into a catapult .
and i decided to build it up .
and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed .
( applause ) ( laughter ) right . as you can see , bart simpson is having a little argument .
and charlton heston is made of a floating fiber , which i took out of the air .
( laughter ) and then she looked at me .
to get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult , because i had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
well , i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this , because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of , you know , the beginning of people coming to america .
because we know we see needles , but people are n't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it .
and that 's how i managed to do it .
but i had to rig it with strands of glue .
constructed each plank of gold .
vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
`` when charles darwin went across the atlantic in 1832 on the beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , `` '' these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . '' '' ( laughter ) you could not get a worse insult , and that from charles darwin . ( laughter ) you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and i 'll tell you why . ''
they 've also be associated with disney — ( laughter ) — personified as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
they are bird-blending machines .
you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well , the arts community , the music community .
even justin bieber fans are represented here .
how cool is that ?
so what is a city ?
thank you very much .
great — google away .
how does this work ?
so , you 've got those two and you get a search result like this — almost .
and that picture was published all over .
almost 80 people died that day .
he blew up those buildings , he shot those kids , and he sat down and waited for the world to google him .
let 's see if we can distort that .
strangely enough , google did n't intervene this time .
it 's on this side of the brain .
so if you look around the stage here you 'll create a kind of mental map of the stage .
and it 's the part that feels .
well , again , the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at .
many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
the lessons for us are three-fold .
and the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence .
here what we can do is look at sustainability , quite literally .
so a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen .
but unlike gitmo they exist right here , at home , floating within larger federal prisons .
he was arrested in 2004 as part of an fbi sting .
the cmus also include some non-muslim prisoners .
in mcgowan 's case , he was previously at a low-security prison and he had no communications violations .
this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed .
so how could i possibly be approved to visit ?
three months after our visit , mcgowan was transferred out of the cmu and then , without warning , he was sent back again .
ok , do n't actually do it . ( laughter )
and i found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking .
maybe .
( laughter ) i looked at medical students ' grades — even salespeople 's revenue . ( laughter )
but actually , it turns out there 's a twist here , because givers are often sacrificing themselves , but they make their organizations better .
so givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team , and then , unfortunately , they suffer along the way .
well , most people are matchers .
( laughter ) his name is adam rifkin .
`` you just have to find small ways to add large value to other people 's lives . '' '' that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other . ''
we can make it easier for people to ask for help .
a couple colleagues and i studied hospitals .
the givers will be generous because they do n't have to worry about the consequences .
( laughter ) now for those of you who are highly agreeable , or maybe slightly canadian , you get this right away .
( laughter ) that 's not a joke , that 's actually an empirical fact . ( laughter )
this is the person who 's nice to your face , and then will stab you right in the back .
i 'm an organic food-eating , carbon footprint-minimizing , robotic surgery geek .
screw the paper towels . let 's go to a sponge .
now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house .
now , the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it ; this is the energy it takes to make it — millions and millions of paper towels .
so first , we demolish it .
we also used straw bale infill for our library , which has zero embodied energy .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
and so the question is : how could we make that back ?
davinia was born in jamaica , emigrated to the us at the age of 18 , and now lives just outside of washington , dc .
now , some people 's immediate reaction to this idea is that it 's either a bit utopian or even threatening .
still terrible .
sure , they did n't create smoky mountain , but they may as well have .
we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues .
but how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens ?
activism is the currency .
how will that achieve anything ?
they got together and committed 665 million dollars .
these dreams are within reach .
thanks to him and so many others , i came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people — the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world , the global citizens .
`` global citizens who stand together , who ask the question `` '' why ? , '' '' who reject the naysayers , and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share . ''
we can use it for drinking and agriculture .
and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
we seem to be spending more and more money .
guess what . they do n't .
they do n't like that environment because it 's nothing like what they have in the body .
what about animal testing ?
we need to design , build and engineer a home away from home for the cells .
it 's beautiful , is n't it ? but it 's pretty incredible .
it can do a tremendous amount of things .
we 're not trying to do that here .
in the center , we have a porous , flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from , say , our lungs , and then underneath , they had capillary cells , the cells in our blood vessels .
we could , for example , mimic infection , where we add bacterial cells into the lung .
white blood cells are our body 's defense against bacterial invaders , and when they sense this inflammation due to infection , they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria .
it 's pretty exciting .
now i want to share this picture with you , not just because it 's so beautiful , but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips .
it tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs , actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung .
there 's fluid flowing across these cells , so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip .
we could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure .
we have engineers , we have cell biologists , we have clinicians , all working together .
and this is key to the potential of that technology .
now let me show you our instrument .
so a cell biologist like me can come in , take a chip , put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there , put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c.d. , and away you go .
now , let 's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if i could take your stem cells and put them on a chip , or your stem cells and put them on a chip .
and , in addition , the israeli doctrine of the periphery , the idea that israel 's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non-arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the arab states in its vicinity .
the iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in tehran , far away from the central terminal , so that no one would notice the large number of israeli planes shuttling between tel aviv and tehran .
in spite of the very clear anti-israeli ideology of the new regime , the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common threats .
the soviet union collapsed , iraq was defeated , and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure , but they were also now left unchecked .
and on his left , my sisters : mary catherine , judith ann , theresa marie .
i loved growing up in a big family .
but it took me by surprise to learn in an area of ethiopia , parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more .
and this loss might be a little more bearable without a name .
now , do n't misunderstand me — i 'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like herceptin to the developing world , although i 'd actually kind of like that .
all my patients died .
so instead , we target those areas where hiv rates are the highest .
so ...
we can do that because we know .
once we define the problem , we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin .
so , you know , i live in two different worlds , one world populated by scientists , and another world populated by public health professionals .
( applause )
how wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ?
the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
she was rushed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
`` i wonder how many of you , looking at that , said to yourselves just now , `` '' i would not have done that . ''
and i believe you . i 'm sure you 're right .
does it really matter that they 're far away ?
you felt the empathy for that child .
so toby founded an organization called giving what we can to spread this information , to unite people who want to share some of their income , and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty .
so let 's talk about effectiveness .
well , right , it is a good thing to do , but you have to think what else you could do with the resources .
it costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma .
givewell exists to really assess the impact of charities , not just whether they 're well-run , and it 's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three , of which the against malaria foundation is number one .
i 'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
and some effective altruists think it 's very important to make sure that our species survives at all .
here 's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently , when an asteroid passed close to our planet .
i 've enjoyed giving all of my life since i was a graduate student .
i 'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that i received while i was writing this talk just a month or so ago .
why was he recovering from surgery ?
`` the email began , `` '' last tuesday , i anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger . ''
i was pleased to read it . chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did .
so if you 're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well , there 's a way for you to get off the hook .
( applause )
`` i want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film , `` '' children of the taliban . '' '' ( singing ) the taliban now run their own schools . ''
young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .
ha : if god gives me strength .
that 's why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
this boy is called sadik .
before i go any further , let me clarify my role in all of this .
even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries , not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them .
now , do n't get me wrong , dictionaries are fantastic resources , but they are human and they are not timeless .
they have to gamble , because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it , such as lol , but they do n't want to appear faddish and include the words that are n't going to make it , and i think a word that they 're watching right now is yolo , you only live once .
the most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand .
`` past winners in this category have included `` recombobulation area , '' which is at the milwaukee airport after security , where you can recombobulate . ''
`` ( laughter ) but some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable , such as `` '' app '' '' and `` '' e '' '' as a prefix , and `` '' google '' '' as a verb . ''
we 're noticing words that are coming into prominence .
it 's really a question of attitude .
`` think about the word `` '' peruse '' '' and how you use that word . ''
i do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the english language .
`` there are going to be changes where you think , `` '' really ? ''
it 's not . it is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it .
so how does a word get into a dictionary ?
the music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
we managed , but sometimes those halls did n't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
( laughter ) and well , that was an opera experience .
and the size of the room is not that big .
around the same , according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet — no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
[ live music ] does n't really change that much .
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
( laughter ) and in some ways it 's like carnegie hall , or when the audience had to hush up , because you can now hear every single detail .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
and like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder , and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical .
and so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble , and we make a decision .
`` `` can the brain build such a perception ? '' ''
so you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano , a million-key grand piano .
you may be born lucky , where you know how to master your neocortical column , and you can play a fantastic symphony .
`` in fact , there is a new theory of autism called the `` '' intense world '' '' theory , which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns . ''
they are highly reactive , and they are super-plastic , and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .
but you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns , the note is going to be off .
the perception , the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted , and you will have symptoms of disease .
so , the holy grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column — and it 's not just for neuroscience ; it 's perhaps to understand perception , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
and a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other .
and , in fact , the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two cambridge nobel laureates .
we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other .
we can load up all the neurons , each one on to its processor , and fire it up , and see what happens .
and then when we zoomed into this , it 's like a veritable universe .
i do n't know anything else about him , except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger .
but first let me tell you what happened .
these questions are really important to understanding basic aspects of human social nature .
a lot of people , and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish , that we 're only ever really motivated by our own welfare .
the actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent definition of altruism , which is a voluntary , costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual .
the part of the brain that 's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala .
and i think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person .
the psychologist steven pinker and others have shown that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening circles of others , which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence , from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment .
maybe .
as societies become wealthier and better off , people seem to turn their focus of attention outward , and as a result , all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases , from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations .
but what 's clear is the kinds of changes we 're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence , maybe even more so , and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others , i really believe that the ability to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone .
it 's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .
did it answer the question ?
yet , that 's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice .
math is a much broader subject than calculating .
we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers .
it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do .
for example : mental arithmetic .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
a hundred years ago , it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
it can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that .
so there 's another thing that comes up with basics .
so just because paper was invented before computers , it does n't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .
see , normally in school , you do things like solve quadratic equations .
same principles applied — calculations , harder .
i do n't think so — quite the opposite .
programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days , and it 's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand .
if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it .
now i 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams , but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people 's real understanding .
we 're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math .
calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years .
now i 'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future .
the given terms and conditions shape our perception , our actions and our lives .
and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation .
the academy of arts joined the project , and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop , exactly between the listening posts of the nsa and the gchq .
`` # expect us . we will # shutdown '' '' `` this is the nsa 's achilles heel . open networks . '' ''
`` `` agents , what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren ? '' ''
if we become aware of the constellation , the terms and conditions of communication , it not only broadens our horizon , it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview , our specific social , political or aesthetic conventions .
let 's look at an actual example .
we were searching for an interface and we found one .
on the face of it , it was a very simple installation .
the situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses .
it is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion .
it 's the idea of computation .
then , i started drilling down , thinking about the computations i might want to do , trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible .
but i wanted to look not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe .
i mean , we 're used to having science let us predict things , but something like this is fundamentally irreducible .
the only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve .
things with rules as simple as these can do it .
but i 'd always assumed that to make progress , i 'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain .
and it should be able to tell us that .
or let 's try asking about , i do n't know , the international space station .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
so far , there are about 8 million lines of mathematica code in wolfram alpha built by experts from many , many different fields .
you can expect to see wolfram alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on .
you know , i 've realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one 's starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .
so , with physical materials , we 're used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes .
i 'm hoping we can , for example , use that even to get wolfram alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly , and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it 's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
and each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe .
stephen wolfram : well , the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true , things like the standard model of physics : what i 'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it 's simply wrong .
i think things like the rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level .
one of the things i should probably tell you is , i worked for the discovery channel early in my career , and that sort of warped my framework .
other than the fact that they ca n't tell directions , and they have very strange breeding habits , how do you actually work with these things ? ( laughter ) what we need to understand is : what drives the political creature ?
it does n't matter , it 's spam .
how about you get on the phone ?
and the answer is rather strange .
it 's a letter .
so , how are you going to write your letter ?
first of all , you send the original to the district office .
so , what your letter means : i 've got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
this is an opportunity at real dialogue , and if you have stewardship and want to communicate , that dialogue is incredibly powerful .
i had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life .
then one day i had a fever of 104.7 degrees .
i even saw a psychiatrist .
that day , i ran a small experiment .
in 1934 , 198 doctors , nurses and staff at the los angeles county general hospital became seriously ill .
the problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven .
i soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart .
like the hysteria of old , this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe .
me affects children and me affects millions of men .
my brain is not what it used to be .
online we came together , and we shared our stories .
i still had to make ridiculous choices : will i sit in the garden for 15 minutes , or will i wash my hair today ?
we have filled the void with something wonderful , but it is not enough .
and if we can do that , if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know , and then , rather than fear uncertainty , maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder .
so let me start with this .
what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens .
so now what i can do is , rather than getting the instructions for the device online , i can simply point at it , the device is recognized , and then — voice : begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable .
( laughter ) mm : awesome . thank you .
teacher : see what happens . ( children talking ) keep going .
it 's available for everyone to do , and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now .
tamara , are you recording ?
okay , so are you all ready ?
audience : whooooooo !
a german prison camp .
and he 's operating in a hostile environment .
he 'd already smuggled vitamin c into the camp , and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market .
and after just a few days , it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness , marmite is the cure .
now i 'm not telling you this story because i think archie cochrane is a dude , although archie cochrane is a dude .
i 'm telling you this story because archie cochrane , all his life , fought against a terrible affliction , and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies .
i see it in the politicians we vote for — people who , in the face of an incredibly complicated world , are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works .
you know hans : the mick jagger of ted .
he 's at mit .
and i think it 'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow .
and what we learned is cesar 's work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
and i 'm just counting toasters here .
the complexity here is unbelievable .
and it 's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error .
you could use it in an industrial context .
you try out 10 variations on that one .
and the moment you step back from the god complex — let 's just try to have a bunch of stuff ; let 's have a systematic way of determining what 's working and what 's not — you can solve your problem .
the u.s. economy is still the world 's greatest economy .
and eventually , they 'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets — ( laughter ) if , of course , they have n't already done so .
i sometimes wonder .
it did n't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
obviously trial and error is very important .
you think it 's obvious ?
`` we 'll get rid of the ones that do n't . '' '' — when a politician campaigns on that platform , and more importantly , when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician , then i will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works , and that — thank you . ''
it is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home .
it is n't easy .
six years ago , i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict .
and if you 're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict settings , then you must talk about women , because they are the population you have left .
how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women 's economic potential ?
it is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women , to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world .
i felt like a pilot flying through the mist , and i lost all sense of direction .
that 's why your schemas had better match reality .
if a is the question , b is the answer , stay creative in the cloud , and you start going , and experiments do n't work , experiments do n't work , experiments do n't work , experiments do n't work , until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense , like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet .
now you can be lost in the cloud for a day , a week , a month , a year , a whole career , but sometimes , if you 're lucky enough and you have enough support , you can see in the materials at hand , or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud , a new answer , c , and you decide to go for it .
so knowing about the cloud , you also learn from improvisation theater a very effective way to have conversations inside the cloud .
`` `` here is a pool of water . '' `` yeah , let 's jump in . '' ''
so there was no way to talk about it in conferences .
`` it 's not by chance . it 's a matter of values . '' '' you see , science seeks knowledge that 's objective and rational . ''
and when i heard that , that science has a culture , everything clicked into place for me , because if science has a culture , culture can be changed , and i can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever i could .
and so the very next lecture i gave in a conference , i talked about my science , and then i talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them , and i looked at the audience , and they were cold .
they could n't hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
i was in the cloud .
thank you for your backup singing .
`` hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . '' '' and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , `` when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? '' ''
and , in a way , it was buckminster fuller who coined that phrase .
but again , that only shows part of the picture .
so the problems of sustainability can not be separated from the nature of the cities , of which the buildings are a part .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology — which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i cite our own experience as a company , and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects — then how do you measure that change of technology ?
in other words , for this community , they have this garden in the sky .
and nature is part of the generator , the driver for this building .
and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time .
`` so we humored him , we kept him happy . '' '' the image at the top , what it does n't — if you look at it in detail , really what it is saying is you can wire this building . ''
and what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology .
again , coming back to that thing about the lifestyle , and in a way , the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit .
if i show another aspect of that technology then , in a completely different context — this apartment building in the alps in switzerland .
and on the left are the cutting machines , which then , in the factory , enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very , very few millimeters , to be slotted together on site .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we — what happened before that ?
i mean , you know , what was life like before the mobile phone , the things that you take for granted ?
and at that particular point in time , this was one of the few solitary computers .
now , every week , we have the equivalent of 84 million disks , which record our archival information on past , current and future projects .
the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views , which give light , ventilation , make the building fresher .
so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will redress that , and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
now what form do they take ?
how do you make them more friendly at that scale ?
larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at heathrow — built — plus the new , un-built terminal five .
and the challenge here is a building that will be green , that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel , is about friendly , is coming back to that starting point , is very , very much about the lifestyle .
and perhaps these , in the end , as celebratory spaces .
and that 's a concerted platform .
'theme and variations ' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
and that was enormously liberating to me .
and now , four large panels : this is upper left ; upper right ; lower left ; lower right .
`` on another subject — ( laughter ) — i was driving in the country one day with my wife , and i saw this sign , and i said , `` '' that is a fabulous piece of design . '' '' and she said , `` '' what are you talking about ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , it 's so persuasive , because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage , and since most people are so suspicious of garages , and know that they 're going to be ripped off , they use the word 'reliable . ' but everybody says they 're reliable . ''
`` because as soon as you hear the word dutchman — which is an archaic word , nobody calls dutch people `` '' dutchmen '' '' anymore — but as soon as you hear dutchman , you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike , preventing the thing from falling and flooding holland , and so on . ''
and here , a very peculiar poster because , simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer , it wo n't sit still in the space .
but , we do n't have time .
there were 10 artists invited to participate in it , and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i did n't want to be embarrassed , so i worked very hard on this .
clearly we do n't have 10 planets .
north americans , such as myself , you know , we 're basically sort of wallowing , gluttonous hogs , and we 're eating all sorts of stuff .
they 've been exposed to this idea of our society , of our prosperity .
everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios .
and given that i have 13 minutes to do this , this is going to go kind of quick .
if we can change the dynamic , by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
they 've bounded the city with a line .
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other , one of the things you can do is — as information technologies develop — you can start to have smart places .
so , here 's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use , which i think is a pretty cool concept , although i think it ought to work the other way around , that it gets brighter the more you do n't use .
there 's a lot of this stuff happening ; it 's really pretty remarkable .
there 's also neo-biological design , where more and more we 're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry .
so what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just permeating out through society .
`` like , i do n't know if any of you have seen the movie `` '' city of god ? '' '' yeah , it 's a fabulous movie if you have n't seen it . ''
so lula , he 's full of problems , full of contradictions , but one of the things that he 's doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
`` this is from `` '' a force more powerful . '' '' it 's a little screenshot . ''
some of those designs include models for acting , such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps .
`` i think that , in fact , that `` '' all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning . ''
how do you explain when things do n't go as we assume ?
or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?
i call it the golden circle .
it just does n't drive behavior .
the goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it 's to hire people who believe what you believe .
most people do n't know about samuel pierpont langley .
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for langley .
he was in pursuit of the result .
he was in pursuit of the riches .
the next 13.5 % of our population are our early adopters .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us .
my father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in ukraine .
inside , it 's a smelly , gaping hole in the ground , but outside , it 's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun .
but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects .
take away land speculation , price of land drops .
scarce labor drives wages .
but i think we 're in for another change , about two generations after the top of that curve , once the effects of a declining population start to settle in .
at that point , we 'll start romanticizing the future again , instead of the nasty , brutish past .
because transitions are dangerous times .
when land owners start to lose money , and labor demands more pay , there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future .
( applause )
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they 've done all the work , and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us , particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner : hockey sticks .
this is explicitly showing you how things scale , and this is a truly remarkable graph .
and here 's the point of that .
so a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
the question is : is any of this true for cities and companies ?
do n't know . we will discuss that .
the slope of that is less than linear .
less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are — not surprising .
and what you see is a scaling phenomenon .
here it is , which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita , unlike biology — higher wages , more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger , more patents per capita , more crime per capita .
on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities , showing that increase .
we have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
it 's the same plot .
if it has this sublinear scaling , the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth .
but you notice , i 've cheated , because i 've only gone up to '94 .
let 's go up to 2008 .
so if i 'd have done this in 1994 , i could have predicted what walmart would be now .
actually , exactly the opposite is what i 'm going to do .
this is the pudong area .
you can not be constrained by the public 's opinion .
here 's the key question .
this is a key issue .
has a systematic advantage over country 2 in infrastructures .
they must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
but for many years , until the late 1990s , china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis india .
and this is clearly the story of the chinese economic growth .
by 2008 , country a has surpassed country b with $ 700 per capita gdp as compared with $ 650 per capita gdp .
`` and which one is a democracy ? '' '' you may argue , `` '' well , maybe country a is china and country b is india . '' '' in fact , country a is democratic india , and country b is pakistan — the country that has a long period of military rule . ''
one reason is the east asian model .
burma did n't succeed .
if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide , there 's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth .
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
the advantage the country had was human capital — nothing else but human capital .
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
the adult literacy rate in china is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in india .
china held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis india .
on average , as a chinese in 1965 , you lived 10 years more than an average indian .
it depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system .
in fact , when india was growing at a hindu rate of growth — about one percent , two percent a year — that was when india was least democratic .
one reason is they are always comparing india with china .
but i believe that india has the momentum .
okay . now how many people know what this is ?
what does this mean ?
so i was thinking , how do we apply this to this book ?
and my ideas are — in my head , anyway — they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on and problem solving for clients .
i do n't want you to see what i 'm doing up here .
we even made flooring , walls and everything , out of cardboard .
and it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice .
and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff .
and after i got — i was really drunk — i was asked to do some sketches on napkins .
and oldenburg , who i work with a little once in a while , told me i could n't do it , and so that made it even more exciting .
it was pretty hard .
could n't find it .
so ...
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one .
and , finally , jay dragged me to my hometown , toronto , canada .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife , which i get credit for participating in .
and that chain link is really expensive .
and then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
but we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other .
and it 's just a complex of factory buildings .
because these were ideas that we were talking about , building things next to each other , making — it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city , maybe .
i flew in one night and took this picture .
these are the models .
we used it at loyola on the chapel , and it did n't work .
it 's never been finished .
and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum , and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
she did n't care where .
and it 's very private .
this is the bedroom .
and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table .
but the idea is , the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside .
we 're doing some work for him .
the restaurants here — the apartments and the theater , etc .
`` and i keep thinking , `` '' this is going to be the last fish . '' '' it 's like a drug addict . ''
i think i 'm from mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and i think , productively .
it 's a complicated project .
it has a chamber hall .
there 's commercial at the ground floor .
but finally , there 's a hotel there .
but you get the sense of the hall in section .
and i was asked to do a fish , and so i did a snake .
`` and most importantly , true love will find you when you least expect it . '' '' now as it turns out , i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about data , as you 'll soon find . ''
so i decided to sign on .
and we went in , and right off the bat , our conversation really was n't taking flight , but he was ordering a lot of food .
well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
but i did n't want everybody 's data .
i was the most popular person online .
it looks like you did come up with a really , really great system .
it 's peer respect that drives us .
and he made this statement that was so profound to me .
and so that 's what i proceeded to do , through a long story , one of desperation , so if i do it , rather than talk about it , if i do it , you 'll be the first to know .
`` and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , `` '' that 's impossible ! you ca n't explain consciousness . '' '' the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question . ''
`` but with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , `` '' i am an expert . ''
there 's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along , you learn a lot about this man .
`` they think , `` '' no , there ca n't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness . '' '' this is a lovely book by a friend of mine named lee siegel , who 's a professor of religion , actually , at the university of hawaii , and he 's an expert magician , and an expert on the street magic of india , which is what this book is about , `` net of magic . '' ''
do n't take the thrill of it away . i 'd rather be mystified .
but i 'm going to try to also show you that consciousness is n't quite as marvelous — your own consciousness is n't quite as wonderful — as you may have thought it is .
he did n't even try to do those things .
and the same is true of consciousness .
watch it carefully .
and where your eye is n't looking , you 're remarkably impoverished in your vision .
now , what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?
you think the detail 's there , but it is n't there .
let 's just do this experiment very quickly .
can you see it ?
your brain is actually computing that boundary , the boundary that goes right there .
the purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who 's going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? no .
when i first started talking about the bradley , petrie , dumais example that you just saw — i 'll go back to it , this one — i said that there was no filling-in behind there .
`` [ `` '' failure to detect changes in scenes '' '' slide ] this is ron rensink 's work , which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book . ''
2.9 seconds .
how many still do n't see it ? how many still do n't see it ?
how many engines on the wing of that boeing ?
and we 're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
jeff hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
if you work on one neuron , that 's neuroscience .
it was a little bit too funky , and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way — fashion .
my studio in bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest , and monkeys , of course , are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .
so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the sayan valley in indonesia .
he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant , the unconscious .
and if paula decides should she marry joe or jack , somehow paul sounds the most interesting .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
this is a project we 're working on right now with a very healthy deadline .
but i did n't quite know all that much about movement or film .
and i 've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way .
in my childhood , i played around in my father 's university lab .
in south africa , the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority .
finally , even for those who do manage to get the higher education , the doors of opportunity might not open .
andrew teaches one of the bigger stanford classes .
( video ) robert ghrist : welcome to calculus .
scott page : models help us design more effective institutions and policies .
dan jurafsky : does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose ? well , that sounds funny .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries .
but it 's not just about the numbers , it 's also about the people .
baby shannon — you can see her on the left — is doing much better now , and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it .
( laughter ) so they get to try again , and this time they got it right .
there 's an optional explanation if they want .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
this is a kind of simple question that i as an instructor might ask in class , but when i ask that kind of a question in class , 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing i said , 15 percent are zoned out on facebook , and then there 's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it , and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer .
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story .
there are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework .
well , mark twain certainly thought so .
at the break , i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate .
it 's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism , that of haemophilus influenzae .
we 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation .
( laughter ) we filter through some simple apparatuses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city .
and these vary tremendously from region to region .
so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes , components and life on this planet .
and if you take all animals together , we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families .
and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled 24 hours later .
so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential , not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues .
civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good , using technology to solve humanitarian problems .
eventually , these innovations will get out and find everyone .
a final example from across the world in east africa : there 's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights , for a number of reasons .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
now we know today — this was revealed by thomas reed , ronald reagan 's former u.s. air force secretary — this explosion was actually the result of a cia sabotage operation , in which they had managed to infiltrate the it management systems of that pipeline .
more recently , the u.s. government revealed that in september 2008 , more than 3 million people in the state of espirito santo in brazil were plunged into darkness , victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates .
however , if we 'd had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies , which give the advantage to the attacker , make the blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in europe .
okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
but nato , though it defends estonia , reacted very prudently . why ?
because nato could n't be 100 % sure that the kremlin was indeed behind these attacks .
and this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons .
the information technologies joël de rosnay was talking about , which were historically born from military research , are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction , which could tomorrow , if we 're not careful , completely destroy world peace .
thank you .
these many things that enable our daily lives rely either directly or indirectly on satellites .
the goal , of course , is to persuade climbers to clean up after themselves , so maybe local not-for-profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste , or expeditions might organize voluntary cleanup trips .
there 's no simple or easy answer , and even well-intentioned efforts at conservation often run into problems .
but we simply can not reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump , one that 's out of this world .
the reality of space is that if a component on a satellite breaks down , there really are limited opportunities for repairs , and only at great cost .
what if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end-of-life disposal of satellites instead of moving them out of the way as a temporary solution ?
there are some encouraging signs .
robotic repair and maintenance could extend the lives of hundreds of satellites orbiting around the earth .
simply put , we have n't found a way to use space sustainably yet .
there is without doubt congestion in the low earth and geostationary orbits , and we can not keep launching new satellites to replace the ones that have broken down without doing something about them first , just like we would never leave a broken down car in the middle of the highway .
in fact , i want them to become beautiful .
( laughter ) so bear with me as i am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a beautiful organization .
some called it a pr stunt , others — a genuine act of giving back .
they create something out of nothing because they 're completely unnecessary .
and the new brand color was going to be orange .
and what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions ?
in other words , intimacy .
not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve , it also broke down invisible barriers and created a lasting bond amongst themselves .
so this is how you create intimacy .
it does n't mean that you ca n't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical , but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth .
and the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room — a biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy .
but we 've all been ugly once .
the center for political beauty , an activist collective in berlin , recently staged an extreme artistic intervention .
every night they set up a small , temporary village to deliberate their own vision of the french republic .
beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles and design for them .
you know , it 's a spatula , it 's a pry bar , it 's a screwdriver and it 's a blade , yeah .
although for two years , we were like prisoners at home .
the old islamic city in syria was built over a multilayered past , integrating with it and embracing its spirit .
while many reasons had led to the syrian war , we should n't underestimate the way in which , by contributing to the loss of identity and self-respect , urban zoning and misguided , inhumane architecture have nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred .
from my point of view , the main focus should be on creating places that make their people feel they belong .
almost two years ago , i introduced this design into a un-habitat competition for rebuilding it .
the fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls .
the odd one out is an astronomer , and i am one of that strange breed .
if we go beyond our solar system , we 've learned that the stars are n't twinkly points of light .
in six billion years , the sun will look like that .
we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled .
and we 'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe .
we know our universes are united though — links between left and right .
the everyday world is determined by atoms , how they stick together to make molecules .
and , as we 've learned in the last few years , galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter : particles in huge swarms , far smaller even than atomic nuclei .
so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours , but we 're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension , and we 're imprisoned in our three .
there 's one challenge symbolized at the top , but there 's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom .
and the most complex things are ourselves , midway between atoms and stars .
we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of .
we clearly have to be large , compared to atoms , to have layer upon layer of complex structure .
`` and i now move on to the second part of my talk , and the book `` '' our final century '' '' was mentioned . ''
it may change this century .
but they will have a dark side .
equally untidy office there , as you can see .
and he sets an example of the concerned scientist .
there 's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun 's demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
apart from those brief traumas , nothing happens suddenly .
the continental landmasses drifted around .
change has accelerated as human populations rose .
the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves — the total output from all tv and cell phones and radar transmissions . and something else happened .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
so we built something .
this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about 20 miles per hour , about 30 kilometers an hour , and this battery , this battery right here has about six miles of range , or 10 kilometers , which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u.s. alone .
it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do .
over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
it was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
so babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do .
matthew hurley is the first author of this . we call it the hurley model .
thank you very much .
but in this case we cracked it , but a big part of the problem still remains .
here 's an example from a variety of contexts .
adherence rates . how many people are taking their insulin every day ?
we think there 's an income problem , so we create new ways of farming that increase income .
the last mile is , everywhere , problematic .
`` should you increase , maintain or decrease the number of fluids ? '' '' just so you do n't embarrass yourselves , i 'll give you the right answer : it 's increase . ''
`` well , one possibility — i think that 's how most people respond to this — is to say , `` '' that 's just stupid . '' '' i do n't think that 's stupid . ''
so , think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .
it just does n't happen to be right about the world .
`` convincing people to do something — take oral rehydration therapy , intercrop , whatever it might be — is not an act of information : `` '' let 's give them the data , and when they have data they 'll do the right thing . '' '' it 's more complex than that . ''
a bat and a ball together cost $ 1.10 .
the bat costs a dollar more than the ball .
yeah . so , together they would cost $ 1.20 .
there 's a great show on american television that you have to watch .
yellow . blue . red .
( laughter ) sendhil mullainathan : that 's pretty good .
these models , like the leaky bucket , work well in most situations .
diarrhea , and many last mile problems , are like that .
`` you read `` '' blue '' '' and you wanted to say `` '' blue , '' '' even though you knew your task was red . ''
now , i do this stuff because it 's fun .
i 'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion .
so now , while you 're thinking about that let 's move to a second task .
see , you have a mental model .
fifty versus 35 , that 's a big move . eleven versus nine ? come on .
here was bmw 's brilliant insight , which they embodied into an ad campaign .
the car swerves to avoid it , and therefore does n't get into an accident .
it harnesses something you already believe .
this is a battle we all fight every day , along with trying to get to the gym .
so , let me now talk about the last mile problem .
and i think maybe i 'm being too negative .
`` now , you may think to yourself , `` '' well , if my eyes depended on it , you know , i would obviously use it every day . '' '' but the pain , the discomfort , you know , paying attention , remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip : these are the day-to-day of life , and they do pose problems . ''
the needle is particularly sharp .
you see , we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem .
but the human innovation , the human problem still remains , and that 's a great frontier that we have left .
and you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets , reduced electricity , 900 million dollars per year .
see what 's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile , to me , is that the first 999 miles are all about science .
sendhil mullainathan : yeah , we spend a lot of time talking to marketers , and i think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say , there are insights to be gleaned there .
right . so what has changed ?
( laughter ) that 's why the mascot of internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee .
( laughter ) it 's very complicated , but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly . ( laughter )
it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet .
so , for example , last year , the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .
then , at moment number two , you have the fake announcement go out .
now just think about that .
i have a theory i can explain later .
`` it 's reminiscent of the description of history as `` '' one damn thing after another , '' '' right ? ''
it does make you wonder if there were , for instance , a massive , extremely popular star trek convention one weekend , who would be minding the store ?
every article on wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page , and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article .
i mean , this is a 2005 business week cover .
they start off on all sorts of goofy projects .
where we decide how we want to treat it .
and we now have means that we can build , like this system , so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .
an nyu researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them , and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination .
( laughter ) no . i think the actual answer is that once you reframe it , once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day , but now , for whatever reason , is tarnished , you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on craigslist represents .
it 's a brilliant idea .
( laughter ) so , my urging , my thought , is that the internet is n't just a pile of information .
and when you go on it , if you listen and see carefully and closely enough , what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you .
so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline .
it maxes out in the 1930s , '40s and '50s , and then it starts slowing down , and here 's a cautionary note .
the first headwind is demographics .
it 's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity , rises faster than output per hour , if hours per person increased .
now hours per person are shrinking , first because of the retirement of the baby boomers , and second because there 's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution .
in college , we 've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care .
and then we have inequality .
and then we had the electric washing machine .
what about the internal combustion engine , which was invented in 1879 ?
of course , when the motor vehicle was invented , and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929 , that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export .
but by 1929 , cities around the country had put in underground water pipes .
what about the electronic revolution ?
here 's an early computer .
fast forward through the '90s , we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth .
but imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are , but we knew so little about and treated with such disregard .
well , it turns out that we do have something just like that : our gut , or rather , its microbes .
we have n't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it 's just a matter of time before we find out . ( laughter ) so microbes are performing a huge range of functions .
different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another .
with microbiology , it 's kind of the same , although i 've got to be honest with you : all the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope .
so when we take them together , they look like this .
what my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data and turn them into something that 's a bit more useful as a map , and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from 250 healthy volunteers , it looks like this .
over on the other side , we have the skin community in blue , the vaginal community in purple , and then right down at the bottom , we have the fecal community in brown .
so that 's as different as the bacteria on this prairie and the bacteria in this forest .
and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth , such as more asthma , more allergies , even more obesity , all of which have been linked to microbes now , and when you think about it , until recently , every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal , and so the lack of those protective microbes that we 've co-evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome .
what i 'm showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
and you 've seen children develop physically .
this is up to about two years .
but something amazing is about to happen here .
so he 's getting antibiotics for an ear infection .
well , fascinatingly , it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life , they 're more likely to become obese later on than if they do n't get antibiotics then or only get them later , and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we 're only beginning to understand .
so that 's amazing , right ?
but how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect ?
the implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior .
we 're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases , ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity , and perhaps even autism and depression .

and when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura , and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she 's going to be ?
curitiba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area , 1,800,000 people in the city itself .
but to make it happen , sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design — an idea that everyone , or the large majority , will help you to make it happen .
which is bogota , and they did a very good job .
our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems .
and 23 years after , they called us to develop — we 're developing this idea .
i would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what 's said , but do n't forget the cities and the children .
we do n't rip our family portrait , even if we do n't like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you .
and since we have people from uzbekistan , kazakhstan , tajikistan , [ unclear ] , we have to stop the program .
and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin .
when we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side-by-side , eventually we get to the point in the process that 's fuzzy or unconventional .
so i 've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have .
but at one point he had a moment of crisis .
he turned it into an adventure for the kids .
but doug 's results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
a few years ago i felt a lump on the side of my neck , and it was my turn in the mri machine .
so i know at ted you 're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing .
so i hope you 'll join me on my quest — you as thought leaders .
that is the word that comes to mind .
we 're the new technologists .
we have a lot of data , so we have a lot of power .
but it brings me back .
so we can make money ?
uh huh .
android .
you 'd think with a bunch of smart people we would n't be such suckers just for the pretty phones .
not as many votes .
terrifying , because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions .
we know more about mobile operating systems , but what we really need is a moral operating system .
you feel good when you do something right , you feel bad when you do something wrong .
and from day to day , we have the techniques that we use .
and maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
there are truths about two .
he wants objective truths .
but here 's the way it works .
and compared to the little pain that it 's going to cause — because it 's going to be embarrassing when i 'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit — that 's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
it 's based on norse legend .
`` it 's gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry . '' '' that 's interesting . ''
we figure out what will happen with this technology .
you sir , that 's three .
anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
good , how about the person behind her ?
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins , gets lift , powers its movements with a lunate tail .
these fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months .
most of us from the ship — even i — look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea .
it 's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it .
i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium .
here , for over 14 or 15 years , we 've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity .
now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
we put water over its gills , give it oxygen .
and that 's the fisheries off the state of north carolina .
the warm is the gulf stream , the cold up there in the gulf of maine .
these become forthright in places we need to protect .
but in the international realm , where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild , these are the places that we have to make hope spots in .
and , funded primarily through sloan foundation and others , we were able to actually go in , in our project — we 're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators , not just tunas .
that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .
and we 'll wind in the target .
`` and we 'll place an acoustic tag that says , `` '' omshark 10165 , '' '' or something like that , acoustically with a ping . ''
for the first time , an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale , showing where the sharks go .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles .
and when we do and it swims , we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .
make killer apps , if you will .
we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans .
( applause )
in kyrgyzstan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks .
so are these now the images of the past ?
well , notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the middle east , darfur , iraq , elsewhere , there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .
the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80,000 soldiers , policemen and rebels killed every year .
this is a decrease by two-thirds .
but then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months .
thus , even though every civilian killed , maimed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
the ending of liberia 's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership , diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full-scale civil war in macedonia in 2001 , or the successful ending of the conflict in aceh in indonesia in 2005 .
the hopes that were vested in the oslo accords did not lead to an end of the israeli/palestinian conflict .
a cold war is not as good as a cold peace , but a cold peace is still better than a hot war .
third , institutional design .
institutional design requires a keen focus on issues , innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation .
therefore , we must invest in developing leaders , leaders that have the skills , vision and determination to make peace .
and i was there to honor a great 20th century explorer , roy chapman andrews .
is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth ?
so beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease .
in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them .
and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza .
and if we started looking into that genetic information , we 'd see a number of usual suspects out there — of course , a lot of human genetic information , but also bacterial and viral information , mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose .
there are unknowns all around us and they 're just waiting to be discovered .
and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .
`` and i said , `` '' yes , i would love to do that . it sounds great . '' '' and i left the room and said , `` '' no way . '' '' the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky , and there was no way i was going to have anything to do with those people . ''
i decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life .
`` ( singing ) i love the little smile she does right over the top of the note — like , `` '' no problem , everything 's fine . '' '' ( laughter ) and from the crowd emerged this young man , scott haines . ''
and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .
and the video went viral .
( singing ) and some younger members .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
it is a dream come true to be part of this choir , as i 've never been part of one .
`` as i am in the great alaskan bush , satellite is my connection to the world . '' '' so two things struck me deeply about this . ''
the first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other .
it does n't matter the technology .
you 're the very first people to see this .
so here we have this incredible field , which has enormous hope for humanity , but much like ivf over 35 years ago , until the birth of a healthy baby , louise , this field has been under siege politically and financially .
and that 's what i want to focus on .
we 've spent the last couple of years pondering this , making a list of the different things that we had to do , and so we developed a new technology , it 's software and hardware , that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array , essentially avatars of ourselves .
and as he watched the disease unfold , he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought . there was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons , and you simply could n't see it until you had the human model .
so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box , or a flight recorder .
you ca n't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers .
you know , we 're not mice , and you ca n't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for , you know , a promising drug .
so that is terrific , and we thought , all right , as we 're trying to solve this problem , clearly we have to think about genetics , we have to think about human testing , but there 's a fundamental problem , because right now , stem cell lines , as extraordinary as they are , and lines are just groups of cells , they are made by hand , one at a time , and it takes a couple of months .
we needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data , and the way to do that was to find a stand-in , a biological stand-in , that could contain all of the genetic information , but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar .
we need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types that represent who we are .
by the way , it happens about once every century .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it 's happening now .
we have seen lateral shifts of power — the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations — but we are seeing something slightly different .
for power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .
and i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim : to bring governance to the global space .
and that 's a big problem , and we 'll return to it in just a second .
i think actually this is not so much a shift from the west to the east ; something different is happening .
note , that when we went into libya , it was not good enough for the west to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
let me make a prediction for you , which is probably even more startling .
they want to keep the sea lanes open .
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
we are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations .
and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a viable proposition .
you understand that in industry ; governments do n't .
the great poem of john donne 's .
so , what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning .
so , we 've built this idea of a commons .
girls cooked ; boys did n't , or so was the message that hasbro was sending .
( applause ) thank you .
so it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because i thought , people do n't care , people think it 's a waste of time , and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family .
haters gon na hate .
so this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena , and it 's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony , like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest , or how many are going out to forage .
in the desert , operating costs are high because water is scarce , and the seed-eating ants that i study in the desert have to spend water to get water .
first of all , there 's variation .
on dry days , some colonies forage less , so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds .
and what we 're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it 's willing to go out and forage , because a colony like that would forage less .
each symbol is a colony , and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had , because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies , that is , to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony .
she 's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site .
to my knowledge , this is the first time that we 've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals and find out what 's actually working best .
now , the internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that 's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers .
the anternet is coming .
but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there 's a lot of competition .
in the middle , there 's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species .
different ant species must use different algorithms , because they 've evolved to deal with different resources , and it could be really useful to know about this , and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the international space station .
and i think it 's pretty likely that the invasive species , the ones that come into our buildings , are going to be really good at this , because they 're in your kitchen because they 're really good at finding food and water .
`` that 's bioprocessing , you know ; that 's bio-assisted technology : using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old , old technology called `` '' domestication . '' '' this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it . ''
and i said , that 's what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
this is not for lack of information ; it 's a lack of integration .
now , in a group with so many it people , i do have to mention what i 'm not going to talk about , and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things , on the software side . so there 's computers that protect themselves , like an immune system , and we 're learning from gene regulation and biological development . and we 're learning from neural nets , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computing .
so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
this is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily . look at that shape .
really quick syllabus .
i 'm going to try to go through 12 , really quickly .
now , you 've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology .
a woman named joanna aizenberg , at lucent , is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses . she 's also looking at fiber optics .
we see it that way . plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose , right , out of co2 . he 's found a way — he 's found a catalyst — and he 's found a way to take co2 and make it into polycarbonates . biodegradable plastics out of co2 — how plant-like .
that 's very exciting for fuel cells — to be able to do that without platinum .
we do chemistry in organic solvents .
that 's a mussel you can find in the waters out here , and the threads holding it to a rock are timed ; at exactly two years , they begin to dissolve .
jb : ok , put this — ok , i 'll just hold this thing . ok , great .
sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute .
so thank you , monochrom .
sunni , let 's just remind them .
so we could get three thumbs together , and peter could join us .
but there are advanced configurations .
this is the hardest level . this is the extreme .
everybody , up up up up up !
if you have a free thumb , wave it around , make sure it gets connected .
( laughter ) did you win ? you got it ? you got it ? excellent !
how about surprise ? the actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising .
you guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds , so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other . that is great .
how many people are like me . just admit it .
it just did n't work out for you .
all right . i have very good news for you .
i will just leave you with this tip , if you want to play again .
the best way to become a legendary grandmaster , you 've got your two nodes going on .
focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
that 's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling .
those are important things , but that 's not how i wanted to spend my life .
you 've got the pictures you 've taken .
i thought maybe this was it .
so i spent some time trying to put this together , but was n't having a whole lot of luck , and finally i decided , i 'm going to get through this , i 'm going to come in on a weekend , and i 'm not going to leave until i figure out what this represents .
after 30 hours in the lab , i probably smelled horrible .
so i started looking at the binary information , and i asked myself , what do i do when i first encounter something like this ?
this is what your music looks like , but here 's its visual abstraction .
there was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect .
we 're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles , called cedars-sinai .
and my skull 's crushed and my collar bone is crushed ; all but two of my ribs , my pelvis and both arms — they 're all crushed , but there is still a pulse .
and they get me to that nearby hospital , cedars-sinai , where that night i receive , because of my internal bleeding , 45 units of blood — which means full replacements of all the blood in me — before they 're able to staunch the flow .
and this is how we began .
what you find in the united states is an injury every 20 seconds — that 's one and a half million every year — stroke every 40 seconds , alzheimer 's disease , every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that .
half of e.r . admissions from adolescents are for concussions .
and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars-sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind .
it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning .
this is how i was when i returned from the hospital after nearly four months .
i did n't feel empty ; i felt everything simultaneously .
this is now flash-forward to the point in time where i 've been discharged by the health system .
here 's my brain .
indeed , the mind can redefine itself , and this is demonstrated by two specialists called hagen and silva back in the 1970 's .
but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care .
full-scale i.q . is the mental processing — how fast you can acquire information , retain it and retrieve it — that is essential for success in life today .
and let me show you what happened to the right-hand column when i did my cognitive training over a period of time .
but they felt the evidences that there was important , valuable information in the book , and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it .
here 's somebody , what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and 11 .
bear in mind , there are no nerves in the teeth .
now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes .
and in the following months and years , i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning .
it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free for over 80 years .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i did n't remember my own past .
and as i discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day , i discovered what truly remained .
thank you very much .
you know , when i heard simon 's — please sit down ; i just want to talk to him for a second — when i read his book , i went to la to meet him .
the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to , every treatment he got , every near-miss he had , and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .
and it works . it works .
what does it do ? well actually , i 'll show you down here .
underneath my heel , there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground — what 's called the heel lift .
but this is blinking all the time . it 's sending signals in real time .
because the first generation is exoskeletal , it 's wrapped around the leg , around the affected limb .
the audience is too small .
lp : so when you get a chance , spend some time with simon .
i 'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper , lots of tough challenges .
but even so , we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries .
about 10,000 people died , and nearly all were in the three west african countries .
you can have a virus where people feel well enough while they 're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market .
we have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen .
so far the score is germs : 1 , people : 0 .
these investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic .
thank you .
but here 's the thing : we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system , but that does n't mean that there is no microbial life nearby .
and if we were going to find life on those moons and planets , then we would answer questions such as , are we alone in the solar system ?
and we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is , and today , a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable , but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability , because it involves a distance to a star , but there is another dimension to habitability , and this is a vertical dimension .
and you know , it 's getting worse , because we wo n't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet , and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone .
all record is gone , erased by plate tectonics and erosion .
so is everything lost ? well , maybe not .
this is why mars is so special to us .
so was mars habitable ?
so if we want to be able to understand , if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of mars , if they are there , we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record .
and now , what you see here , we are at 4,500 meters in the andes , but in fact we are less than a billion years after the earth and mars formed .
those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on earth .
life is everywhere , absolutely everywhere .
during u.v . storms there , the u.v . index reaches 43 .
celestial mechanics is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets , and so if we were to discover life on those planets , it would be different from us .
well , organic material is going to tell you about environment , about complexity and about diversity .
dna , or any information carrier , is going to tell you about adaptation , about evolution , about survival , about planetary changes and about the transfer of information .
look at the solar system , and look at the earth .
so yeah , microbes are talking and we are listening , and they are taking us , one planet at a time and one moon at a time , towards their big brothers out there .
and they are telling us about diversity , they are telling us about abundance of life , and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization , intelligence , technology and , indeed , philosophy .
now , i knew i could n't make people feel hungry , but maybe i could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical .
and i did , though , have a really great intern , a woman named michaela kobsa-mark .
as soon as i heard that audio , i knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks .
and again , as i said , we did n't have very much funding , so i had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated , and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could .
so you can hear the surprise in my voice , right ?
and this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over : people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim , trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help , even though they could n't .
so you can see that the basic tenets of journalism , they do n't really change here , right ?
thank you .
hi . i 'm going to talk to you today about laughter , and i just want to start by thinking about the first time i can ever remember noticing laughter .
you can take cuttings ; they can sort of have sex with themselves ; they can pollinate themselves .
but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches .
as i say , every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these .
and that 's actually rather useful for forensics and so on .
so all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
the insects and other species can take the pollen , transfer it directly to where it 's required .
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
and basically what the insect has to do — we 're in the middle of the flower — it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .
and sure enough , there 's the insect .
so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic does n't give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles .
`` here 's arum , arum maculatum , `` '' lords and ladies , '' '' or `` '' cuckoo-pint '' '' in this country . ''
so instead of having starch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it 's burning fat , metabolizing , about the rate of a small cat .
and what a wonderful thing it is .
and many of the tropical flowers are red , and that 's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us , we think , and can see the color red very well .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
well yes we can .
now we do n't know exactly what a bee sees , any more than you know what i 'm seeing when i call this red .
we ca n't know what 's going on in — let alone an insect 's — another human being 's mind .
here 's another little flower — different range of ultraviolet frequencies , different filters to match the pollinators .
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light .
yes , 11 .
i very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion .
why were n't we learning about these women ?
conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things .
there were christians and jews .
but i was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody , and then i went on to the united nations school , and that just completely — so i began sort of developing these voices and these people , all of whom were loosely based on people i really know , and so , for example , in performing them , i would really try to inhabit them .
`` `` '' is dating boring , now that humans reproduce asexually ? '' '' who do we got ? ''
so i think i 've lost my way .
i do n't know why . you know what i 'm saying .
you know what i mean ?
but everybody , please do enjoy that , and again , i think that you do throw a cracking good party here at ted .
next question . ( applause ) what has changed ? okay , it 's like , i have to think about that .
like , not that there 's anything wrong with that , but my mom , she 's like , like , why do you have to wear pants that , like , objectify your body ? i like my pants .
like , i like my voice .
and , you know , i just have to say , the whole thing with baldness , and , you know , here 's the thing .
as long as the woman , in my case — because it 's a modern world , do whatever you want to do , i do n't have any problem with anybody , enjoy yourself , lgbtqlmnop . all right ?
as far as i 'm concerned , it 's about the love .
so that 's it . that 's it . that 's it .
all right , next question .
um , well , i , i want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a chinese-american .
thank you for having me .
i would just like to say as an african woman that i believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside .
there is nothing wrong with a woman of size .
i 'm gon na start off by telling y'all that this is my first time here at ted .
and for me , i think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway .
that 's wonderful , but it 's also about the actual reality here on earth .
how can you be part of the solution ?
and lest you think that you all , as the digerati , are more enlightened , i went to the apple iphone app store the other day .
so in addition to using full-body input , something that i 've explored now , for a while , has been the use of the voice , which is an immensely expressive system for us , vocalizing .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
and as you do , you see the shadows of your own speech .
here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him .
so in addition to the full body , and in addition to the voice , another thing that i 've been really interested in , most recently , is the use of the eyes , or the gaze , in terms of how people relate to each other .
and basically to ask the questions : what if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at , as you see who 's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .
the last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics — for me , new for me .
okay . so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout .
( laughter ) it 's an eight-foot snout , with a googly eye . ( laughter )
and inside it 's got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed , ( laughter ) from a friend . ( laughter )
now , cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water , as you can see there .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
`` this is pink floyd 's `` '' machine '' '' playing in real time through the cymascope . ''
so what does this all mean ?
and think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
i think collectively we can build a global community .
as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time , if you assume that all magnets had to be hard , then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work .
if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material — if a cabinet slams shut it would n't make a loud noise , and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed .
for me , i really love this idea .
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast , so tall , that when you hit the bottom , it uses brakes to stop .
this is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
now , i 'm not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling , the greater the stopping force .
in our brainstorms , we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal : so at the end of the game , you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag .
woman : i 'd make my very own walking stick .
woman : i would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... yeah .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
( laughter ) and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water . ( laughter )
zk : wait , wait , steven — before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
but today it 's most widely used in office buildings — in the sprinkler system — as a fire-suppression fluid .
`` it 's technically called , `` '' shape-retaining property . '' '' now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil . ''
ks : for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off .
do n't let milk spoil your morning .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . prior to seeing this , we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole could n't fit in your pocket ; something as inexpensive as ink could n't sense the way paper is being bent ; every one of these things — and we 're constantly trying to find more .
zk : this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing .
the world needs you , badly .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job .
these math-phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent .
here 's how to relax your anxieties , if you have them : understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages , or like verbal language generally , by its own grammar and system of logic .
ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake .
we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine .
you may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies : march to the sound of the guns .
the two strategies of research , original research , can be stated as follows , in the final principle i 'm going to offer you : for every problem in a given discipline of science , there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution .
find out what they are .
those are people that are going on an airplane .
we send people to the moon , we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like .
yet , our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task .
in its simplest terms , imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object , let 's say cats , and designing a model that learns from these training images .
but what if cats are hidden ?
that 's a lot of training examples .
once we know this , we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before , perhaps thousands of times more , and together with professor kai li at princeton university , we launched the imagenet project in 2007 .
as an example , in the case of cats , we have more than 62,000 cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats .
in a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model , it has 24 million nodes , 140 million parameters , and 15 billion connections .
it became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition .
but surprisingly , car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities , or voting patterns by zip codes .
soon , another developmental milestone will be hit , and children begin to communicate in sentences .
so instead of saying this is a cat in the picture , you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed .
just like the brain integrates vision and language , we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences .
now , i 'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk .
a large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway .
ffl : so of course , when it sees too many cats , it thinks everything might look like a cat .
first , we teach them to see .
then , they help us to see better .
this is my quest : to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for leo and for the world .
( laughter ) and so you 're very conscious in the cockpit ; you 're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do , all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through .
you are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself .
until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we 're weightless .
how do you deal with fear versus danger ?
and you 're holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
and how do you know ?
and so a spider lands on you , and you go through this great , spasmy attack because spiders are scary .
how do you get around it , though ?
it 's just a little bit of fluffy stuff . it 's not a big deal .
if you 're outside on a spacewalk and you 're blinded , your natural reaction would be to panic , i think .
it would make you nervous and worried .
and even if you 're blinded , your natural , panicky reaction does n't happen .
three of us climb in , and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere .
just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
i know it 's a cliche , but look , look how small , how tiny it has gotten .
that 's true .
and what happens next ?
( laughter ) now i should n't get into this .
religion and political cartoons , as you may have heard , make a difficult couple , ever since that day of 2005 , when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world — demonstrations , fatwa , they provoked violence . people died in the violence .
now , talk of a divided place — the country was cut in two .
they can disappear and escape bullets .
`` he said , `` '' i can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life . '' '' i said , `` '' well , maybe we do n't have time for this right now . '' '' ( laughter ) `` another time . '' ''
we brought together cartoonists from all sides in ivory coast .
and i did n't ask them to do nice cartoons .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in ivory coast .
and then in kenya , what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity , which is a poison in a lot of places in africa .
and we did video clips — you can see them if you go to youtube/kenyatoons .
and that 's the message i try to convey to them .
today , tech companies are the world 's largest editors .
and for dictators all over the world , the good news is when cartoonists , journalists and activists shut up .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor 's letter , where i say that rookie , we do n't have all the answers , we 're still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we 've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
thank you . ( applause )
`` when he saw the site , he asked , `` '' this is an impossible dream . ''
this is a dream started by hiram bingham , but we are expanding it to the world , making archaeological exploration more open , inclusive , and at a scale simply not previously possible .
( applause ) thank you .
it has absolutely stunning jewelry , like what you can see here .
it has the nazca lines and amazing textiles .
so as part of the ted prize platform , we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations , first of all with digitalglobe , the world 's largest provider of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery .
national geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration .
my team , headed up by chase childs , is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery .
it dates to 850 ad .
our main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here , dr. luis jaime castillo , professor at catholic university .
as a respected peruvian archaeologist and former vice-minister , dr. castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists so they can explore these sites on the ground .
it 's going to be launched formally by the end of the year .
and there 's several ways of doing this .
and you 're familiar , of course , with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system .
i 'd like to leave you with the following thought : green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get-go .
so we did an experiment .
and i thought the same thing myself when these came out , because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate .
really cool stuff .
no , it 's a hormone called oxytocin .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
so based on these studies , i could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule , and call myself dr. strangelove .
`` we have n't found a `` '' buy '' '' button inside the brain , we ca n't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans , and we ca n't turn sinners into saints with hormones . ''
if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it , do n't just take them at their word .
`` my poem is called `` '' dirt . '' '' my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ; half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar . ''
or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot , into the bushes : like a creature of leaves you 'd lurk , crouched , crawling , simplified , savage , alone ; already there was wanting to be simpler , wanting , when they called you , never to go back .
sorceress , tranced , ecstatic , stock-still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape , passersby flowing around her , her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream , silently though , as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted .
too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts .
( laughter ) besides , for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence . because not an hour ago , while we were on our walk , my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking .
something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured in those days .
how rich i would think , is the lexicon of our self-absolving .
her occupancy , her absolute , faithful attendance .
herself fall .
forever . with grace .
60 nearly , yet these hardly tangible , hardly better than harlots , can still stir me .
i kept finding myself at her page .
sex and death , how close they can seem .
vamp . siren . seductress .
so here you 'll see , on the top right , what the robot sees with the camera .
this is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior .
because these robots are really safe .
and this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots .
you have four robots — one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator , literally .
they 're asked to form a circular shape , and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation , or how many robots you pull out , each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor .
now if you put these ideas together , the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute .
as you well know , one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished .
on the left-center is an infrared camera .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
by combining visual and infrared information , we can also compute indices such as ndvi .
and in this particular case , you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops .
this is easily discernible from imagery , not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery .
now , that 's a pretty bold statement , but if you take nothing else away from this talk , i actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new , it 's also a continuation of a very human story , and the story is this .
eventually with the internet , we put these same institutions online .
so let 's take the first example , not knowing who we 're dealing with .
are they a power user ?
do they have great reviews and ratings , or do they have no profile at all ?
say you 're going to send me that smartphone by mail .
all of these people that go into making a product , they do n't have the same database .
can i get my money back ?
so rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks , our governments , our corporations , we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open .
i 'm going to talk about hackers .
for every hacker that 's trying to steal your identity there 's one that 's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill .
and in many ways , hacking is what built america .
betsy ross was a hacker .
so if there 's one thing i want to leave you here with today , it 's that the next time you think about who a hacker is , you think not of this guy but of this guy , benjamin franklin , who was one of the greatest hackers of all time .
so it 's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the internet .
so keep that in mind .
and so they did something that 's really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
and by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we 're enabling through civic hacking , we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government .
and the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
and in those 10 days , they submitted 173 apps , five of which were presented to congress and are still in the app store today .
we have 31 brigades in the u.s .
thank you .
and if we used the same software on the right video , it lets us see each breath that this infant takes , and we can use this as a contact-free way to monitor her breathing .
so what if we record them with a high-speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high-speed video , and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them ?
but it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant , because with the right algorithms , we can take this silent , seemingly still video and we can recover this sound .
there 's the object and how far away it is ; there 's the camera and the lens that you use ; how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is .
and so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts , we can actually recover sound using a modified version of our algorithm .
and to be fair , it 's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone .
but there 's another important way that we learn about the world : that 's by interacting with it .
so that 's it : just five seconds of regular video , while we bang on this surface , and we 're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object , and we 're going to use that information to create something new and interactive .
and so looking to the future , it 's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world .
my grandfather was a cobbler .
back in the day , he made custom-made shoes .
he perished in the holocaust .
but all of that is about to change with 3d printing , and it all started with this , the very first part that was ever printed .
it was printed in 1983 by chuck hull , who invented 3d printing .
but the thing that i want to talk to you about today , the big idea that i want to discuss with you , is not that 3d printing is going to catapult us into the future , but rather that it 's actually going to connect us with our heritage , and it 's going to usher in a new era of localized , distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication .
when i met amanda for the first time , she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down , but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable .
planetary resources , a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year .
what if we could completely change the experience , like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3d printed ?
with 3d printing , complexity is free .
the printer does n't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape , and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it .
that will take new tools .
( applause )
this is an icon of national geographic , an afghan refugee taken by steve mccurry .
and david said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor .
and finally , the bow of the titanic , without movie stars , photographed by emory kristof .
but i turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty .
but this flashbulb memory , as it 's called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail .
it was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
but once the annual rains began , the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park .
they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory , because they could n't leave it there , because it 's still valuable .
instead of just knowledge of this park , he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants , the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
here , in a photo by brian , a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of baja .
the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home .
they have been rarely photographed , partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean .
now , what leopard seals do mostly is , they eat penguins .
and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
and he said he was never really afraid of this .
and paul said he was never really afraid , because she was more curious about him than threatened .
`` she 'd kind of look at him , like `` '' what are you doing ? '' '' go back and get them , and then bring them back and drop them in front of him . ''
eventually , though , paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .
it is these kinds of stories , ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism .
( applause )
i 'm not multinational .
i 'm not a national at all .
how could i come from a nation ?
how can a human being come from a concept ?
to me , a country — this thing that could be born , die , expand , contract — hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being .
`` `` '' all identity is experience , '' '' i thought . ''
`` see , `` '' taiye selasi comes from the united states , '' '' is n't the truth . ''
both he and udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents ' countries , from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur .
but that 's not quite the point .
as a unit of measurement for human experience , the country does n't quite work .
`` `` '' i 'm a local of lagos and berlin , '' '' suggests overlapping experiences , layers that merge together , that ca n't be denied or removed . ''
that i carry within me .
all of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation , as if knowing what country i came from would tell my audience who i was .
( laughter ) it 's possible that without realizing it , we 're playing a power game , especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries .
`` as any recent immigrant knows , the question `` '' where are you from ? '' '' or `` '' where are you really from ? '' '' is often code for `` '' why are you here ? '' '' then we have the scholar william deresiewicz 's writing of elite american colleges . ''
is it military strength ? well , we have the world 's fourth largest army .
he 's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free , and that 's how he gets orders from the neighborhood , to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed .
the other day i was in kerala , my home state , at the country farm of a friend , about 20 kilometers away from any place you 'd consider urban .
they had to suspend functions at 8:30 .
so the empire can strike back .
as a student in the mid '70s , i knew what the image of india was then , if there was an image at all .
but that too is transforming the indian story around the world .
but , there is something more substantive to that .
the story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism .
but , the fact is that the last elections , five years ago , gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of italian origin and roman catholic faith , sonia gandhi , who then made way for a sikh , mohan singh , to be sworn in as prime minister by a muslim , president abdul kalam , in a country 81 percent hindu .
it was essentially india being itself .
governments are n't very good at telling stories .
and those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note , spelling out the denominations .
we 've got all of that .
where are the costumes ? where are the toys ?
how big of a problem ?
since 1937 , disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls .
why ? because this princess messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses .
and if what we learn , what we know about other people and about the world we learn through media , then these companies are teaching my daughter that even if she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja , all four of which are true of her , it does n't matter .
`` mike is a little boy in florida . he 's 11 years old , and the thing that he loves most in the world is a show called `` '' my little pony : friendship is magic , '' '' like millions of other children across america . ''
so the other kids in his neighborhood pick on mike and they beat him up and they make fun of him , and at 11 years old , mike goes home , finds a belt , wraps it around his neck , and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed .
and if the answer is no , then it 's for boys and girls .
it 's really simple .
so i 'll read it to you .
`` i was like , `` '' what ? ''
`` why ca n't i change something that has happened for a long time in our community ? '' '' that was when i called other girls just like my sister , who have children , who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write . ''
one is a dust tail , which is blown away by the solar wind .
so what 's important to remember ?
and thus , the rosetta mission was approved in 1993 , and originally it was supposed to be launched in 2003 , but a problem arose with an ariane rocket .
this particular comet has been in the solar system since 1959 .
it 's the first satellite to orbit a comet , and to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system — closest approach to the sun , as we will see in august , and then away again to the exterior .
it 's the first ever landing on a comet .
here you see in white the trajectory , and the way this works .
we had to do eight maneuvers , and you see here , some of them were really big .
now , this led to a selection of landing sites .
so we had to know the velocity of rosetta much better than one centimeter per second , and its location in space better than 100 meters at 500 million kilometers from earth .
there is a long-term variation , which in itself is not surprising , but you see the sharp peaks .
so this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet .
so we 've been rather lucky that we are where we are .
this is one of the iconic images of rosetta .
( applause ) one of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander .
( applause )
the tv 's on at full volume .
and they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes .
these are just containment measures , ways of managing a problem .
when we made this chart , the frontline workers , the professionals — they stared at it absolutely amazed .
`` so ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door , `` what will you do when my son starts kicking me ? '' ''
and one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise .
and then some remarkable changes took place .
and circle also offers a rich social calendar — knitting , darts , museum tours , hot air ballooning — you name it .
so let me tell you about belinda .
but the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed , friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services .
but here , too , the systems are failing .
but guess how most people find work today ?
so it 's friends that tell you about a job , it 's friends that recommend you for a job , and it 's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work .
at the end of his life , in 1948 , beveridge wrote a third report .
( applause )
i am not a luddite .
we 're losing a ritual .
this may actually be heresy to say this at ted , but i 'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation , i think , in medicine to come in the next 10 years , and that is the power of the human hand — to touch , to comfort , to diagnose and to bring about treatment .
and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope .
one was scratching at the end of the stick , another child listened at the other end .
and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance .
and fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two , three nights , that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time — almost a tribute to this physician .
i want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when i was in training .
the focus was around the patient .
and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
and she found the place and decided to go there , went there .
they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ; they had no need to touch her breasts .
i was very influenced by that anecdote .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to disappoint them .
and i learned very early on with my first patient that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of 45 minutes .
`` and when i was done , the patient said to me with some awe , `` i have never been examined like this before . '' ''
the good news , it 's not cancer , it 's not tuberculosis , it 's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection .
we signal transitions of power with rituals .
and out of that sense of failure , i remember , i would always examine the patient .
i would percuss the chest . i would listen to the heart .
i remember so many huge , hollowed out , haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual .
when he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth , his hands moved as if in slow motion .
it was an offering , an invitation .
although , god knows , of late , in our hubris , we seem to have drifted away .
we seem to have forgotten — as though , with the explosion of knowledge , the whole human genome mapped out at our feet , we are lulled into inattention , forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician , necessary for the patient — forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient .
i will never abandon you .
i always wanted to be outside the box .
and it 's partly because i came to this field from a different background , chemist and a bacterial geneticist .
trillion !
there it comes , these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes .
so , scientists were very excited , and they said , a single oncogene can do it .
and many of you know how it looks , except that inside that breast , there are all these pretty , developing , tree-like structures .
look at the nuclei . the nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
on the left is what 's inside the animal , we call it in vivo , and the one in culture was full of milk , the lovely red there is full of milk .
this is what we got .
( applause ) and in order to show you that the malignant phenotype i did n't just choose one , here are little movies , sort of fuzzy , but you see that on the left are the malignant cells , all of them are malignant , we add one single inhibitor in the beginning , and look what happens , they all look like that .
so , it 's a new way of thinking about cancer , it 's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer .
curiosity and passion .
what do they do in the beginning when they do ?
we did n't have high images in the old days .
and when we revert the cancer cell , it again does this .
absolutely boggles my mind .
and unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
in the last year ?
they eat about one-third , and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world .
`` and i followed this one pig with number `` '' 05049 , '' '' all the way up until the end and to what products it 's made of . ''
and this also actually happens with tuna and scallops .
so , with the steak , you might drink a beer .
and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings , so the collagen is as well .
and the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic .
and i think that , in order to take better care of what 's behind our products — so , the livestock , the crops , the plants , the non-renewable materials , but also the people that produce these products — the first step would actually be to know that they are there .
and then , almost inevitably , i became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one .
one man is traumatized for life .
what i 've done with it sitting still , going back to it in my head , trying to understand it , finding a place for it in my thinking , that 's lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
and we all know that it 's really one of our greatest luxuries , the empty space .
now , in the physical domain , of course , many people , if they have the resources , will try to get a place in the country , a second home .
( laughter ) and every season i do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend 's birthday party .
i have never once had to use a cell phone there .
i was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind los angeles , where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob leonard cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the mount baldy zen center .
`` and i was n't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of `` '' old ideas , '' '' went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others . ''
something in us , i think , is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that .
so you can go on your next vacation to paris or hawaii , or new orleans ; i bet you 'll have a wonderful time .
what color is my shirt ? what color is my tie ?
grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
yet you had something inside your pocket .
j : yeah . i 'm saving it for later .
ar : you 've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way , better than you know .
there is some science about this .
the separation barrier was changed completely to the internationally recognized green line , and the women of budrus came to be known across the west bank for their indomitable energy .
this period , though , was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing in the forms of strikes , sit-ins and the creation of parallel institutions .
she 's been omitted , ignored , like so many other women who played critical roles in the united states civil rights movement .
and you see the female line since 1984 , the gap is widening .
so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies , which had been developed in men , by men , for men for the last 50 years — and they work pretty well in men , do n't they ? — were n't working so well for women .
and they 're just passed .
it funds research all over the place .
it told us about hormone replacement therapy .
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die , compared to men who have heart attacks and die — and again , this is millions of people , happening every day — women , in their fatty plaque — and this is their coronary artery , so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle — women erode , men explode .
and you can see , it 's lumpy bumpy .
so 50 years of honing and crafting these angiograms , we easily recognize male-pattern disease .
so that was a discovery .
ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively .
and those little red boxes are deaths .
because women bring new life into the world .
these are female and male stem cells .
one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology — because again , as much as we 're talking about women and heart disease , women do , on average , have better longevity than men — is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
you now , hopefully , have a more personal relationship with your heart .
women 's health , from a federal funding standpoint , sometimes it 's popular , sometimes it 's not so popular .
now , i 'm a documentary filmmaker , so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio , my next instinct was to make a movie .
now , there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement , but the first one we 're going to start with is the 1955 montgomery bus boycott .
when it got to the supreme court in 2013 , the supreme court agreed , and doma was thrown out .
so this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again , and i was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time .
man : no . karess taylor-hughes : okay . how old are you ?
nobody has that power to say , you ca n't marry that young lady .
man 2 : i got you .
what 's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is , it really shows how karess understands the history of the civil rights movement , but she 's not restricted by it .
it calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate : a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor .
i just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who 's no longer with us , nelson mandela of south africa .
to understand how this device works , we have to look into our brains .
and we can ask : how similar are the responses across all listeners ?
and as you can see , this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds , but it did n't spread deeper into the brain .
and when we did that , we did n't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language , because the language and sound are very different .
here we 're asking : how similar are they ?
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
so we did the following experiment .
this alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic concept ; it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems .
if everything worked as planned tonight , i used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains .
i 've got brown eyes ; you might have blue or gray .
( laughter ) right . all together now .
and in the 1970s and '80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
there 's a diagram like this for your brain , but there 's no way it would fit on this slide .
your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters .
i did n't ask you to chant it because it 's true ; i just want you to remember it .
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
let 's zoom in on one synapse , and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse .
if we can do that throughout all the images , we could find a connectome .
or maybe really , really fine capellini with branches .
`` so when show my friends this , sometimes they 've told me , `` '' you know , sebastian , you should just give up . ''
i do not know , but i hope that i will live to see that day , because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time .
synapses can be created , and they can be eliminated .
what 's in this picture ?
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes .
( laughter ) what a mess — have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
( laughter ) i estimate , millions of miles , all packed in your skull .
philosophers know this game very well .
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics .
( applause )
and i became a school hero .
my father 's a little different .
and he was very impressed . he was all tearing up . ready to hug me .
`` and i said , `` '' hold that thought . '' '' i said , `` '' can i quit school then ? '' '' but , to cut a long story short , i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist . ''
i would do birthday parties , weddings , divorces , anything for anyone who wanted to use my services .
( applause ) thank you .
this is one i remember fondly .
what was , for me , a very naive observation , turned out to be a disaster .
that 's when i realized , you know , cartoons are really powerful , art comes with responsibility .
i quit my job at the papers , i closed my school , and i wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks , and i decided to go traveling .
they are ruthless , they are honest , but they 're full of energy and fun .
`` they said , `` '' stop saying sorry . say , my bad . '' '' ( laughter ) then i said , all this is good , but i want to paint like a real painter . ''
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a billboard painter .
something happened along the line .
i was really happy . i thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar .
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding .
i lost all my audiences .
`` the collectors , the friends , the press , everyone said , `` '' nice , but thank you . '' '' `` `` no thank you , '' '' was more like it . ''
and i talked about the weakness of male sexuality .
it turned nasty , and i 'm a bit of a chicken .
so netra and i wound up our life , closed up everything we had , and we decided to move to new york .
they , in fact , told me three weeks .
and i drew it out for her .
for me , my art is my magic carpet ride .
i hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
there has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in .
but i 'm happy to say now that the world has moved on , music has moved on with it .
and in my game , that means you overgesticulate .
you become a figure of fun . there 's no trust anymore , only ridicule .
and i remember at the beginning of my career , again and again , on these dismal outings with orchestras , i would be going completely insane on the podium , trying to engender a small scale crescendo really , just a little upsurge in volume .
they do n't read music .
and if i can broaden this out for a second , i 'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity , with total confidence , about movies , probably about literature .
a very simple tune based on three notes — t , e , d .
if i sing you a musical scale : a , b , c , d , e , f , g — and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet , same scale : h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t — there you go .
( music ) do you hear it ?
( music ) oh my goodness me , there it was loud and clear , surely .
ch : once more with vim . ( audience : t , e , d. ) there i am like a bloody windmill again , you see .
the music will start , and then at a signal from me , you will sing that .
i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had .
normally when you improvise — and i do it all the time around the world — there 's this initial period of horror , like everyone 's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring , an awful pregnant silence .
now in this room with these four disabled musicians , within five minutes a rapt listening , a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music .
it 's removed some of my paralysis .
where there is no trust , the music quite simply withers away .
i would be willing to bet that i 'm the dumbest guy in the room because i could n't get through school . i struggled with school .
kids , when we grow up , have dreams , and we have passions , and we have visions , and somehow we get those things crushed .
`` when i was in grade two , i won a city-wide speaking competition , but nobody had ever said , `` '' hey , this kid 's a good speaker . ''
so as kids show these traits — and we need to start looking for them — i think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers .
we have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us , and i think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial , we could change everything in the world that is a problem today .
every problem that 's out there , somebody has the idea for .
the reason that i avoided an mba program — other than the fact that i could n't get into any because i had a 61 percent average out of high school and then 61 percent average at the only school in canada that accepted me , carlton — but our mba programs do n't teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
they teach them to go work in corporations .
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
all three of the founders of netscape had it .
i 'm also quoted — and i told the person who wrote the textbook — i 'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian university and college studies .
but kids , you can see these signs in them .
`` the definition of an entrepreneur is `` '' a person who organizes , operates and assumes the risk of a business venture . '' '' that does n't mean you have to go to an mba program . ''
it does n't mean you have to get through school .
it just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut .
and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers .
this one person offered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half .
i learned that at a young age .
and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids .
but it was obvious to me , right ? buy low , sell high .
there 's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the u.s. economy .
go get some of that . and i learned that at a young age .
he had all these old automotive parts lying around .
strangely enough , 30 years later , we 're building 1-800-got-junk ?
i learned that manual labor really sucks .
but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that , i realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing .
every week , i would go to the corner store and buy all these pops .
this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you 're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time .
supply , demand , big opportunity .
why do n't you teach them not to waste money ?
fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
we have all these lessons in front of us , but we do n't take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tutor .
look for that kind of stuff .
we would n't have have that stuff , right ?
and what i found was quite surprising .
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for abuse .
and to keep the many from tyrannizing the one , we came up with concepts like individual liberty .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .
but i agreed to come and say a few things about this .
i 've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i 'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface , we just did n't know how to do it at the time .
and we can give everyone in the world a $ 100 computer or a $ 10 computer in the next 15 years .
if we take carbon nanotubes , you know , iijima discovered them in 1991 , they just have incredible properties .
they 're very , very stiff . they stretch very , very little .
ethanol — new ways of making ethanol .
new ways of making electric transportation .
we need networks that can find out what 's going on .
cocktails , more polyvalent vaccines .
if we let an unlimited amount of power loose , then we will — a very small number of people will be able to abuse it .
well , you have to hold people accountable .
but that 's the price of having a civilization .
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
around the same time , i met like-minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers , adventurers , spelunkers , guerrilla historians , etc .
when i first went in , i was scared , because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
when i got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big playground .
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
after exploring recently-abandoned buildings , i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast : your home , your office , a shopping mall , a church — any man-made structures around you .
i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are .
i saw the structure while i was on the train , and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement , which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also , at some point , to hide groups of jewish refugees .
i explored there extensively in the off-limits areas and fell in love right away .
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century , the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats , so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .
this was taken under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located .
nearby there 's a french bunker , and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met .
this is the tower of saint jacques .
this was probably the toughest place to explore .
i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes — i guess , except for in this picture .
this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple .
my right eye was removed at seven months of age .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge .
i call it my freedom staff .
but really , truly — often you think about letting go way before your body does .
number two : hesitation is bad .
you get to the last pitch . it 's easy .
but you also ca n't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete .
rule number five : know how to rest .
you 're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you 're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively .
`` this is the devils tower in wyoming , which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from `` '' close encounters . '' '' with this , typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing . ''
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it 's sort of natural — they carry you all day long .
( applause )
and for me , the man of steel , christopher reeve , has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people .
and this is how i started my own personal journey in this field of research , working with the christopher and dana reeve foundation .
this was more than 10 years ago , but ever since , my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury .
it turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology , starting with the nobel prize sherrington , had shown that the spinal cord , below most injuries , contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion , but because input from the brain is interrupted , they are in a nonfunctional state , like kind of dormant .
so here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation .
imagine , this is really cool .
( laughter ) actually , the first results were very , very , very disappointing .
we were so frustrated .
we insisted . we refined our paradigm , and after several months of training , the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand , and whenever she decided , initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards .
it took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
i mean , how is it possible ?
this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center , and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron .
this is truly a trans-disciplinary team .
and my hope is that after several months of training , there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot , maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation .
( applause )
but race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures .
the food and drug administration has even approved a race-specific medicine .
i thought i 'd tell you a little about what i like to write .
as i say in my book , i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bible literally ?
i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally , without picking and choosing .
the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles .
i had christian bibles .
so i wanted to follow those .
`` the bible says you can not wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so i thought , `` '' sounds strange , but i 'll try it . '' '' you only know if you try it . ''
you change your behavior , and you change your mind .
so , it really was cognitive psychology — you know , cognitive dissonance — that i was experiencing .
( laughter ) but it 's a big part of the bible , so i figured i had to address it .
how was the bible written ?
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
i went to the creationists ' museum .
and it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
so , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when i came over here , the car did n't flip over , and i did n't trip coming up the stairs .
and i 'm trying to start it as a movement .
so , i spent time with evangelical christians , and hasidic jews , and the amish .
i 'm very proud because i think i 'm the only person in america to out bible-talk a jehovah 's witness .
that 's how they printed them in the old bibles .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
`` if a guy from mars came down and saw , here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics , would the martians say , 'well , that guy , he makes sense , but that guy 's crazy ? ' '' '' so no , i think that rituals are , by nature , irrational . ''
because you ca n't .
`` or , my favorite , the `` '' love you ; mean it . '' '' ( laughter ) nothing says `` '' i love you '' '' like `` '' let me find somebody else i give a damn about . '' '' or , this one , coming to us from india . ''
there might be somebody on one right now , participating in multi-dimensional engagement .
we 've met a lot of people .
and we 've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons , our jails and our immigration detention centers , giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time .
he committed a crime ; he 's paying his debt , and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again .
i 'd like to introduce you to james right now , and he 's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word .
ted , welcome to san quentin .
this piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time .
surrounded by tall , concrete walls , steel bars , where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow .
but i 've come to the stark realization that prison — it really is what you make it .
the key : forgiveness .
'cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
'cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
in the meantime , from the beginning , this series has a protesting , reflective and uncompromising spirit .
as you can see , these works are about family planning , election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the people 's congress .
`` this work is called xia gang ( `` '' leaving post '' '' ) . ''
so i tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers .
interpreter : so i tried to disappear into jr 's eye , but the problem is jr uses only models with big eyes .
so i tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture .
interpreter : this is the ancient city of pompeii .
these phosphors can even cause cancer .
to create this artwork , i bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups and put them in my studio , making it look like a supermarket .
and so i thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding british accent might help things a bit .
hi sweetheart . okay .
and — oh , i saw goldie hawn .
yeah , she 's lovely .
you know , i could n't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .
but i — i also appreciate the diversity that you have here .
what are you allowed to say or not say ?
( laughter ) the point is , i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .
congratulations . mazel tov .
sorry , this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything , to be here right now .
i mean i know it 's a real person and everything , but i 'm just saying that like , you know , i think it 's very cool how it 's also an acronym , you know , which is like , you know , is like very high concept and everything like that .
because , actually , i 'm a sophomore at college right now .
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
and if you do n't mind , privately now , in the future , i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology , entertainment and dominicans .
in fact , the older lady you just met : very , very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side .
although , you know , it was wonderful .
for example , a friend of mine .
but , you know , i am originally from india , and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california , originally , i was very pleased and , frankly , relieved because , you know , i am a human rights advocate .
my name is pauline ning , and first i want to tell you that i 'm — of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york .
and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition , but it 's very hard .
so , then i decide instead , i will concentrate on my daughter .
and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference .
so you will get the extra credit i promised you .
and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent , in time .
it 's been a long time coming , and i feel like i 'm home .
the whole thing is amazing , and so do n't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon .
and my childhood is more hick than i could ever possibly relate to you , and also more intellectual than you would ever expect .
and if the tv was on , we were watching a documentary .
but two of the main things : one of it , i was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible .
`` and then my other second set of rules — i hate to say `` '' rules '' '' because it 's art — my criteria would be the three h 's , which is head , heart and hands . ''
`` and it would have `` '' hand '' '' in that it would be greatly crafted . ''
i 'm going to do an international biennial ; i need artists from all around the world .
so i should start to talk about these guys .
i know i should mention : i 'm making all these things .
this is n't photoshopped .
`` this piece , which is called `` '' flipped earth '' '' — she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground . ''
the sun rises , and it melts away .
and that was played by my mom .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
and the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off .
and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is .
this next project , this is by jaochim parisvega , and he 's interested in — he believes art is everywhere waiting — that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen .
and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces , like in his series where he used rain to make paintings .
and you would carry this around with you , and if everything went to hell , you could make payments and buy your life .
this is by a duo , michael abernathy and bud holland .
you know , we look down a dark alley or a jungle path , trying to make out a face or a creature .
so he pairs these up .
( laughter ) the next artist is hazel clausen .
and also they reference how the uvula — everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
so this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we 've become .
this is from estelle willoughsby .
thanks .
now , maui was terrified of the dark , so i had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology , and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
i 'm a novelist , and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
now , the flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a grain of sand , in the budding of a little bud into a rose .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
what happens when time warps ?
news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi .
its focus , instead , is to distract us at every turn on the road .
for some reason , technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does , and then , like an ironic slap in the face , it makes it true .
if i were a child today , i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks , but it really would n't be the same , because much later , i went to vienna , and i went to the spanish riding school , and i could feel my grandfather right beside me .
it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes , obesity , many forms of heart disease , even some forms of cancer — when you think of smoking .
and doctors hate it , right ?
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
so that was the low-fear group .
they said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies , and ultimately , yes , they would lose their teeth .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you were n't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you were n't going to be able to eat apples , you were n't going to be able to eat steak .
the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all .
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work , who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one — that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
so fear does n't work , right ? fear does n't work .
so you start with personalized data , personalized information that comes from an individual , and then you need to connect it to their lives .
and that does n't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers — this overload of health information that we 're inundated with .
there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us .
they last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .
maybe there 's fewer accidents , so there 's public health benefits .
so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information , and it just sounds perfect .
it is n't this kind of vague promise that it 's going to work no matter what , but you get the statistics for how effective it is .
every time you take a drug , you 're walking into a possible side effect .
so that 's what i want to walk you through .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate .
so that 's our general blood work test .
( laughter ) quest diagnostics and labcorp , the two largest lab testing companies — last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively .
we need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor , should not be the insurance company .
it should be the patient .
that 's what engagement is . it 's different from compliance .
i 've been talking today about latent information , all this information that exists in the system that we 're not putting to use .
but there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online , and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people , to help people and to change the course of their lives .
well , i was studying physics at the beginning and i took this approximation of a human as a gigantic lego piece .
( applause ) not the man in the flesh , but for the first time in history , this is the genome of a specific human , printed page-by-page , letter-by-letter : 262,000 pages of information , 450 kilograms , shipped from the united states to canada thanks to bruno bowden , lulu.com , a start-up , did everything .
chromosome 14 , book 132 : ( laughter ) as you might expect . ( laughter )
`` `` att , ctt , gatt . '' ''
this human is lucky , because if you miss just two letters in this position — two letters of our three billion — he will be condemned to a terrible disease : cystic fibrosis .
( laughter ) and so , in 2014 , two famous tedsters , peter diamandis and craig venter himself , decided to assemble a new company .
what are those letters , and what do they do ?
so we started to ask our questions : can we predict height ?
can we predict eye color ?
and it was a very emotional moment .
we predict his age , 38 .
we predict his eye color .
we certainly do n't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood .
it 's called personalized medicine .
and it 's a revolution that can not be confined in the domain of science or technology .
and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device .
because if we can manufacture it after we 've discovered it , we could deploy it anywhere .
we can download new diagnostics .
so this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
beam me up , scotty .
getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it .
even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
and colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice .
in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate ?
`` many years ago my teacher wrote , `` '' when students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy . '' '' just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iphone , so also people can be sold more and more education . ''
i think it 's a high school discount .
everybody else seems to .
there is such a thing , by the way .
well , first of all , how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale ?
jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you 're very small .
so this shows what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg , and you can see the silicone rubber joints and there 's an embedded magnet that 's being moved around by an external magnetic field .
we want sensing , power , control , actuation all together , and not everything needs to be bio-inspired .
so i think i 've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe .
it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination .
it can know how we 're holding it .
and i do n't mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
( music ) speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their pcs , they have n't been able to get out .
`` a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , `` '' oh , i saw a fox today . '' '' a child in india says , `` '' i saw a monkey today . '' '' and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you 've actually taken . ''
let 's pretend it 's the year 2030 , and you 're a parent .
if you 're honest with yourself , she 's smarter than you , and she 's five years old .
she 's beautiful , tall , athletic , and the list goes on and on .
you were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week that a study of these children who were born as designer babies indicates they may have some issues , like increased aggressiveness and narcissism .
`` marianne 's been crying , and last night when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight , she said , `` '' daddy , will jenna even be my friend anymore ? '' '' so now , as i 've been telling you this imagined 2030 story , i have a feeling that i may have put some of you into this sci-fi frame of reference . right ? ''
and we may find ourselves in that reality , and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today .
and if you 're still kind of thinking in sci-fi mode , consider that the world of science had a huge shock earlier this year , and the public largely does n't even know about it .
what actually is crispr ?
it 's really that simple .
what is better when we 're talking about a human being ?
and yet coming with it would be these risks .
so if we forget about enhancing people and we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification , this technology is so new and so powerful , that by accident we could make them sicker .
there 's actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in washington , d.c .
we have to ban this .
and i think part of the problem that we have is that all of this trend , this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans , the public has n't known about it .
several years ago , i was working at the south side walnut cafe , a local diner in town , and during my time there i would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity : not shaving my armpits , quoting ani difranco lyrics as gospel .
the dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid .
so i promised myself , the next time , i would say something .
my hair is short like a boy 's , and i wear boy 's clothes , but i 'm a girl , and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress , and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies ?
`` well , i 'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl . '' '' and this kid looks me dead in the eye , without missing a beat , and says , `` '' my favorite pajamas are purple with fish . ''
number one : be authentic .
if you tell your parents you might be gay , they will hold out hope that this will change .
those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
three years later — a lot of programming , working with other graduate students in the lab — kismet was ready to start interacting with people .
( video ) scientist : i want to show you something .
he 's a scary monster .
he 's a psychologist we 've been collaborating with .
there 's actually a scientist carefully controlling nexi 's cues to be able to study this question .
this is a robot , autom .
it could share information looking down at a screen .
it could help you set goals and track your progress , and it would help motivate you .
so an interesting question is , does the social embodiment really matter ? does it matter that it 's a robot ?
because the challenge is not losing weight , it 's actually keeping it off .
so the first thing i want to look at is how long , how long did people interact with these systems .
when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .
so here 's the first exploration of this idea , where characters can be physical or virtual , and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back .
but we can push this idea further .
i want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own .
what they care about is the robot .
pat mitchell : your first time back on the tedwomen stage .
`` yesterday my daughter was clinging to my leg , and `` '' do n't go . '' '' and you looked at me and said , you have to tell that story . ''
and i did . and i think that 's a really important part of the journey .
`` and part of my journey , starting on this stage , going to `` '' lean in , '' '' going to the foundation , is all about being more open and honest about those challenges , so that other women can be more open and honest , and all of us can work together towards real equality . ''
so he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more , and it still did n't work .
so i do n't know if i 'm an expert , or if anyone is an expert . i certainly have done a lot of research .
it 's a word that 's pretty much not used for little boys , because if a little boy leads , there 's no negative word for it , it 's expected . but if a little girl leads , she 's bossy .
( laughter ) that is what audiences have said in every country in the world , and it 's deeply supported by the data .
pm : can we send that to a lot of other people that we know ? ( applause ) ss : and so john is doing that because he believes it 's good for his company , and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it .
one of the governors of one of the states told me that he did n't realize that more women were , in fact , literally sitting on the side of the room , which they are , and now he made a rule that all the women on his staff need to sit at the table .
what part of that has surprised you , and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ?
there are dress-for-success groups in texas which are using the book , for women who have never been to college .
and what we 're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold .
( laughter ) seriously , please find any way to get in touch with me , and let 's see what we can build .
it 's a very desolate place .
there are all sorts of things that we do and think that we 're willing to tell our physician or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse or our best friend that we would be mortified for the rest of the world to learn .
the reason is that when we 're in a state where we can be monitored , where we can be watched , our behavior changes dramatically .
it renders off-limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it 's happened .
tell us a little bit about that .
`` bg : i 'm curious about your relationship with ed snowden , because you have spoken with him a lot , and you certainly continue doing so , but in your book , you never call him edward , nor ed , you say `` '' snowden . '' '' how come ? ''
to me , that 's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated .
the wind will move feathers on their back , which will drive their feet .
in fact , it 's a new invention of the wheel .
`` there are not that many things on earth that are `` '' almost everything . '' '' productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society . ''
from '73 to '83 : three percent per annum .
one , the one i prefer , is rigorous , elegant , nice — math .
this is what we will do today .
and this year , the us team is in great shape .
this is math .
those who carry the baton are slower , but their baton is faster .
with cooperation , we can do more with less .
if you say 97 , after 97 meters , people will drop the baton , whether there is someone to take it or not .
you have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton , to signal that you are arriving , so that the next runner can prepare , can anticipate .
`` you can not say , `` '' is it you ? '' '' too late ! ''
it is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers , to build advantage on a global scale , to create value .
am i putting my energy in what can get measured — my legs , my speed — or in passing the baton ?
( laughter ) eighteen minutes , clearly impossible .
one , two , three , four , five , six and seven .
now i had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly .
they have to be precisely lathed .
oh , when i was buying the clubs , somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others .
well i did n't think much of it at the time .
so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission .
i lift the balancing pole . i approach the edge .
i put my left foot on the cable , the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building .
but it is too late .
so each time i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character i created 45 years ago , i am as happy as when i am in the clouds .
but the dove , who obviously did n't go to flying school , goes flop , flop , flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole .
they had become one , pushing me to triumph .
`` the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , `` '' leymah , take my daughter . ''
`` i wish for her to be a nurse . '' '' dirt poor , living in the home with my parents , i could n't afford to . ''
i wish to go with you .
`` i wish to go to school . '' '' dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , i again said , `` '' no . '' '' two months later , both of those villages fell into another war . ''
her dream of going to school , her wish of being educated , is finally here .
and for the next three years , her fate will be having sex with him every day , as a favor for getting her in school .
`` one day she said to me , `` '' my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . '' '' she 's at a place where she ca n't find money to go to school . ''
i wish for a better life .
i wish for food for my children .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman — i failed , i failed , i failed .
we set up a foundation .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there 's another liberian girl , ghanaian girl , nigerian girl , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
`` and maybe , just maybe , saying , `` '' because of that nobel laureate i 'm here today . '' '' so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope . ''
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
and we could not find 25 girls in high school .
`` but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , `` '' what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? '' '' and one of the guys who already had a seat was very — because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric . ''
just being out on the street was exhilarating .
so to give you an idea of what that 's like , i 'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle , and show you what an amazing journey it 's taken me on .
( music ) ( applause ) it is the most amazing experience , beyond most other things i 've experienced in life .
and the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too .
for me , this means that they 're seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
you 're all part of the artwork too .
what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life ?
and another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous .
( laughter ) and we 're constantly told to lean in to work , to push harder and achieve more .
and the second group that we 've followed was a group of boys from boston 's poorest neighborhoods , boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boston of the 1930s .
we draw their blood , we scan their brains , we talk to their children .
it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family , to friends , to community , are happier , they 're physically healthier , and they live longer than people who are less well connected .
people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy , their health declines earlier in midlife , their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely .
the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80 .
and the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships do n't just protect our bodies , they protect our brains .
some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out , but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough , those arguments did n't take a toll on their memories .
what might leaning in to relationships even look like ?
it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together , long walks or date nights , or reaching out to that family member who you have n't spoken to in years , because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges .
`` more than a century ago , he was looking back on his life , and he wrote this : `` '' there is n't time , so brief is life , for bickerings , apologies , heartburnings , callings to account . ''
now open your eyes .
what you see here is a premature baby .
four million of these babies die annually .
what you see here looks nothing like an incubator .
it looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
looks simple , but we 've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
we hope that the embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
in doing this , i believe we can truly bring technology to the masses .
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an embrace .
basho , in 17 syllables , juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past , and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars , probably hundreds and hundreds of — who knows how many — planets , maybe even an ocean that we will probably call sylvia in time .
( laughter ) sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans .
i hope it will be .
volcanoes erupt .
part of the urgency comes from the fact that , of order , a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving .
it 's an astonishing insight , and we have only found out about this recently .
it may be the next rainforest , in terms of pharmaceuticals .
but without data , those models will never ever be predicted .
and the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins , utilizing widely accessible , interactive telepresence .
and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites .
i wo n't talk a lot about most of them right here , but the one on the west coast , that 's in the box , is called the regional scale nodes .
it was once called neptune .
this is phenomenal bandwidth .
we are already laced up as if we 're in a fiber optic corset , if you like .
climate change , ocean acidification , dissolved oxygen , carbon cycle , coastal upwelling , fishing dynamics — the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume .
in conjunction with our canadian colleagues , we 've set this up .
there 's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will , if those are your experiments .
this is what it actually looks like .
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
this is doable . all the pieces are there .
a laboratory : many of you heard what happened on 9/7 .
it 's going to be amazing .
it wo n't be long . it wo n't be long .
so finally , they decided to do a biopsy , and two weeks later , the results of the biopsy came back .
my story might be , unfortunately , familiar to most of you .
the context , of course , is that we 're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates , and the biological realm is no exception .
just as personal computers or the internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship , politics or education , recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well , and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches .
another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same , but at the microrna level , there are patterns .
if we can have a camera here so you can see my screen .
and then , when this entire process is over , this is what happens .
this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time .
since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized , this entire solution costs at least 50 times less than current available methods , and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more , so we 're making the design of the device open-source .
you do n't need to have any symptoms .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but i 'm still gay — ( laughter ) — is evidence of both my mother 's influence and its limits . ( laughter )
`` ( applause ) when i was little , my mother used to say , `` '' the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world . ''
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
and after i came out of the closet , when she continued to say it , it made me furious .
`` i said , `` '' i 'm gay . that 's not the direction that i 'm headed in . ''
i went to deaf clubs .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
`` and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . '' '' i 'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s . ''
one of the families i interviewed , tom and karen robards , were taken aback when , as young and successful new yorkers , their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
but i think it 's a tragedy when one of them does n't see the other .
and when i see the way they 're intersecting in conditions like the three i 've just described , i sometimes think it 's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan .
`` this is what we hear when you pray for a cure — that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . '' '' it 's a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they do n't want to be cured or changed or eliminated . ''
one of the families i interviewed for this project was the family of dylan klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the columbine massacre .
( applause ) so the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states .
and i wanted also to protect myself from illness .
your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like .
she thinks she 's dreaming , but she 's not .
`` and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front , crowds and crowds of people , `` '' take my child ! take my child ! '' '' and passing her son to someone through a window . ''
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
i went on to cover many , many , many wars after that , so many that i lost count , but there was nothing like sarajevo .
i believe a story there has to be told .
and then war and chaos descend .
who cares about the congo , the ivory coast , liberia , sierra leone , all of these strings of places that i will remember for the rest of my life ?
i started with paragliding .
the one with the yellow-green suit , he 's flying head-down .
from freeflying i went on to skysurfing .
`` of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning — we call it `` '' helicopter moves . '' '' from there i went on to wingsuit flying . ''
if i put some tension on my body , tension on my suit , i can make it fly . and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface .
with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance .
this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro .
you can see the copacabana on the left-hand side .
so for 2009 , i 'm training hard for my two new projects .
jc : all right . well we will watch this space . but i have two more questions .
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
ue : the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
75 percent of americans think alaska is part of canada .
`` buying it from us screams good taste . '' '' ( laughter ) or this that i found in a magazine called california lawyer , in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at enron . ''
the head is good , body bad .
`` i know this because i read in the new york times , the ayn rand foundation took out a full-page ad after september 11 , in which they said , `` '' the problem is not iraq or iran , the problem in this country , facing this country is the university professors and their spawn . '' '' ( laughter ) so i went back and re-read `` '' the fountainhead . '' '' ( laughter ) i do n't know how many of you have read it . ''
it 's the subject subjugating the object .
you make yourself the active voice .
i think ringling brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the new york times magazine .
( laughter ) what 's funny about being down to four houses ? ( laughter )
but i always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction , in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content , to some degree , of what you 're talking about .
i know that word is so debased now by the use of it by internet marketers .
i really miss the old telemarketers now , i 'll tell you that .
like for instance a mime once — or a meme as he called himself .
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly .
that 's an actual quality of the trickster .
but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store .
`` huh ? huh ? what ? ca n't hear you . '' '' ( laughter ) and another attribute of the trickster is smart luck . ''
yes of course you got that . thank you very much .
`` and the daughter says , as tactfully as possible , `` mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ? '' ''
and you know the biggest hurdle for me , in doing what i do , is constructing my performance so that it 's prepared and unprepared .
it 's an actual thing .
i want to say to you richard , in closing , that in ted you 've created a home .
( laughter ) but i think we 're looking for something more .
we had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
well , i think what is far worse is man 's destructive power over man .
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
`` ansel adams said , and i 'm going to disagree with him , `` you do n't take a photograph , you make it . '' ''
what has the war on drugs done to the world ?
( applause ) but here 's the good news .
it 's good people who have lost their jobs , their homes , their freedom , even their children to the state , not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another .
now , could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal ? probably .
the obstacles to reform lie not just out there in the power of the prison industrial complex or other vested interests that want to keep things the way they are , but within each and every one of us .
it 's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform .
and ultimately , i think that boils down to the kids , and to every parent 's desire to put our baby in a bubble , and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk .
first , do n't do drugs .
that was a powerful talk .
if anything , it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk .
who here ca n't remember thinking , well , looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids ?
let 's say you 're in love . all right ?
you know , you 're thinking about your own mortality .
those are common clouds .
what about rarer ones , like the lenticularis , the ufo-shaped lenticularis cloud ?
they are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere .
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
climate change is affecting our homes , our communities , our way of life . we should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity .
it 's already fueled conflicts in chad and darfur .
infrastructure is going to be affected .
new york city is incredibly vulnerable to storms , as you can see from this clever sign , and to sea level rise , and to storm surge , as you can see from the subway flooding .
there are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
and you ca n't get more alien than the dolphin .
this was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard .
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .
they imitated on their own .
( music ) she discovers a note she likes , finds the octave .
vint cerf : ( laughs ) ( laughter ) ng : speaking as one .
and we were happy with ourselves .
forty years ago , bob kahn and i did the design of the internet .
thirty years ago , we turned it on .
just last year , we turned on the production internet .
what that means is that what we 're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
jc : right , and then on a practical level , which technologies are you looking at first ?
dr : thank you . vc : thank you .
i 'd like to tell you about two games of chess .
it 's a sexy vision , for sure . many have embraced it .
foldit , a game created by computer scientists , illustrates the value of the approach .
non-technical , non-biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein , allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues .
foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the mason-pfizer monkey virus .
a protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game .
in fact , this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability .
for example , terrorism . terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances , and despite what you might see on tv , these adaptations , and the detection of them , are fundamentally human .
`` there is no `` '' find terrorist '' '' button , and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems , the less effective data mining can be . ''
they found a treasure trove of documents : 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters .
the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper , to explore non-obvious hypotheses , and in fact , insights emerged .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
january and february are the dry months in haiti , yet many of the camps had developed standing water .
we 're more than 50 years into licklider 's vision for the future , and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century 's hardest problems , man and machine in cooperation together .
the other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around , and that 's not true either .
now , the way that we 're approaching this problem to try to understand the mechanisms of concussion and to figure out if we can prevent it is we are using a device like this .
it has sensors in it that are essentially the same that are in your cell phone : accelerometers , gyroscopes , and when someone is struck in the head , it can tell you how their head moved at a thousand samples per second .
but you get the idea .
so we collaborate with svein kleiven 's group in sweden .
and so the red is 50 percent .
and we think that this might be one of the most common mechanisms of concussion , and as the forces move down , they strike the corpus callosum , it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion .
this stuntman does not have a helmet .
and this device is for sale in europe but is not for sale in the us , and probably wo n't be any time soon .
there are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons .
it can save your life , but it 's not sufficient , i would say .
similarly , it 's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not ?
they 're not regulated by the government , anyway .
so she 's a year and a half old , and she 's already , well , wants to anyway , race down the streets of san francisco .
what about the links connecting twitter , google and protesters fighting for democracy ?
today , conflict is essentially borderless .
# jesuischarlie .
and this turned into a weapon .
for answers to these questions , it starts with individuals , and i think peer-to-peer security is the answer .
technical ability is rising around the world , and individuals and small groups have the advantage .
i mean , it 's crucified .
basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat .
and for good reason .
so no gavage , no force feeding , no factory-like conditions , no cruelty .
and they 've been doing it quietly ever since .
as he said to me , that really pissed the french off .
i read about it . it was in le monde .
he should n't win because it 's not foie gras .
it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage .
that is , until i went to eduardo 's farm in extremadura , 50 miles north of seville , right on the portugal border .
he repeated that about 50 times in the two days i was with him .
( laughter ) and when i was speaking to him , you know , i thought , like i 'm speaking to you now , right , but sort of in the middle of my questions , my excited questions , because the more i got to know him and his system , the more exciting this whole idea became .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
i 've never seen it . have you ?
extra hard land , right ?
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .
but he never controls it .
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen .
and like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they 're called back — and they 're called back and back and back .
they find it here .
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras , he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing my hair out .
it 's like , why did n't i follow up on that ?
the history of foie gras .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
whether we 're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras .
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage , and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person .
and you know what ? it worked .
one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease .
he 's examining these holes , and now he 's got it already .
that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way , and there 's few people remaining with parasites , that the dogs can find these people , we can treat them with anti-malarial drugs , and give the final blow to malaria .
it 's a crazy story , but i believe it 's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever .
here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that i 'm just about to release . ( laughter ) just kidding , just kidding .
here we go .
so cheese , dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos .
but that 's not the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard anyone say about my work .
there 's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people , and all of these devices now , it 's standard that they communicate wirelessly , and i think this is great , but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing , and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning , there 's a lot of danger in this .
i 'm going to show you a few different targets like this , and that 's my talk . so we 'll look at automobiles .
think about it . when a car receives a radio signal , it 's processed by software .
the way that the researchers did this work is , they read the software in the computer chips that were in the car , and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did , and then they found vulnerabilities in that software , and then they built exploits to exploit those .
the first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got access to the internal network on the car .
the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular , or something like that , never having actually gotten physical access to your car .
all of these were implemented successfully .
how would you steal a car in this model ?
surveillance was really interesting .
they videotaped people on a bus , and then they post-processed the video .
motorola makes the most widely used one , and you can see that they 're used by secret service , they 're used in combat , it 's a very , very common standard in the u.s. and elsewhere .
so , would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency ?
this is plain text . this is encrypted .
well , they found the names and information about confidential informants . they found information that was being recorded in wiretaps , a bunch of crimes that were being discussed , sensitive information .
now , we 've all looked at smartphones upside down .
a human 's not going to think it 's the supreme might .
and so , together we 're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer .
there 's several other notable attacks that unfortunately i do n't have time to go into , but the one that i wanted to point out was a group from the university of michigan which was able to take voting machines , the sequoia avc edge dres that were going to be used in new jersey in the election that were left in a hallway , and put pac-man on it .
so they ran the pac-man game .
what does this all mean ?
what we can do is be aware that devices can be compromised , and anything that has software in it is going to be vulnerable . it 's going to have bugs .
compassion has many faces .
`` a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , `` '' love and compassion are necessities . ''
`` and i remembered a line from the mahabharata , the great indian epic : `` what is the most wondrous thing in the world , yudhisthira ? '' ''
i watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
and he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes .
they touched me at that time .
and it was really her strength , i believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
but that is not enough , because compassion , which activates the motor cortex , means that we aspire , we actually aspire to transform suffering .
and if we 're so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
but the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
i had that condition , to a certain extent , from my own childhood illness .
and in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities .
for example : a person who is cultivating compassion , when they are in the presence of suffering , they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do .
however , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration .
jody williams called it : it 's good to meditate .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm out of here . '' '' he 's going down the path . ''
he looks , it 's a dog , he drops to his knees .
and at that moment , the dog transformed into the buddha of love and kindness .
thank you .
i do n't even know why they make me slow down , but something pulls me like a magnet and then i ignore all the others , and i just go to that painting .
why not apply that to our looking at paintings ?
but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing , and that is the look on her face , the conflicted look on her face .
the daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting .
we do n't know very much about vermeer , but the little bits that we do know , one thing we know is that he married a catholic woman , they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he — his studio . he also had 11 children .
and he decides to paint her .
so those are not her pearl earrings . whose are they ?
she 's in the studio with him for a long time .
`` and that lack of resolution , the lack of resolution in `` '' girl with a pearl earring '' '' — we do n't know if she 's happy or sad . ''
this painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons : one is the disconnection between his mouth that 's smiling and his eyes that are wistful .
i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he 's thinking about ?
and i thought , well , henry viii , okay .
he 'd be preoccupied with his inheritance , with his heir .
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune ?
now , here 's the story .
he managed to make the word tender .
despite drinking steadily all afternoon , he was still pale .
`` `` '' congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james . ''
`` i 'm sure you 'll be content together . '' '' he never used my nickname again . ''
she is a 69-year-old nun .
and when i met him , he was a kind gentle old man .
so i snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the dalai lama , and i would hand them out .
and they live up on the chang tang , the tibetan plateau , way in the western part of the country .
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible .
they could hear things , smell things , see things i could n't see .
but around the world , they go into trance in different ways , and in pakistan , the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal , pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke .
you know , getting kids used to different realities , i think , is so important . what dan dennett said the other day — having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to make a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems — i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
and all the security issues they cause us .
so our dream is to bring teenagers together , so they 'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience , as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
so your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles .
i had a really hard time in school .
`` it ruined my life — ( laughter ) `` '' the inconvenient truth '' '' and mr . gore . ''
it has an intact hindu culture .
i know it does n't look like a school , but it is something we decided to do , and it is extremely , extremely green .
our children spend 181 days going to school in a box .
the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials .
and when the natural breeze is n't enough , the kids deploy bubbles , but not the kind of bubbles you know .
so we basically turned the box into a bubble .
and you know what these are .
these are compost toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
there 's an amazing river traveling through it , and you can see there how we manage to get across the river .
the mothers are n't quite convinced .
and how did we do all this ?
on giant grass .
it 's bamboo .
the yellow box was called the administration complex .
it 's a double helix .
`` and the problem of building it — when the balinese workers saw long reams of plans , they looked at them and said , `` '' what 's this ? '' '' so we built big models . ''
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world , but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful .
you ruined my life , but you gave me an incredible future .
i 've been simplifying things for 30 years .
my focus is understanding you people , and how you interact with the government to get your benefits , how you interact with corporations to decide whom you 're going to do business with , and how you view brands .
how about that ? do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
at such and such a date , ibm has responsibilities , you have responsibilities .
received very favorably by business .
make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
( applause )
we included heterosexual couples , where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm , and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere .
i wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family .
and they could take a paper apple for everyone who , in their view , was a member of the family , write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted .
at this point , none of the children started mentioning the donor .
i think he should be in the trunk , because he made my family possible .
one couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows .
and that fear is understandable , because we live in a very heteronormative and geneticized society — a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom , one dad and their genetically related children .
`` when i have a question , i just go and ask her . '' '' clever guy . ''
it should be advice that there is evidence for — evidence that it actually improves patients ' lives .
now , if you get a ph.d. , and you decide not to teach , you do n't always end up in a place like this .
so i did it : i found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps .
then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit because we were credit-worthy at that point .
everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise .
50 companies signed up , 200 products came out , generated 100 million in sales .
it failed .
because the people who were gathering brazil nuts were n't the same people who were cutting the forests .
we needed to be working on soy — things that we were not focused on .
`` he said , `` '' you ca n't wake a person who 's pretending to sleep . '' '' ( laughter ) okay . fast forward . ''
we know the limits of the resources we have .
we may be able to use them differently .
there 's a basic equation that we ca n't get away from .
`` population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it 's a simple `` '' not equal . '' '' our work shows that we 're living at about 1.3 planets . ''
if we were farmers , we 'd be eating our seed .
this is where we stand today .
so when the average american consumes 43 times as much as the average african , we 've got to think that consumption is an issue .
but it 's not just about people ; it 's about lifestyles .
you think that 's not an issue going forward ?
let 's go back and visit our equation .
they were consuming what they were consuming — let 's say one unit of consumption each .
they 're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do — scientists , again , agree — because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today — on global average , about [ 2.9 ] .
but we 've also got to get consumption down .
and then we need to consume less .
should you be able to buy a product that 's sustainable sitting next to one that is n't , or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable ?
the average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the u.s .
from a greenhouse gas perspective , is lamb produced in the u.k .
`` in every single case , the answer is `` '' it depends . '' '' it depends on who produced it and how , in every single instance . ''
we need oxford to work with cambridge .
we looked at the threats to these places .
are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
companies can push producers faster than consumers can .
it 's risk and demand .
for the big companies , it 's reputational risk , but more importantly , they do n't care what the price of commodities is .
if cargill makes a decision , the entire palm oil industry moves , or at least 40 or 50 percent of it .
it turns out mars buys more seafood than walmart because of pet food .
if you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid , the farmer did n't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities .
( applause )
and that moved us to the next level .
it 's , sort of , like if you ask people , well , what is a megabyte or megabit ? and what is broadband ?
people never want to say , i really do n't understand .
and you would , you know , when you think about it , four letters , or the representation of four things , makes us work .
everything that happens in digital is converted , or a representation , of a one and a zero .
so , if you look at a human genome , they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs . that 's a lot .
when you get sick , it is a bug in your genome .
all those side effects , you know , oily residue and , you know , whatever they say in those commercials : forget about that .
we can understand functionality . this is really important .
not only does it do that ; if you took the genome — that synthetic genome — and you plugged it into a different critter , like yeast , you now turn that yeast into mycoplasma .
they have discovered pathways that create flavors , although it 's very important to understand that those compounds that it 's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome , in our tongue , for us to understand and interpret those flavors .
they 've also discovered that there 's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well .
they 've identified areas of vulnerability to disease .
so , we could , you know , focus on disease resistance ; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it , or costs .
our ocean 's teaming with microbes ; in fact , when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water .
we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do , which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere .
we all talk about terroir ; we worship terroir ; we say , wow , is my terroir great ! it 's so special .
well , you know , we really , we argue and debate about it — we say it 's climate , it 's soil , it 's this . well , guess what ?
they 're easy to sequence : unlike a human , they , you know , have a thousand , two thousand genes ; we can figure out what they are .
they 're here . they 're in the universe .
so , what 's happening today is , nature is presenting us with a toolbox , and we find that this toolbox is very extensive .
nature will not allow you to — we could engineer a grape plant , but guess what .
we ca n't make the grape plant produce babies .
i just ask the question , if you could cure all disease — if you could make disease go away , because we understand how it actually works , if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious , healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments , if we could create clean and plentiful energy — we , right in the labs at synthetic genomics , have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline .
i 'm showing you two works , one on the right by leon golub , one on the left by robert colescott .
in some cases , i know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues , you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation .
think about the place that artists can play in that — that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that i work towards , in working with young , black artists .
the space in which now , in my project of discovery , of thinking about artists , of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century .
this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now , at this point in history , to see art as a catalyst ; what it means now , at this point in history , as we define and redefine culture , black culture specifically in my case , but culture generally .
it is why i look to art .
now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
so , what do i discover when i look at artworks ?
just flash it , scare the guy . he 's a punk .
i am told every day , by every face i see , every wall i face , that i am wrong .
then can you tell me what wrong is ?
no , do n't just give me an example .
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
`` so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , `` '' i do n't know . ''
so why do n't we have a good theory of brains ?
it can attack . it can do all kinds of stuff .
well , i do n't know what you 're thinking , but i 'm talking about the beards . ( laughter ) and no matter how long i 've spent on the ocean , i have n't yet managed to muster a decent beard , and i hope that it remains that way .
i feel like i 've got a purpose in this life , and i do n't know what it is , but i 'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it .
i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary , the one that i wanted , a life of adventure , and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice , normal , pleasant life , but it was n't where i wanted to be by the end of my life .
oars are your only means of propulsion .
i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom .
there were so many times when i thought i 'd hit that limit , but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy .
and eventually after 103 days at sea , i arrived in antigua .
no i do n't . i 'm totally self-supporting out there .
and finally : am i crazy ?
so , how do you top rowing across the atlantic ?
i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps .
i do n't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we 've cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
the first attempt did n't go so well .
in 2007 , i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours .
we had a bit of a battle of wills .
awful , really awful .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
but what do you do ?
powered by my solar panels , it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater .
they 'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone , and they were starting to sink .
so they 'd had to pull in and do all the lids up .
they were running out of food ; i was running out of water .
and , the following year , set out on the second stage of the pacific , from hawaii down to tarawa .
i had a meeting with the president there , who told me about his exit strategy for his country .
and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
so even though i did n't grow any taller , i did n't sprout a beard , something had changed : my interior dialogue had changed .
at the moment , the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff , that we need oil .
but what about if we just change that story ?
we do have alternatives , and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives , those sustainable ones , to create a greener future .
and , by the same token , we can turn that tide .
it 's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we 've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
so , shortly , i 'm going to be launching a new initiative called eco-heroes .
i was 21 .
countless women , men and children have been raped , tortured or enslaved .
( beatboxing ) ( beatboxing ends ) ( laughter ) ( beatboxing ) np : pops , pops , pops , pops , pops , pops , hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up !
np : where it came from .
then you would see a rapper , and when the rapper began to rap , we would do a simple beat , because back then the beats were simple — ( beatboxing ) or — ( beatboxing ) those were simple beats .
or we 'll be in the kitchen cooking , road trips , airports .
in his dreams , he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the earth .
`` in french , it 's sometimes called `` maladie de l'emmuré vivant . '' ''
`` last week , i was brought so low , but i felt the hand of my father around me , and my father brought me back . '' '' when we were n't his voice , we were his legs and arms . ''
the heart pumps .
a toddler has no attitude in its being , but a man insists on his world every day .
it 's called the social stress test .
and normally , we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we are n't coping very well with the pressure .
and we just did a little intervention .
it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
it 's a natural anti-inflammatory .
and when you choose to view stress in this way , you 're not just getting better at stress , you 're actually making a pretty profound statement .
they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do .
but then , when i took the first bite , i broke down in tears .
and it was the healing , motherly touch of an untouchable woman .
( applause ) chris anderson : for many years , you 've been an inspiration to others .
and i know that 10 years ago , if i had told you that this was all coming , you would have said that that 's impossible .
that was the model . that was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming .
first of all , it was impossible , and it 's not what it was .
and there 's 55 trillion links between all the web pages of the world .
it 's just a huge machine , and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .
so i did something else . i figured out 100 billion clicks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain .
but to a first approximation , the size of this machine is the size — and its complexity , kind of — to your brain .
i have three kind of general things i would like to say , three consequences of this .
first , that basically what this machine is doing is embodying .
and thirdly , we 're going to become completely codependent upon it .
these are all basically portals into that one machine .
there 's many things about it . it becomes very simple , and basically what you 're doing is you 're just touching the machine , you 're touching the cloud and you 're going to compute that way .
and everything will go through the web .
they 're going through the machine .
and the other thing about this embodiment is that there 's kind of what i call the mcluhan reversal .
and that 's what we called the net ; that was the internet of nets .
and if you remember , it was a kind of green screen with cursors , and there was really not much to do , and if you wanted to connect it , you connected it from one computer to another computer .
it was n't like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
the second stage that we 're in now is the idea of linking pages .
i 'm calling it the one machine . but we 're linking data .
why should you be doing that ? you should just do that once , and it should know who all your friends are .
all this data about you should just be conveyed , and you should do it once and that 's all that should happen .
so you have to be open to having your data shared , which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page , or your computer .
but when six billion humans are googling , who 's searching who ? it goes both ways .
but we can also think about it as kind of a large organism .
but there 's a unity of some sort that 's starting to emerge .
you want to make something that the machine can read .
i want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea .
now i bet , in this audience , you 're thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i have n't even heard of , i 'm absolutely sure .
but i 'm also sure , pretty sure , that absolutely nobody is thinking of this .
in this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
and this is the reason : in two countries that had n't had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
hundreds of people were paralyzed .
but the message was very clear .
it 's been tried six times in the last century , and it 's been successful exactly once .
even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
this is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years .
last year , it was 1,000 .
and then , in one of the most important , tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world , we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have .
and now they 've even started using these devices — speaking of cool technology — these little devices , little gis trackers like this , which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators .
this is the kind of commitment now we 're seeing to try and reach all of the children we 've been missing .
and we did n't start with the easy places .
so this morning at about seven o'clock , i decided that we 'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again , so that you could see something that 's just unfolding today , which proves that the impossible is possible .
and in the last six months , we 've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history .
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .
help us tell the story .
they 're going to be the tough ones .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
but right now we do n't have enough of that .
in the '30s an airplane had two wings and a round motor , and was always flown by a guy who looked like cary grant .
he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter , devil-may-care saunter , flick the cigarette away , grab the girl waiting here , give her a kiss .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal .
you had to learn about aeronautics .
you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .
and of course , as a model in those years , you could n't control it .
i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
i wanted to get back where the romance was .
and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them .
and that 's the way i work now .
now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
there are drawbacks to this .
they begin to fall off the end of your chart .
the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
and they go up easily .
and stop where you want .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .
and that 's a lot of load .
at the same time , as i say , you open up this joint .
so here we are .
but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position .
and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people .
in the life that only i see , who i am , who i really am , is someone who struggles intensely with depression .
but that 's sadness . that 's a natural thing .
that 's a natural human emotion .
real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
and to be totally honest , that 's hard for me to stand up here and say .
but for me , for a large part of my life , i feared myself .
i feared my truth , i feared my honesty , i feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner , like i was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so i thought about that way every single day .
it 's the stigma inside of others , it 's the shame , it 's the embarrassment , it 's the disapproving look on a friend 's face , it 's the whispers in the hallway that you 're weak , it 's the comments that you 're crazy .
well , it wo n't . it has n't , and it 's not going to , because that 's wishful thinking , and wishful thinking is n't a game plan , it 's procrastination , and we ca n't procrastinate on something this important .
but right now , depression is society 's deep cut that we 're content to put a band-aid over and pretend it 's not there .
because the world i believe in is one where embracing your light does n't mean ignoring your dark .
`` the world i believe in is one where i can look someone in the eye and say , `` '' i 'm going through hell , '' '' and they can look back at me and go , `` '' me too , '' '' and that 's okay , and it 's okay because depression is okay . we 're people . ''
we 're people , and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry , and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness , then i 'm here to tell you you 're wrong .
we 're people , and we have problems .
she and her baby were presumed dead .
`` `` '' am i too late ? ''
soap operas teach us to push away doubt and believe in our capacity for bravery , vulnerability , adaptability and resilience .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' all my children '' '' 's erica kane was daytime 's version of scarlett o'hara , a hyperbolically self-important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring . ''
`` i am erica kane and you are a filthy beast ! '' '' ( laughter ) and of course the bear left , so what that teaches us is obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight . ''
now , lots of companies fold at that point , but tim chose to fight .
he maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still was n't enough .
julia , her books and her tv shows revolutionized the way america cooks .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) in 1983 , `` '' days of our lives '' '' ' stefano dimera died of a stroke , but not really , because in 1984 he died when his car plunged into the harbor , and yet he was back in 1985 with a brain tumor . ( laughter ) ''
and so it went for 30 years .
( applause )
i call them my terminal days .
`` you have six months or a year to live . '' '' and you start thinking about what you would do with this time . ''
so i said , i 'm going to do something else .
every monday and thursday , i 'm going use my terminal days .
and then when we finally have time , we have neither the money nor the health .
instead of going mountain climbing when you 're 82 , why do n't you do it next week ?
we 'd go out and try and recruit people and we 'd say , look , when you come to us , we 're not going to have two or three interviews and then you 're going to be married to us for life .
so , come have your interviews .
spend an afternoon , spend a whole day , talk to anybody you want .
we had , at one point , 14 different offices around town , and we 'd say , go to the one that 's closest to your house , to the customer that you 're going to visit today .
so as we started finding that this worked , and we 'd say , we 're looking for — and this is , i think , the main thing i was looking for in the terminal days and in the company , which is , how do you set up for wisdom ?
do n't create a problem for us , for manufacturing , for application , then we have to buy new companies , we have to buy our competitors , we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets .
( laughter ) and so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting , which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties .
and we looked at that and we said , we have to start much earlier .
so we set up a foundation , which now has , for 11 years , three schools , where we started asking the same questions , how do you redesign school for wisdom ?
one guy , we 'll call a tutor .
so there 's a place for math and physics and all that there .
so we need a thread in school that talks about everything we do n't know .
we 'd say , why do we have to scold the kids and say , sit down and come here and do that , and so forth .
you ca n't .
so this is lost and that 's what we try to do there , which is looking for wisdom in that school .
when i was 50 , my wife fernanda and i sat for a whole afternoon , we had a big pit with fire , and i threw everything i had ever done into that fire .
this is a book in 38 languages , hundreds and hundreds of articles and dvds , everything there was .
i 've gone to the magnetic north pole on a dog sled .
so , we 've been busy .
we started three new companies in the last two years .
`` are there any times you 've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you 've gone , `` '' yes ! '' '' ? ''
and i 've never been very evangelical about these things .
we put it out there .
it 's something that will flourish on its own .
it seems to me that 's the fuel that 's driven a lot of this .
do you have any other questions for us , for ted , for this group here ?
`` we were sitting in a jacuzzi , and he said , `` '' dad , why do we exist ? '' '' there is no other question . ''
ricardo semler , thank you so much .
the next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex .
and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point .
`` ( laughter ) and i started to make him walk across the table , and i thought , `` '' oh , i can make a little machine that will do that . '' '' so , i made this device , linked it up , and the wishbone walks . ''
( laughter ) that 's about that big .
and — so the way i saw this in my mind at first , was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed , and the pieces would move far out , and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel , to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center .
( laughter ) because it could run all the time . ( laughter )
`` and this one i call `` '' machine with grease . '' '' it 's just continually ejaculating , and it 's — ( laughter ) — this is a happy machine , i 'll tell you . ( laughter ) ''
so this is a little wire-bending tool .
my life completely changed when i found a spot welder .
i just like , throw it in .
when i moved to boston , i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society .
i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings , but they popped up when i least expected it .
`` `` '' one does not put sugar in green tea . '' '' `` `` i understand , '' '' i said , `` '' that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i 'd like to put some sugar in my green tea . '' '' ( laughter ) surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager . ''
this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice .
( laughter ) but from the japanese perspective , it 's their duty to protect those who do n't know any better — ( laughter ) in this case , the ignorant gaijin — from making the wrong choice .
i 'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them .
`` it 's called `` '' being true to yourself . '' '' but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ? ''
now when the third group came in , they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers .
such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed .
it did n't matter who did the choosing , if the task was dictated by another , their performance suffered .
the second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like this .
during the very first session , which was run in russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard .
`` americans train their whole lives to play `` '' spot the difference . '' '' they practice this from such an early age that they 've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability . ''
we all have physical , mental and emotional ( laughter ) limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the grocery store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
right outside chicago , a young couple , susan and daniel mitchell , were about to have their first baby .
in all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
we wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
even up to a year later , american parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their french counterparts .
this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving , whatever gives us a new way to see , can not be communicated to those who speak a different language .
`` but joseph brodsky said that , `` '' it is poetry that is gained in translation , '' '' suggesting that translation can be a creative , transformative act . ''
it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice , to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but does n't always deliver .
`` what 's different about them ? '' '' and they said , `` '' well , one is elegant , the other one 's glamorous . '' '' okay , we got that . ''
`` and i brought women into the laboratory , and i asked them , `` '' which one would you pick ? '' '' 50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles . ''
( applause )
after some success , we 've hit a big hurdle .
my question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions .
she has two loving parents , one of whom is standing right here .
if i tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty , you get a sense of the ambition .
the number of people living on less than $ 1.25 a day has halved .
but a lot remains to be done in two years .
one in eight remain hungry .
`` to which i get the classic four-year-old response : `` why not ? '' ''
something about that exchange stuck with me , not because of the look of relief on pia 's face when i finally finished , but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply , a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis .
but the amount created was unprecedented .
secondly , inflation simply never became a threat .
brilliant .
so following that conversation with my daughter , and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing , and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time , this made me wonder : could we match but just on a much grander scale ?
`` let 's call this scheme `` '' print aid . '' '' and here 's how it might work . ''
well , this involves the creation of money to buy goods , not assets .
today , money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool .
everybody was blaming everybody else .
they blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
that complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it : levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of britain at a level that i have never seen before in my lifetime .
and second , what can we do about it ?
but those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation .
they represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject .
the specter of brexit is in all of our societies .
so the question i think we need to ask is my second question , which is how should we collectively respond ?
that vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization .
but the same survey also revealed huge public misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration .
the second thing that i think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities .
they did n't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world .
furthermore , if we 're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them .
and what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization , a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics , and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding .
only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization .
i was a surgical resident at the johns hopkins hospital , taking emergency call .
that was n't being asked .
now , looking back on that night , i 'd love so desperately to believe that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i 'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the e.r . three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer .
why did i feel justified in judging her ?
i 'd like to say i do n't know .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , i 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
now your blood sugar levels start to rise , and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease , cancer , even alzheimer 's disease , and amputations , just like that woman a few years earlier .
more importantly , i do n't have insulin resistance .
but most important , i was left with these three burning questions that would n't go away : how did this happen to me if i was supposedly doing everything right ?
what if obesity is n't the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
so for many of us , about 75 million americans , the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat , not the reverse , getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat .
how much better would we be if we treated the cause — telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room — rather than the effect ?
we know that 30 million obese americans in the united states do n't have insulin resistance .
i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but i 'm wide open to others .
it 's more likely too much glucose : blood sugar .
now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there 's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
first , how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism , hormones and enzymes , and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms ?
and finally , once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet , how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception ?
if you 're watching this now , i hope you can forgive me .
on a long space journey , you simply would n't be able to pick up any carbon along the way , so you 'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board .
so we said , well , earth is actually like a spaceship .
palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods .
and why might we need a sustainable agriculture ?
there are a number of reasons why .
we have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock .
let me give you a specific example .
just think of all of the species , the diversity , that was removed in the process , whether plant life , insects or animal life .
in those ecosystems , they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems .
so this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread , cakes , nutritional items of many sorts .
for example , think about something as simple as beer .
some people , we told them it was cheap .
and the expensive pain medication worked better .
think for a second , have a real number in your mind .
you have it ?
we asked people in england , australia , the u.s. — very similar answers .
we even asked different departments of a university .
how do we take these things and actually do something about it ?
to summarize , i would say , next time you go to drink beer or wine , first of all , think about , what is it in your experience that is real , and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations ?
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool , i take off from wisconsin and move to kansas , small town kansas , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small-town , rural kansas school district , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system .
i did n't tell them what to do or how to do it .
i posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community .
i had to just sit and watch .
it was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves , what they 're willing to share .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
my students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill .
and this is the work of the student that consistently did it .
there are a million pictures that i could click through here , and had to choose carefully — this is one of my favorites — of students learning , of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information , but instead , ask them what they can do with it .
ask them really interesting questions .
i have founded , cofounded or funded over 30 companies across a range of industries .
if the trend continues , the top one percent will share over 30 percent of national [ income ] in another 30 years , while the bottom 50 percent of americans will share just six .
you show me a highly unequal society , and i will show you a police state or an uprising .
what i am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately self-defeating .
it rewards people for solving other people 's problems .
but this maximizing participation thing does n't happen by accident .
`` june 19 , 2013 , bloomberg published an article i wrote called `` the capitalist’s case for a $ 15 minimum wage . '' ''
because there 's some contravening evidence .
since 1980 , the wages of ceos in our country have gone from about 30 times the median wage to 500 times .
and yet , seattle is the fastest-growing big city in the country .
when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants , that 's not bad for the restaurant business .
is it more complicated than i 'm making out ?
of course it is .
let 's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives , but also that the more people we include , both as entrepreneurs and as customers , the better it works .
let 's by all means shrink the size of government , but not by slashing the poverty programs , but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually do n't need those programs .
today , we have trickle-down economics .
thank you .
i 'll bet you did n't even know you 're using african technology .
it 's a bit like a huge jumping jack , and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater .
all the places with lots of electricity , it is n't .
because we have real problems .
in africa , we 've been doing that for years , and we 've been doing it on phones like this .
it works on every single phone possible , because it uses sms .
you can pay bills with it , you can buy your groceries , you can pay your kids ' school fees , and i 'm told you can even bribe customs officials .
( laughter ) something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through m-pesa .
so we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via m-pesa , which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age .
the gold of today is mobile , and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible .
really simple , using a basic phone .
i believe we are the gold .
( laughter ) this is not that catchy catchphrase .
it was a transformation like no other .
in other words , 0.025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism .
you can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton , you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory , and they are dying to form cartilage .
can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma ?
could that stop some of the degeneration ?
could you patent an environment ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
but we need new models to think about medicine in the future .
that 's what 's at stake .
so , if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way , we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies , and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies , and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .
i 'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird molotov cocktails .
everybody means everybody , means everybody here .
we are 12 billion light years from the edge .
women can talk ; black men ski ; white men build strong buildings ; we build strong suns .
when all the little mockingbirds fly away , they 're going to sound like the last four days .
`` i 'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads , with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing , `` '' hush , little baby , do n't say a word . ''
thank you , ted .
and so , for once , for the only time in my life , i was finally in the mainstream .
`` and it is an arresting fact that right across the board , in every single one of the major world faiths , compassion — the ability to feel with the other in the way we 've been thinking about this evening — is not only the test of any true religiosity , it is also what will bring us into the presence of what jews , christians and muslims call `` '' god '' '' or the `` '' divine . '' '' it is compassion , says the buddha , which brings you to nirvana . ''
`` and it was — the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called `` '' ren , '' '' human-heartedness , which was a transcendent experience in itself . ''
and now , here 's my wish : i wish that you would help with the creation , launch and propagation of a charter for compassion , crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three abrahamic traditions of judaism , christianity and islam , and based on the fundamental principle of the golden rule .
we need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos , and to give guidelines . this charter would not be a massive document .
i 'd like to see it — to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures , these texts that are being abused . remember what the rabbis and what augustine said about how scripture should be governed by the principle of charity .
we basically eliminated it .
`` it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , `` '' here is my cake . '' '' no , it was somebody else 's cake , as if you bought it in the store . ''
what i can tell you is this : that the rwandan genocide was one of the world 's greatest failures of simple compassion .
and not just to tears , but to actually stop the genocide .
she had to watch her youngest son , peter , suffer from malnutrition , as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness .
and so i 'd like to share a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle .
but first , let me begin with what you probably already know .
if you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day , it turns out that virtually the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when i was in high school , are still stuck there , 35 years later .
days before we met her , while she was walking home from church with her family , in broad daylight , men from her community just snatched her off the street , and violently raped her .
in fact , half a century of anti-poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history .
we 've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal .
the problem is not that the poor do n't get laws , it 's that they do n't get law enforcement .
dispatcher : i do n't have anybody to send out there .
he 's broken in before , busted down my door , assaulted me .
dispatcher : uh-huh .
and yet , for some reason , this is okay for poor people .
indeed , private security forces in the developing world are now , four , five and seven times larger than the public police force .
in africa , the largest employer on the continent now is private security .
almost all criminal justice systems , they start out broken and corrupt , but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment .
gary haugen .
however , i 've had the pleasure of being invited to come here to talk about water .
that 's why i 'm here , although i 'm carrying my head over here .
i hope this story will inspire you and that you 'll spread the word .
`` the amazon is the `` '' lung of the world , '' '' because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere . ''
there 'll be no music in my presentation , but i hope you 'll all notice the music of the reality i 'm going to show you .
if we take a look at this other image , which shows the water vapor flow , you have dry air in black , moist air in gray , and clouds in white .
do you know how much that is ?
there is a new type of river , which originates in the blue sea , which flows through the green ocean — it not only flows , but it is also pumped by the green ocean — and then it falls on our land .
all our economy , that quadrangle , 70 percent of south america 's gdp comes from that area .
we are floating here on this floating hotel , on one of the largest rivers on earth , the negro river .
here it is , pulsing .
scientists study how it works , why , etc .
this satellite image was taken one month ago — that 's manaus down there , we 're down there — and it shows this process .
i have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories .
we did n't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up .
we could understand it here , though .
if we could establish forests in those other areas , we can reverse climate change , including global warming .
she does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems .
having closed this quick introduction , we see the reality that we have out here , which is drought , this climate change , things that we already knew .
i 'd like to tell you a short story .
let 's start with the amazon !
he believes , with veneration and reverence , in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him .
but go and look at what is in there .
it is a live carpet .
let 's then look at the morpho butterfly , an example of an invisible technological competence of life , which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet , and let 's zoom in on it . again , hubble is there .
all of this on a tiny scale .
and we are not aware of it .
i am , of course , referring to none other than elvis presley .
she is not she , but a buttercup .
what we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
sexually unattractive people leave us cold .
third step is cognitive dissonance .
that 's a hypothetical example of course .
`` ralph waldo emerson described language as `` '' fossil poetry . '' '' but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor . ''
`` that 's routinely translated as , `` '' i think , therefore i am . '' '' but there is a better translation . ''
the mind is a plastic snow dome , the most beautiful , most interesting , and most itself , when , as elvis put it , it 's all shook up .
thank you very much .
and i 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if i have time still , an epilogue .
this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wildlife conservation society , which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world .
( laughter ) it was once a beach . and this painting has john james audubon , the painter , sitting on the rock .
and this is city hall park .
so the city basically extended to city hall park .
this is the collect pond , which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first 200 years , and for the native americans for thousands of years before that .
we can calculate the aspect .
you can think of these as neighborhoods , as distinctive as tribeca and the upper east side and inwood — that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities , the beaches .
and 55 is a lot . on a per-area basis , manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than yosemite does , than yellowstone , than amboseli .
`` so , we would read in field guides , the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves , you know , what beavers need is , `` '' a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows , near the water . '' '' that 's the best thing for a beaver . ''
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs .
and it need beavers to create the wetlands , and maybe some other things .
so if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th , and lex and third , maybe there was a stream in that block .
you can see this for yourself on our website .
we would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities .
so that we would actually take a photograph , flying above times square , looking toward the hudson river , waiting for hudson to come .
using this technology , we can make these fantastic georeferenced views .
so these images are the work of my friend and colleague , mark boyer , who is here in the audience today .
( applause ) there is such power in bringing science and visualization together , that we can create images like this , perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass .
`` in fact , that i see them as reflections of each other , much as lewis carroll did in `` '' through the looking glass . '' '' we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time , that they really are the same place , that there is no way that cities can escape from nature . ''
well , what if we go to madison square park , and we imagine it without all the cars , and bicycles instead and large forests , and streams instead of sewers and storm drains ?
we 've looked at our government oversight .
and the idea is a simple , simple idea , which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .
the consumer is empowered .
if you 're a mom trying to manage a budget , and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer , and it 's somewhere between 50 and 70 , do you plan vacations ? how do you buy ?
this was world war ii . do you know why savings was so high ?
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years .
this is an absolutely staggering chart .
but i read this fact the other day , that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years , so if you think about that , the context , the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here , and trillion there , we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage .
they are taking responsibility .
but that 's not really the whole story .
if you take into account 80 percent of all americans were born after world war ii , this is essentially our depression .
vasectomies are up 48 percent , according to the cornell institute .
and what i mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption . right ?
we also see just a relaxing of ego , and sort of a dismantling of artifice .
this is a story on the yacht club that 's all basically blue collar .
zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost .
again , this theme is about variable cost , variable living .
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values .
increasingly , consumers are looking at the culture of the company , looking for their conduct in the marketplace .
`` we also see the phenomenon — some of you may have `` '' boomerang kids '' '' — these are `` '' boomerang alumni , '' '' where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs , sharing skills and retraining . ''
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .
we 're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon , not a sprint .
that includes cottages and the like . but 30 percent .
and then we look at the high line in new york city , an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand new park in new york city .
another great example is fidelity .
so , in that respect , cooperative consumerism has really taken off .
well , they have a lot , because it 's their network of people . right ?
where j & j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers , allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect .
so , when we look at this and we step back , what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real .
it will make longer-lasting products . it will create better , more intuitive customer service .
and i 've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world .
i needed to head towards conservation goals .
so where are the phoenix islands ?
it 's out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
seamounts are important for biodiversity .
you can see the fish are balled up and then there 's a little cloudy area there where they 're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction — events that the ocean is supposed to do , but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity .
the phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries , especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .
so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever , but they did finally come to an end .
they control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet .
`` and when i was first going up there , i barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , `` why are you going to this place called kiribati ? '' ''
sea levels are rising , and kiribati , along with 42 other nations in the world , will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean .
we as a world are faced with a problem .
but back to the phoenix islands , which is the subject of this talk .
and , you know , it did n't seem like a very good deal to me .
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued , and it turned out there were none .
one is , remember i 'm a politician , so you 've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of kiribati that this is a good idea .
they realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community .
and that 's the story with climate-change heating .
and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .
you can read them yourselves .
that 's what i 'd like to share with you .
i 'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize .
( first voice ) ( second voice ) you probably did n't understand what they said , but i hope that you heard their unique vocal identities .
so what i wanted to do next is , i wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them , voices that could be customized for them .
dr. bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis , and what he 'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre-recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them .
these are people who had lost their voice later in life .
so we decided to do exactly that .
so when i realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity , i had this idea .
it 's not such an ominous thing .
i love to sleep .
the more speech you have , the better sounding voice you 're going to have .
this is samantha .
now there 's millions of people around the world like samantha , millions , and we 've only begun to scratch the surface .
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
about five years ago , we built our very first voice for a little boy named william .
a few days later , his shoulder started to hurt .
the fever climbed and climbed .
he was 30 years old .
and because bacteria can pass their dna to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport , once we have encouraged that resistance into existence , there is no knowing where it will spread .
we need those new drugs badly , and we need incentives : discovery grants , extended patents , prizes , to lure other companies into making antibiotics again .
we could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
thank you very much .
radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education .
and the world did n't stop in the 1990s .
and once hotly contested , our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard .
a lot of potential of young children is wasted .
these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all , a very important lesson .
last but not least , koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop .
very disappointing results .
the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education .
and the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity .
or take korea , at the other end of the spectrum .
in the year 2000 , korea did already very well , but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence .
and , of course , the question is , can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere ?
would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer ?
they realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents , and they personalize learning opportunities .
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
the goal of the past was standardization and compliance .
it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent .
and then i 'll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more — hopefully convince you — that i believe that in today 's world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful .
and would tell me a little bit about history too , when he 'd play the 1812 overture by tchaikovsky on this little victrola , and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times and why this music , in some way , represented a little bit of that history .
now , i do n't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids , but if you do , please trust me , it 's the most pressure you can put on a child , to say — ( laughter ) — we trust you that you will always do the right thing .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
so , when you look at that , we said , well , we would like to , then , enable that a little bit . we would like to create an initiative .
the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase .
i had the opportunity to have a discussion with president mbeki , and one of the things that we talked about is , what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster ?
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
it is still , in most places , a gray or black box , and it looks the same .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
it 's a country of 45 million people . it 's an economy that 's emerging .
the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on amd technology ; it 's a microprocessor .
`` and therefore , this is your opportunity to do better than my generation . '' '' frankly , i do n't know that i really understood what he told me at the time . ''
i was eager to go off to college , and go find girls , and study , and girls , and study , but then i finished college and i fell in love .
`` and on my wedding day , my father came to me again and said , `` '' you know , i 'm going to remind you again , that each generation has to do better than the last one . ''
i also thought , 80,000 relatives , do i want that ?
here i am alone in my office , but i 'm not alone at all .
here 's my cousin gwyneth paltrow .
now , i 'm not boasting , because all of you have famous people and historical figures in your tree , because we are all connected , and 75 million may seem like a lot , but in a few years , it 's quite likely we will have a family tree with all , almost all , seven billion people on earth .
`` he 's uncle albert . ( laughter ) and my son wanted to know , `` what did he say ? what is e = mc squared ? '' ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) so i want to make that clear . sorry , honey .
they are our great-great-great-great-great-great — continue that for about 7,000 times — grandparents , and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well , and estimates vary , but probably the farthest cousin you have on earth is about a 50th cousin .
now the final one is number five , a democratizing effect .
so it 's really a fascinating time in the history of family , because it 's changing so fast .
and then i liberate myself from these fears .
if i can do this for myself , you can do it for you .
you know the knife and the pistols and the bullets , i exchange into love and trust .
`` we did n't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say , you know , `` '' this is over . '' '' we walked the great wall of china to say goodbye . ''
`` and one very important piece i made in those days was `` '' balkan baroque . '' '' and this was the time of the balkan wars , and i wanted to create some very strong , charismatic image , something that could serve for any war at any time , because the balkan wars are now finished , but there 's always some war , somewhere . ''
and i sit everyday , eight hours — the opening of the museum — and 10 hours on friday when the museum is open 10 hours , and i never move .
and what happened ?
there was so much pain and loneliness , there 's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else 's eyes , because in the gaze with that total stranger , that you never even say one word — everything happened .
in sleeping , you 're still receiving art .
counting rice will be another thing .
we are always doing things we like in our life .
because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us , is to start with yourself .
but what we do on the personal level — what is our contribution to this whole thing ?
and just look a complete stranger in your eyes , in his eyes .
what about the late 1940s , when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms ?
so i created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits — the constellation of traits — linked with each of these four brain systems .
we have natural patterns of mate choice .
you did n't have the opportunity to choose between 1,000 people on a dating site .
`` and 81 percent said , `` '' yes . '' '' in fact , the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology . ''
women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
these are gone .
thank you .
as you know , there 's another speaker here with us that works in your same field .
esther perel : it 's interesting , because on the one hand , the need for love is ubiquitous and universal .
one is icing and simmering , which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries .
does it at some point begin to change — if the meaning changes , does it change the need , or is the need clear of the entire context ?
but it 's interesting , the millennials actually want to be very good parents , whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused on being a good parent .
how do i handle this there ?
five years ago , i was a ph.d. student living two lives .
although i was a satellite engineer , i had n't thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
the pictures that i was finding were years out of date , and because of that , it had relatively little relevance to the work that i was doing today .
now as aerospace engineering grad students , this chart cried out to us as a challenge .
was n't there a way to build a smaller , simpler , new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging ?
this was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites .
and i ca n't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things , but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset , of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy , of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found , it just seemed boring to go work on anything else .
what came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible , basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb .
traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner , similar to a xerox machine , and as they traverse the earth , they take pictures , scanning row by row by row to build the complete image .
so instead , we turned to a new generation of video sensors , originally created for use in night vision goggles .
today , it 's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks .
so why do all of this ? why build these satellites ?
i like to get past the fur , the feathers and the scales .
when i use my camera , i drop my skin like the animals at that cave so i can show who they really are .
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
we needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life .
roberto d'angelo : as you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
and that has been really a tough time .
questions , some basics , like , you know , why did this happen to us ?
i mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
we restarted from our strengths , and at the same time we restarted from his strengths .
this short video is from last week .
and this is why — ( applause ) — and this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him .
are they going to be around in 50 years ?
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics , where you put a pc on , and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff .
and then there 's a higher price point sort of robot toys — the sony aibo . and on the right there , is one that the nec developed , the papero , which i do n't think they 're going to release .
reporter : ... battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks .
rodney brooks : can we have another one of these ?
there 's a sea change happening in how — where technology 's going .
come over here . now notice , he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff .
`` did people see the movie `` '' ai '' '' ? ( audience : yes . ) rb : yeah , it was really bad , but — remember , especially when haley joel osment , the little robot , looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it ? ''
rb : now , here they 're asked to prohibit the robot , and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner .
when we talk to someone , we talk .
ritchie : yeah , look , it 's got a little blue light in it too . i almost lost it this week .
( laughter ) so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs .
if we are machines , then in principle at least , we should be able to build machines out of other stuff , which are just as alive as we are .
we 'll — you know , they 're not going to have a super bad robot .
i am the exception .
my husband is a business owner .
we are magic .
`` aristotle called happiness `` '' the chief good , '' '' the end towards which all other things aim . ''
a few years ago , i came up with a way to study people 's happiness moment to moment as they 're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world , something we 'd never been able to do before . called trackyourhappiness.org , it uses the iphone to monitor people 's happiness in real time .
on the other hand , when our minds wander , they 're unconstrained . we ca n't change the physical reality in front of us , but we can go anywhere in our minds .
as it turns out , people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they 're not .
as it turns out , there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later , consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy .
this shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — ( laughter ) — when people are taking a shower , brushing their teeth , to 50 percent when they 're working , to 40 percent when they 're exercising , all the way down to this one short bar on the right that i think some of you are probably laughing at .
what do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11.5 million documents , verify it and make sense of it ?
the reason journalists are scared of technology is this : the profession 's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news .
in all , reporters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries — from the bbc in britain to le monde newspaper in france to the asahi shimbun in japan .
so you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do .
and on april 3 this year , at exactly 8pm german time , we published simultaneously in 76 countries .
and there were some unintended consequences .
the technology — the internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself .
`` so i had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down , a bit like a general , where you 're holding your troops back : `` calm , remain calm . '' ''
but the basic information such as the name of a person , what their offshore company was and the name of that company , is now all available online .
`` she does n't feel good about what happened , but she thinks , `` '' maybe this is just what sex in college is ? '' '' one in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the united states . ''
but when she sees mike taking girls home from parties , she 's worried about them .
but with such low reporting rates , it 's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported , much less anything happen if they are .
you see , knowing that you were n't the only one changes everything .
if a system like this had existed for hannah and her peers , it 's more likely that they would have reported , that they would have been believed , and that mike would have been kicked off campus , gone to jail , or at least gotten the help that he needed .
we do n't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it .
and it 's used for communication .
they had no stone tools .
but there are a lot of similarities .
so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo .
he 's a bonobo .
and she came to us when she was just at puberty , about six or seven years of age .
and now we see all four .
slim-bodied , bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
none of them are tricks .
ss : an entire family at our research centre .
good .
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
you can get it out .
video : you 're happy .
( laughter ) like us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
his name is nyota .
in the wild , the parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring .
subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
video : now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
ss ( video ) : very nice . beautiful , panbanisha .
( laughter ) researcher : ok , now get the monsters . get them .
take the cherries too .
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild .
so there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us , but with immediate latent value to someone else .
my passion , and what i 've spent the last few years dedicated to researching , is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems .
we now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face , but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before .
i mean , it 's amazing to think that , in every single minute of this speech , 25 hours of youtube video will be loaded .
and four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
these four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift — away from the 20th century , defined by hyper-consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
i generally believe we 're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors — through sites such as flickr and twitter that are becoming second nature online — are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives .
the second is collaborative lifestyles .
`` i bet , in a couple of years , that phrases like `` '' coworking '' '' and `` '' couchsurfing '' '' and `` '' time banks '' '' are going to become a part of everyday vernacular . ''
and that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to — how many of you have a power drill , own a power drill ? right .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
so when you consider these two facts , it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright .
it 's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise .
`` there 's a great quote that was written in the new york times that said , `` '' sharing is to ownership what the ipod is to the 8-track , what solar power is to the coal mine . '' '' i believe also , our generation , our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation . ''
but now with the web , we leave a trail .
let 's go back to my first example , swaptree .
in other words , i can trust him or her .
now as a closing thought , i believe we 're actually in a period where we 're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste , and we 're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity .
i 'm on a mission to make sharing hip .
because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business , help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough .
it 's called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
and what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object , visually sight the target , because they 're in the plexiglas cone of the bomber , and then they plug in the altitude of the plane , the speed of the plane , the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target .
`` and as norden famously says , `` '' before that bombsight came along , bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more . '' '' but he said , with the mark 15 norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . ''
and to put that in perspective , the total cost of the manhattan project was three billion dollars .
half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .
well , it turns out it 's not the holy grail .
and not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer .
so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
but most of all , the norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target .
but of course , what happens in real life ?
it needs cloudless sky to be really accurate .
so in the 1930s , he hired a whole bunch of them , including a man named hermann long who , in 1938 , gave a complete set of the plans for the norden bombsight to the nazis .
so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war — which also , by the way , did n't work very well .
if you go into the military , you 'll find lots of carl nordens as well .
oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
the issue was they did n't know where the scud launchers were .
it 's the drone . what is the drone ?
we think we 're now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that 's a little bit crazy .
it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
so pivot , this application — i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it — and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
my whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
i was at a crossroads .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the waist down .
they 'd have to operate .
if i could n't do that , then what could i do ?
i remember one night , one of the nurses came in , jonathan , with a whole lot of plastic straws .
`` gone . '' '' and the question i asked was , `` '' why me ? why me ? '' '' and then i remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly maria . ''
i knew it would be challenging , but it was actually a blessing , because maria always smiled .
and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do , in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom .
`` they said , `` '' you know , when do you want to come out ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i ca n't drive . sort of ca n't walk either . ''
`` i said , `` '' hi , i 'm here for a flying lesson . '' '' and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws . ''
and i took the controls , and i was flying .
and little goals kept me going along the way , and eventually i got my private pilot 's license , and then i learned to navigate , and i flew my friends around australia .
and then i got my commercial pilot 's license .
he finds some clothes and gets dressed .
and as he glances out the window , he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of 60 from across the street .
they could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other .
take 59 away from 60 , and you’re left with the one .
there’d be a paper princess kate but we’d all stare at paper pippa , and then we’d all live in fear of killer jack the paper-ripper , because the paper propaganda propagates the people 's prejudices , papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists .
but that’s when little miss sunshine came along singing her favorite song about how we’re made to be strong , and you don’t have to be wrong to belong , just be true to who you are , because we are all stars at heart .
`` this animal is in `` '' the guinness world book of records '' '' for being the world 's heaviest bony fish . ''
it reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds — on a diet of jellyfish , primarily .
and i think it 's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola — its common name is sunfish — that its favorite food is the moon jelly .
now this is typically how you see sunfish , this is where they get their common name .
they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared , 65 million years ago , at a time when whales still had legs , and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction — oblige me a little kipling-esque storytelling here .
that 's a little diver up there in the corner .
how do you do that with an animal — very few places in the world .
and it can record this data for up to two years , and keep it in that tag , release at a pre-programmed time , float to the surface , upload all that data , that whole travelogue , to satellite , which relays it directly to our computers , and we 've got that whole dataset . and we did n't even have — we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know , sat at our desks .
i think donne wrote a poem about that .
and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment .
and under those kelps — this is why the molas come there because it 's spa time for the molas there .
and they 're not thrown back as by-catch , they 're eaten .
we were served a nine-course meal of mola after we tagged .
they 're not big migrators . this is their track : we deployed the tag off of tokyo , and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there .
and this is a day in the life of a mola , and if we — they 're up and down , and up and down , and up and down , and up and up and down , up to 40 times a day .
as the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their dive .
virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place .
on the upside , the man that i worshipped as a child , the man that i wanted to become as an adult , i was finally able to get his autograph .
`` and here 's one of the early experiments : ( music ) so this is called `` '' the wilderness downtown . '' '' it was a collaboration with arcade fire . ''
unfortunately , talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture .
and she and her family fled syria through the desert into jordan and she 's been living in this camp for the last year and a half .
i am 12 years old .
and because of that , you feel her humanity in a deeper way .
so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos in january .
and these are people who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in jordan .
and that 's where i think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion — 10 to the 21st — molecules of isoprene .
and because it 's so much stuff , it 's really important for the atmospheric system .
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening .
we found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there .
this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .
and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .
the winter was very harsh , and unfortunately , naghma 's brother died and her mother became very ill .
in desperation , her father went to a neighbor to borrow 2,500 dollars .
after several months of waiting , the neighbor became very impatient , and he demanded that he be paid back .
now , stories like naghma 's unfortunately are all too common , and from the comforts of our home , we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women 's rights .
however , afghanistan does have a legal system , and while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs , even in jirgas , laws are supposed to be followed , and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral , it 's illegal .
and within these conversations , i started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people , and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused , while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused .
protecting naghma and her right to be free protects us .
matt rosenberg is a journalist in afghanistan .
two weeks ago , afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president ashraf ghani , which is huge , and i 'm very optimistic about him , and i 'm hopeful that he 'll give afghanistan the changes that it needs , especially within the legal sector .
child marriages prolong the vicious cycle of poverty , poor health , lack of education .
i 'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to afghanistan , but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy .
thank you .
he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades .
i 'll give you an idea .
and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades and he went sailing , every summer , back and forth from lebanon , where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo , and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms .
maybe there is a link , a commercial link , between one organization and another one .
but it was only when i interviewed mario moretti , the head of the red brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro , italian former prime minister , that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
naturally , nobody wanted to fund my research .
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
and there are three main stages .
the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
and here is the best example , the contras in nicaragua , created by the cia , legally funded by the u.s. congress , illegally funded by the reagan administration via covert operation , for example , the iran-contra affair .
and the ira , which control the private transportation system in northern ireland , did exactly the same thing .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
so , this was a vital injection of cash into the u.s. economy .
so , when i went to look at those figures , i noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states , never to come back .
these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers .
the united states actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world .
the u.s. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
`` all the bankers said to their clients , `` get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else . '' ''
people simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the united states into europe .
and it was introduced only for the u.s. dollars .
( laughter ) and that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .
in order to talk about cancer , i 'm going to actually have to — let me get the big slide here .
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer .
`` i can make them healthy . '' '' and there probably are special cases of that . ''
so the list of ingredients does tell you something , and sometimes it tells you something that 's wrong .
and so it 's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct .
so this happens in physics all the time .
so this great triumph — it 's so good , there 's almost a religious experience in biology .
and so by reading the genome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know .
and then one day , i get a call from john doerr , bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call .
`` ( laughter ) so i was like , `` '' okay . this guy 's at least resourceful . '' '' ( laughter ) so we started talking , and he said , `` '' i really need a better way to measure proteins . '' '' i 'm like , `` '' looked at that . been there . ''
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we do n't know what 's going on inside of them .
basically , what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient , and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh , how slippery they are , and we arrange them in an image .
and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein .
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
`` so what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that responded to a drug and one that did n't respond to a drug , and ask , `` '' what 's going on differently inside of them ? '' '' and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences . ''
so what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose — that is , put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis — and that works great for infectious diseases .
we know that that works .
well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body — you know , where did it appear ? — and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body .
`` whereas living room water , it 's better to do tar on the roof . '' '' and it sounds silly , but that 's basically what we do . ''
there will be many teams like our team that work on this .
we 're concerned in the national security community , and of course in the biology community and the public health community .
it 's one of the most lethal things we 've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries .
two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus , which made the species range broaden dramatically .
it 's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic .
you 've heard about the vaccine we 're stockpiling .
for example , all masks are made in china .
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis .
we had evolution over time , and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings : 55 percent of people who have become infected with h5n1 have , in fact , succumbed .
and you 'll have massive competition .
germany did that when h5n1 appeared in germany last year , in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats , dogs and so on .
these are in hong kong ; we have nothing like that here .
during the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help .
in the sars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly .
we do n't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders , the people who will actually be there on the front lines .
the second wave was the mutated , super-killer wave .
and in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers .
as a nation , no we 're not .
what mask works , what mask does n't work .
otherwise you 're in trouble .
( applause ) audience member : what factors determine the duration of a pandemic ?
clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates , and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity , and finds other hosts .
it 's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with , you had a weakened immune system , you lived in poverty in india or africa , your likelihood of dying was far greater .
and it wo n't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells do n't recognize it either .
i think the human race does n't have a future if it does n't go into space .
we took off from the shuttle landing facility , where the shuttle takes off and lands .
we are living on a precious jewel , and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend 's homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings , where a drink often cost more than what they 'd paid their 14-year-old maid .
paradoxically , when i let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment .
i invite you into three recent stories of mine , which are about this way of looking , if you will , which i believe exemplify the tenets of what i like to call compassion in storytelling .
in 2007 i went to liberia , where a group of my friends and i did an independent , self-funded film , still in progress , on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named general butt naked .
he got his name from fighting stark naked .
and he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on earth today .
during this expedition i expected him to be killed outright , and us as well .
he begs for forgiveness , and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered .
senegalese , the young man seated on the wheelchair here , was once a child soldier , under the general 's command , until he disobeyed orders , and the general shot off both his legs .
he forgives the general in this image .
in this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him .
where does such rage come from ?
focus on what 's dignified , courageous and beautiful , and it grows . thank you .
or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
and i feel like i 've just got started .
but when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
and there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience .
it is the criteria .
and the reason was that i have never , never seen the names of my sisters written on any document .
and this was not only she , only malala .
i imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well .
i taught my girls , i taught my girl students , to unlearn the lesson of obedience .
dear brothers and sisters , we were striving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society .
it was a doomsday for my family and for me .
the world turned into a big black hole .
`` i 'll be okay . please do n't worry . '' '' she was a solace for us , and she consoled us . ''
thank you very much .
hi quincy . hi maestro zander . hi mark .
we can speak only with music .
we hope to have , our maestro , to have orchestras in all the countries in all americas .
and we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of america .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
it sent me over mass . ave. , massachusetts avenue , the shortest route from boston to cambridge .
but after a month that i was cycling every day on the car-packed mass . ave. , i took a different route one day .
now let me ask you : am i alone here ?
however , the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination .
well , if you think that adventure is dangerous , try routine . it 's deadly .
edi , edi .
audiences marveled at the way they moved .
they were illusions , a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer 's art .
now , this goes both ways .
technology can do the same .
edi : a computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing it was human .
mt : we anthropomorphize our machines .
mt : we let them entertain us .
( music ) thank you .
one of the things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine , that lovely caslon type , and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context .
here i 'm one person talking to you .
you 're all collective . you all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh .
in general , that seems like a funny cartoon , but let 's look what online survey i did .
`` ( laughter ) `` i do n't want to hurt them . that does n't seem very funny to me . '' ''
to people like this , i point out we use anesthetic ink .
now , we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles .
matt diffee is one of them .
what is it , the cartoon ? is it really about lemmings ?
basically , that 's the way humor works .
there are the people , fops up there , but everybody is laughing , everybody is laughing except one guy .
overdrawn . underdrawn .
for god 's sake no , a thousand times no .
eh , no .
office worker : grilled cheese ? bm : no .
office worker : black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard ? bm : no .
within that context , we feel it 's okay .
there is no such thing as funny in and of itself .
it 's like this , like an amusement park .
it 's called dispositional humor .
you have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference , and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon .
`` that 's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called `` '' i do n't get it : the new yorker cartoon i.q . test . '' '' ( laughter ) the other thing the new yorker plays around with is incongruity , and incongruity , i 've shown you , is sort of the basis of humor . ''
something that 's completely normal or logical is n't going to be funny .
now that 's a little puzzling , right ? it does n't quite come together .
but for us , and for me , helping design the humor , it does n't make any sense to compare one to the other .
so i want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon , and i think this sums up the whole thing , really , about the new yorker cartoons .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia . there are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as nepal , indonesia and columbia .
the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
yes , acute in montana . toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars .
and i would expect that , if our human civilization carries on , then maybe in the next century people will be asking , why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?
so , that 's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions : conflicts of interest .
but today , their commitment to a british identity is serving australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in asia . so it 's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength .
the last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word .
many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
you know , from healthcare to transportation , everything is different , but education has n't changed .
now , i really believe that we can transform education , both in quality and scale and access , through technology .
so at edx and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through moocs to really increase access to education .
this number is bigger than the total number of alumni of mit in its 150-year history .
7,200 students passed the course , and this was a hard course .
7,200 is also a big number .
`` `` hmm . '' ''
but our kids are really different .
so here 's what we can do .
two high school teachers at the sant high school in mongolia had flipped their classroom , and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises , where the learners in the high school , 15-year-olds , mind you , would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class , and as you see from this image here , they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work .
with this blended class late last year , the failure rate fell to nine percent .
now before we go too far into this , i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas .
they can hit the pause button .
the third idea that we have is instant feedback .
so with instant feedback , students can try to apply answers .
you know , they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it .
i told my tas , okay , 24/7 , we 're going to be up monitoring the forum , answering questions .
had popped in with a different answer .
otherwise , how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and , you know , you did n't even have a rewind button ?
i 'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like — and i 'll come back to that theme a few times — instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .
and this is just the same .
we 've come a long way since then .
but before doing that , what i 'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you .
if the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early-onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease — things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat .
how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
this is age versus cost of health care .
and you can actually — ( laughter ) — we wo n't get into that . ( laughter )
we diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years .
why could n't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?
so today 's reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .
and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work .
therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing .
if we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself .
( laughter ) however , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish — even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends — the lights are down . this is a good time to look at your feet , check your blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen . ( laughter )
so i 'm going to put the slide up now . it wo n't be up for long .
the horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident .
he chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .
and if you look really carefully , it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back-flush .
( laughter ) it 's a great source of stem cells .
so you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
and if there 's anything that 's been learned about burn , it 's that we do n't know how to treat it .
it 's no coincidence .
the european union , same thing .
myself and jay vacanti from harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he 's going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients .
language is kind of exclusive to our species , anyway .
i am free from judgment , and so i can do whatever i want , you know ?
so a while after my dad was diagnosed , i was having coffee with my friend andrew lo .
he 's the head of the laboratory for financial engineering at mit , where i also have a position , and we were talking about cancer .
and andrew had been doing his own bits of research , and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the literature was that there 's actually a big bottleneck .
what i 'm going to tell you about is some work we 've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done .
so in order to get started , let me tell you how you get a drug financed .
so now here 's a question : if i were to ask you , for example , to make a one-time investment of , say , 200 million dollars to buy one of those bottles , so 200 million dollars up front , one time , to buy one of those bottles , i wo n't tell you which one it is , and in 10 years , i 'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones .
`` what if we start thinking about them as financial assets ? '' '' they 've got really weird payoff structures and all that , but let 's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them . ''
so that was the theory , and we talked about it for a bit , we did a bunch of experiments , and then we said , let 's really try to test it .
that 's a hundred thousand billion .
it was the first time that the people who could actually make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations .
because , again , i 'm not a scientist .
( laughter ) so for the last 20 years , i 've been studying how children learn to tell lies .
at four years of age , more than 80 percent lie .
so now , let 's take a closer look at the younger children .
why do some but not all young children lie ?
so if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie , instead of being alarmed , you should celebrate — ( laughter ) because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development .
now , are children poor liars ?
`` in the videos , the children are going to respond to a researcher 's question , `` did you peek ? '' ''
so if your accuracy is around 50 percent , it means you are a terrible detector of children 's lies .
now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers , who work with children on a daily basis ?
no , they can not .
let me illustrate this with my own son , nathan .
( laughter ) this is the real pinocchio effect .
( laughter ) for example , during a debate .
we can even use it in dating .
the first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none , and that 's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults , and there are very , very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children .
it 'll sound corny , but it 's sincere .
i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for darius , and for me to be told that there might be other dariuses who are not getting treatment , that 's just viscerally wrong .
so , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the '60s , are now being applied to human children .
that 's the humanitarian mission .
and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .
so , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , i launched project prakash .
prakash , as many of you know , is the sanskrit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience .
and the logo — even though it looks extremely irish , it 's actually derived from the indian symbol of diya , an earthen lamp .
( text : such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children , and ...
( applause ) thank you .
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
i should add a tragic postscript to this — she died two years ago in a bus accident .
so , the way we study that is , let 's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .
interestingly enough , you give them a few months , and this is what happens .
this one is a circle , and this is a square .
this simple idea has far reaching implications .
when we saw that , we asked : could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been .
the red dots are the children we have not treated .
and for my students and i , it 's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research , while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with .
and so that gives me an opportunity , because every design show that i curate kind of looks at a different world . and it 's great , because it seems like every time i change jobs .
and that 's because there 's some little bit of fear , little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms .
elasticity of mind is something that we really need , you know , we really need , we really cherish and we really work on .
and before i launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview , i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design .
in australia they did it — this research company , called symbiotica .
but the problem is that it 's a really ugly patty .
rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are , i think , bound to change the world . you 've heard about it before many times .
it used to be called rapid prototyping , rapid modeling .
techniques became better — not only carving but also stereolithography and laser — solidifying all kinds of resins , whether in powder or in liquid form . and the vats became bigger , to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing .
they had a particular shape that they had to stay in .
so , various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays .
they 're still very useful .
these three objects over there are hard drives with a bluetooth connection . but they 're in reality very , very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away .
`` and this is even better . this is auger-loizeau , `` '' afterlife . '' '' it 's the idea that some people do n't believe in an afterlife . ''
but i 'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going — which is always , hopefully , a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going .
from a meteorite from space , we’re over here with an original sputnik .
and it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back , on apollo 11 .
and it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a guttenberg bible .
they traveled all around europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .
that is why the printing press succeeded , and that is why martin luther nailed his 90 theses to the door : because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .
you’re going to find out why in a minute , because when i went to see eileen , this is what i said i wanted to build .
it’s designed like an escher print .
and eileen and i are thrilled to open our home and share it with the ted community .
none of us really have ever seen one , but we know it exists because we’ve been taught to understand this molecule .
but we can also look at an enigma machine from the nazis in world war ii that was a coding and decoding machine .
well , this is the code for life , and this is a code for death .
what that means is , a 200-megabyte file looks like this , ladies and gentlemen . ok ?
( applause )
i 'm turning 44 next month , and i have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year , a year of fulfillment , realization .
`` `` twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations , '' `` sixty-two , ... of subtle diminishments . '' ''
now the list is done : a hundred years .
i still have my life to live , still have many more pages to pass into .
and mindful of mailer , i await 44 .
instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
if you will indulge me , i will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they 've come to this belief .
this is not just about china building roads and ports and railways in her own country — she 's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in china and surpass that of the united states — but even if you look to places like africa , china has been able to help tar the distance of cape town to cairo , which is 9,000 miles , or three times the distance of new york to california .
i want to be able to do what china 's doing .
in particular , there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth .
instead of criticizing china for bad behavior , the west should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
in fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
as you leave here today , i would like to leave you with a very personal message , which is what it is that i believe we should be doing as individuals , and this is really about being open-minded , open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world , creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people , has to be based in being open-minded , because these systems have good things and they have bad things .
at the time of my birth , blacks were not issued birth certificates , and that law only changed in 1973 .
but also , it 's going to require that we look at our assumptions , assumptions and strictures that we 've grown up with around democracy , around private capitalism , around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms .
in particular , i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance .
so i went back to work , and i 've spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
and i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today .
`` now i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies — the `` '' abattoirs of the human soul , '' '' as i call them . ''
before i went back to work after my year at home , i sat down and i wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired to .
walk the dog .
do another three hours ' work .
( applause ) how often do you think i have that day ?
i truly understand how that can be daunting .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
`` i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's `` '' james and the giant peach . '' '' i then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , `` '' goodnight , mate , '' '' and walked out of his bedroom . ''
she did n't have much other information .
i called her back , and that 's when she told me that gabby had been shot in the head .
mk : yeah , with aphasia , gabby knows what she wants to say , she just ca n't get it out .
and she 's on a motor scooter there , but it 's my understanding that 's a very tame image of what gabby giffords was like growing up .
mk : well , when we met , oddly enough , it was the last time we were in vancouver , about 10 years ago . we met in vancouver , at the airport , on a trip that we were both taking to china , that i would actually , from my background , i would call it a boondoggle .
pm : after you got married , however , you continued very independent lives .
pm : i 'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way .
with a prosthetic , yeah , which is the whole side of her head .
pm : is that for appetizer or dessert , mark ?
mk : i imagine being grateful , too , right ?
mk : i think when something tragic happens in a family , it can pull people together .
pm : and of course , the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery , and yet , gabby , how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook ?
so far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing .
pm : thank you both for that effort .
( applause ) mk : let me just say one of the guys that gabby jumped with that day was a navy seal who she met in afghanistan who was injured in combat , had a really rough time .
gg : yes .
because this is the ted stage , gabby , i know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience .
i 'm working hard , lots of therapy — speech therapy , physical therapy , and yoga too .
i want you guys to imagine that you 're a soldier running through the battlefield .
unfortunately , by the time that a medic actually gets to you , what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more , with the application of pressure , to stop that type of bleed .
now , this problem is not only a huge problem for the military , but it 's also a huge problem that 's epidemic throughout the entire medical field , which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body ?
teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools .
i mean , you may have a dog .
no . i think there 's a population of around five million in finland .
they may find it boring .
anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
now invariably , you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
penile diversity is especially profuse .
( laughter ) mm-hm . ( laughter ) so with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
now the female actually gets the last laugh , though , because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries .
earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones .
so we 've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner .
i mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
so it may not be surprising to any of you that animals , including ourselves , spend a good amount of time thinking about sex , but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it .
how could this have gone by like lightning ?
and i had kept in good shape , but swimming 's a whole different animal .
are your shoulders ready ?
was the mind ready ?
and i had all kinds of counting systems ready there in english , followed by german , followed by spanish , followed by french .
and i was on fire — excruciating , excruciating pain .
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
they drag him out on the boat , and he 's — evidently , i did n't see any of this — but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out .
and they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board .
as a matter of fact , the best advice i got was from an elementary school class in the caribbean .
i finished the swim like this .
and i want to live every day of the rest of my life that way , swim or no swim .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
( applause )
and so , what after that ?
but i 'm ready .
anyway , i wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design , at least from my small aperture of the world .
then this is a mcnugget maker , i think .
next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff .
that paid the rent for about a month .
that 's my youngest cousin .
my career basically peaked here .
and in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who could n't make it to the show .
and i 'm really not very good at it .
you can actually see the steadicam with a bubble on the bottom .
( video ) i 'm getting dizzy ...
throughout this whole thing , making toys , i think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science .
there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows , you know , to find innovation .
and those three together , i think , give you leverage in the world .
but moving on .
all right , there 's that robot again .
and so i 've always had a big interest in this .
and this is a — you know , the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear .
what 's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form ?
i get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together .
`` so my wife says , `` '' well , you may like it , but nobody else will . '' '' so she comes to the rescue . ''
and she does drawings , right ?
he did n't test so well , but i like him .
there 's my favorite , demon furby .
`` and hasbro actually said , i meant tiger electronics at the time , said , `` '' yeah , we want to do this . ''
and then they looked like little garfields there .
and it 's , of course , for your kids .
`` we did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the internet , won `` '' best innovations '' '' at ces , but really i kind of slowed down and said , ok , i just ... after a while , i had this old tape of this dinosaur , and i gave it to this guy , and this other guy saw it , and then people started to want to do it . ''
not a robot that kind of does , but let 's really go for it .
and so we actually went in .
very , very obsessive .
there 's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton , but the geometry 's correct .
there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue .
there 's some solid works versions of it .
they have seven processors , they have 14 motors , they have — but you do n't care , do you ?
they 're just cute , right ? that 's the idea , that 's the idea .
( laughter ) there you go .
we — actually , it 's very hard to keep people from doing this .
but you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together .
and trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull .
and you have some guy that you 're not quite sure what 's wrong with him — oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future .
these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries .
anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate .
anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment , to start to delve deeper into the body .
surgeons did n't have a problem with respectability anymore ; they had become gods .
you 've got these long instruments , and you 're working off your centerline .
and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist .
i talked about the large , complicated robot .
and in fact if you , or anyone you know , had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years , chances are it was done with one of these systems .
so what 's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology , this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere .
we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site .
but you care about nerves , if you are a surgical patient .
and when you get to that point — i mean , these maladies do n't care how many books you 've written , how many companies you 've started , that nobel prize you have yet to win , how much time you planned to spend with your children .
these maladies come for us all .
and the prospect i 'm offering you , of an easier surgery ...
i 'm not sure i really even want it to .
and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany .
what i want instead , is for you to be whole , intact , and functional enough to go out and save the world , after you 've decided you need to do it .
and that is my vision for your future .
let 's pretend right here we have a machine .
and i wonder what you 'd choose , because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
we 're on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
you 're not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you 're not .
`` so i wrote a story about that too , and i could n't understand why people thought this was `` '' frankenfoods , '' '' why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature 's ground . ''
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
do n't take anything for granted .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he ca n't testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
( laughter ) it 's okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
it 's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
( laughter ) that 's fantastic . i love big placebo .
`` and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , `` '' what do you care ? let people do what they want to do . ''
and some of it worked , and some of it did n't .
now we can do it in a more precise way — and there are risks , absolutely — but we can put something like vitamin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
i have to say , i do n't understand it .
yes , you 're right . let 's fix it .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
they would n't starve , and you know what ?
so i 'm on a mission to change that .
i want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences .
teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard , because these action units , they can be fast , they 're subtle , and they combine in many different ways .
as you can see , the algorithm has essentially found cloe 's face , so it 's this white bounding box , and it 's tracking the main feature points on her face , so her eyebrows , her eyes , her mouth and her nose .
it 's the largest emotion database in the world .
where is this data used today ?
as a little boy , and through my teenage years , i became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life .
so i turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger : the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems , the little things , as i like to say , who run the world .
in the last 30 years , thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology , biologists have , for example , added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species , to bring the current total to 5,400 , and more continue to pour in .
at this point i think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion .
but each of these species , even the tiniest prochlorococci , are masterpieces of evolution .
each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives , interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine .
i realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique , marvelous animals and plants on that island — and this is true of practically every part of the world — which took millions of years to evolve , are in the process of disappearing forever .
`` the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth 's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym `` '' hippo , '' '' the animal hippo . ''
i is for the invasive species like the fire ants , the zebra mussels , broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country , and at an exponential rate — that 's the i .
and the final letter is o , for over-harvesting — driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .
that 's in the united states .
so this brings me to my wish for tedsters , and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk .
but what excites me is that since i first put forward this particular idea in that form , science has advanced .
today , the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
i saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism , specifically visual journalism , can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies .
society 's problems ca n't be solved until they 're identified .
every story does not have to sell something .
i saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields , but right where people live .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
without the political will to find common ground , the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance , and perpetuates the cycle of violence .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
in 1994 , after three months of covering the south african election , i saw the inauguration of nelson mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing i 've ever seen .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
this man had just been liberated from a hutu death camp .
children with birth defects were labeled incurables , and confined for life to inhuman conditions .
going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .
an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust , and four out of five workers came down with cancer .
a malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program .
this experience raised a lot of questions , among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available .
a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family .
my ted wish : there 's a vital story that needs to be told , and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era .
( laughter ) gas , i 'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up .
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
they 're going to put in six new nuclear power stations , and probably more after that .
because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy .
nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
so , that 's that process there . deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 .
helium splits out , and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out .
and it 's this reaction that we want to do .
and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years , and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .
and we will have to extract uranium from sea water , which is the yellow line , to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us .
and breeder technology is fast breeders . and that 's pretty dangerous .
is it cost-competitive ?
more than half the world 's population is involved in building this device in southern france , which is a nice place to put an experiment .
we have to get to a power plant .
but at the moment , all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
i 'm going to go very , very quickly through this .
today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty , how best we release their energies .
on the one hand , we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out .
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .
and so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time , takes a lot of patience .
at the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide 's knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
we 're starting to see these happening all around the world .
lifespring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality , affordable maternal health care to low-income women , and it 's been so successful that it 's currently building a new hospital every 35 days .
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope .
and finally , at the end of the journey , i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon .
because that is where dignity really starts .
and there is so much good that we can do .
my fellow psychologists have shown that we 're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact .
rng : all on its own , the answer is no , but it does n't take much to switch it to yes .
sp : well , among other things , our circle of empathy expanded .
but with the expansion of literacy and travel , people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles , the clan , the tribe , the nation , the race , and perhaps eventually , all of humanity .
sp : but if empathy was n't enough to make us more humane , what else was there ?
rng : well , you did n't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels : reason .
reason has muscle .
rng : oh , they did . here 's the french theologian sebastian castellio making the case .
rng : no doubt , but modern anti-war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war , such as the father of modernity , erasmus .
erasmus : the advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide , and reach great numbers , while in war , if anything turns out happily , the advantage redounds only to a few , and those unworthy of reaping it .
the cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning .
in the 1960s , the civil rights movement inspired the movements for women 's rights , children 's rights , gay rights and even animal rights .
jeremy bentham : the question is not , can they reason , nor can they talk , but can they suffer ?
but what is the tendency of this example ?
to dispose others to engage in the same practices .
rng : i opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms .
sp : still , i have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future .
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , brainwashed , a terrorist .
i 'm an introvert .
the funny thing was , it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure i felt as a 17-year-old , to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty .
its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears .
have you ever felt like someone sees you , completely understands you and yet loves you anyway ?
and then that terrible morning of september , 2001 .
we moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world .
and i thought , we should just stay home .
it 's the accusations that are tough .
going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement .
and what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online , but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community , from even their family , so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they , the terrorists , are the true muslims , and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates .
but we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people .
how does it impact everyone else ?
so i am not in any way an exception .
i 'm a librarian , and what i 'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
it 's not easy to one-up the greeks . but with the industriousness of the egyptians , they were able to build the library of alexandria — the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world .
the problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it .
so if i 'm successful , then you 'll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that 's ever wanted to have access to it .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
then the question is , what do you get ?
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
in india , they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from silicon valley , fly them to uganda , buy a car , set up the first internet connection at the national library of uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in rural uganda .
something else i 'm quite excited about in this particular domain , beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little screens that are coming out .
you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily .
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
if it 's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize , ocr , package it up , make it so that you could download , print and bind it — the whole shebang — we would have achieved something .
so anyway — so we ended up making our own book scanner , and with two digital , high-grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum lighting , so even if it 's a black and white book , you can go and get the proper intonation .
the thing we 're missing is the 10 cents .
the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal .
but it is within our grasp , technologically and law-wise , at least for the out of print and out of copyright , we suggest , to be able to get the whole darn thing online .
now let 's go for audio , and i 'm going to go through these .
moving images : if you think of theatrical releases , there are not that many of them .
as best we can tell , there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution . it 's just not that many .
so we 've digitized those and made those available .
we only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9/11 , sort of from 9/11/2001 . for one week , what did the world see ?
cnn was saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets .
were they ? let 's look at the palestinian television and find out .
so anyway , television is , i would suggest , within our grasp .
and we 've made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
so we 've started to — we 've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alexandria .
there 's a political and social question out of this .
is all of this , as we go digital , is it going to be public or private ?
there 's some large companies that have seen this vision , that are doing large-scale digitization , but they 're locking up the public domain .
that 's a danger .
you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles .
healthcare is changing in the same way .
and it 's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful .
you 're flying through the cortex of my colleague 's brain .
our narrative here is real fmri data that 's mapped visually and sonically .
you view the bond in the triangle .
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom .
and they 're understanding more about quantum mathematics .
so these brief examples that i 've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we 're doing at the university of california , santa barbara , to bring together , arts , science and engineering into a new age of math , science and art .
last time , i talked about death and dying .
so they got very interested in producing convulsions , measured types of convulsions .
`` and they thought , `` '' well , we 've got electricity , we 'll plug somebody into the wall . ''
so they plugged him in again , and this time they used 110 volts for half a second .
so people would have a real grand mal seizure .
it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things .
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
i could hardly see five feet in front of myself .
i rarely bathed . i sometimes did n't shave . it was dreadful .
`` and she used to go nuts , every five minutes or so in the play , and he said to her , `` '' we must have a word to bring you back to reality , and the word , my dear , will be 'basingstoke . ' '' '' so every time she got a little nuts , he would say , `` '' basingstoke ! '' '' and she would say , `` '' basingstoke , it is . '' '' and she would be fine for a little while . ''
i brought my wife with me , actually , to make sure i could get through this .
i really have it figured out , so that i can advise people about death and dying , so that i can talk about mysticism and the human spirit .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
and it 's constructed for change . it 's all about change .
and of course it 's born stupid .
it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it , usually to the mouth .
and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands , potentially millions of ways .
by this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .
and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills .
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired .
or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound .
the input does n't really have to be meaningful .
this is required so the brain sets up it 's processing so that it can act differentially , so that it can act selectively , so that the creature that wears it , that carries it , can begin to operate on it in a selective way .
and it 's focusing on skill after skill , or ability after ability , under specific attentional control .
it 's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior .
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .
each attempt was substantially different from the other .
we can look down in the brain of the monkey .
we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain .
and that is indicated in the pink . we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
they are all remodeled . they all become specialized for the task at hand .
the brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context .
billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver , and that result in the embodiment of you .
you are constructed , your self is constructed from these billions of events .
it 's not japanese .
it 's crap .
it 's not english . it 's noisy english .
a way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .
you can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford , and mit , and ucsf , and ucla , and a number of other institutions .
now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging .
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers , because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale — and the same for kids .
get ready for it . it 's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future , just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period .
the other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself .
okay . thank you .
`` my job was to ask this question : `` what do the stories look like ? '' ''
because that is what knopf is .
the stories can be anything , and some of them are actually true .
they all need a face .
the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography .
genius !
now i took this diagram , and i put it in a photostat machine , ( laughter ) and i took a piece of tracing paper , and i taped it over the photostat with a piece of scotch tape — stop me if i 'm going too fast — ( laughter ) — and then i took a rapidograph pen — explain it to the youngsters — ( laughter ) and i just started to reconstitute the dinosaur .
and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .
we 're in the middle of the process .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and i was thrilled .
`` augusten burroughs wrote a memoir called [ `` '' dry '' '' ] , and it 's about his time in rehab . ''
this is going to be the opposite of that .
a book cover is a distillation .
but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf .
huhh ! and now the sultan is in danger .
try experiencing that on a kindle .
much is to be gained by ebooks : ease , convenience , portability .
do you know what john updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from alfred a. knopf ?
and the last story i 'm going to talk about is quite a story .
a woman named aomame in 1984 japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway . when she gets to the bottom , she ca n't help but feel that , all of a sudden , she 's entered a new reality that 's just slightly different from the one that she left , but very similar , but different .
and so , we 're talking about parallel planes of existence , sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers .
we 're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling , and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode .
`` for many , their existence , their humanity , has been reduced to statistics , coldly recorded as `` '' security incidents . '' '' for me , they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the '90s . ''
they live in me somehow , their memories giving me meaning every day .
when you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria — aid worker abducted , hostage executed — but who were they ?
we need to find better ways to remember them .
we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives .
my brain went on automatic , rewinding quickly the life i 'd just left behind .
i tried to pray , i tried all sorts of memorization games .
it 's a constant internal debate ; there is no one to arbitrate .
i insulted his mother , i insulted his ancestors .
i begged for my food .
the routine was always the same : a bit more light , 45 minutes .
`` so when ruslan came the day after , before he put the first question to me , i asked him , `` '' how is your son today ? is he feeling better ? '' '' ruslan was taken by surprise . ''
he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life .
and then he 'd talk about guns , about cars , about women , and i had to talk about guns , about cars , about women .
`` there , a guard came to me , very close — it was quite unusual — and he said with a very soft voice , he said , `` '' i 'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby dagestan . '' '' what could i possibly reply ? ''
he probably meant well .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
that 's a picture of me the day of my release .
humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or in post-conflict environments , yet our life , our job , is becoming increasingly life-threatening , and the sanctity of our life is fading .
2013 broke new records : 155 colleagues killed , 171 seriously wounded , 134 abducted .
this is inexcusable .
i do n't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me .
i do n't know what it is to lose the protection of my country .
how many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse ?
i do not forget my lost colleagues .
i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected .
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way .
that 's based on diet intake surveys , it 's based on levels of obesity , it 's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people 's mouths .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
two more we 're going to throw away directly into bins .
i was sitting in a roadside cafe .
`` how have i insulted my host ? '' '' he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl , and he said , `` '' clean . '' '' ( laughter ) i thought , `` '' my god , you know , i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food . ''
and yet , in europe , that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
`` can citizens influence and shape national and global policy ? '' '' i never thought i would ask myself these questions , but here i am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society movements that i 've been involved in . ''
most of them are young , black boys dying by guns .
but rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements , i just want to share with you four key insights .
but before i get you too excited , i do n't mean drugs should be a free-for-all .
after a very successful gun-collection program , we were elated .
during a televised 20-day public debate , our opponent used our own arguments against us .
the national rifle association — yes , the american nra — came to brazil .
they inundated our campaign with their propaganda , that as you know , links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy .
in fact , guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
drugs are cheaper and more available than ever , and consumption has risen globally .
it is true that some people have made these arguments before , but we 've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change .
the televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion .
in both the case of guns and drugs , we brought together a wonderful mix of people .
i mean it 's point and click , it 's like the menus , icons , it 's all the kind of same thing .
but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this , it 's actually heavier . so the lighter stuff does n't really move but if i throw it at the lighter guys , right ?
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop .
so i can pile things up , i can flip through it , i can , you know — okay , let 's move this photo to the back , let 's delete this guy here , and i think it 's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
i know what you 're thinking .
and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of english .
i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum , and no longer the sole domain of mother england , it has become a bandwagon for every english-speaking nation on earth .
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
well , i do n't think so .
`` `` '' but , '' '' i hear you say , `` '' what about the research ? ''
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite arbitrary .
so immediately , we 're rejecting them .
now i get it , i understand why people would want to focus on english .
they want to give their children the best chance in life .
my daughter came to england from kuwait .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
`` the voice asks , `` '' who is there ? '' '' he said , `` '' it is you , o heartbreaker . '' '' the door swings open , and the voice says , `` come in , for there is no room in this house for two i 's , '' — two capital i 's , not these eyes — `` '' for two egos . '' '' and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path . ''
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they 've done that , then they can do extra .
compassion on earth is given , it is in us .
and at that minute , you felt at one with the universe — one with that jug of water , one with every human being , one with the creator — and you felt you were in the presence of power , of awe , of the deepest love , the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives .
this is all you . and this is all us .
one is asking for angur — one is , say , an englishman — one is asking for eneb , and one is asking for grapes .
and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human .
for what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but god defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
thank you , and god bless you .
so when , a year later , turkey 's gezi protests happened , it started as a protest about a park being razed , but became an anti-authoritarian protest .
it was n't surprising that media also censored it , but it got a little ridiculous at times .
an angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture , and that one too went viral , and since then , people call turkish media the penguin media . ( laughter ) but this time , people knew what to do .
or consider seattle '99 , when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization , the world trade organization , by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize .
and think of more recent initiatives , like the # bringbackourgirls hashtags .
now , i believe so .
what we 're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work .
`` so when you see this march on washington in 1963 , when you look at that picture , where this is the march where martin luther king gave his famous `` '' i have a dream '' '' speech , 1963 , you do n't just see a march and you do n't just hear a powerful speech , you also see the painstaking , long-term work that can put on that march . ''
and if you 're in power , you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march , not just the march , but the capacity signaled by that march , seriously .
now , i want to be clear : the magic is not in the mimeograph .
so what 's the secret ?
but his party won two major elections within a year of the gezi protests with comfortable margins .
`` i can just sit back and relax . '' '' reaching success , i always tried to improve and do good work . ''
( laughter ) it did n't help .
and yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because i was just floating along . i could n't care less if clients ever called .
because they could see i was no longer serving them , i was only serving myself .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
it does n't look like this ; it really looks more like this .
i 'm curious , show of hands , who agrees with it ?
`` now , `` '' rational '' '' is the dominant paradigm in public health , and if you put your public health nerd glasses on , you 'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what 's good for them and what 's bad for them , if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information , and a little bit of motivation , people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives . ''
( laughter ) so , let 's start with what 's rational for an addict .
there 's just kind of an ick factor there .
`` `` no , no . we share needles because we do n't want to go to jail . '' ''
and while junkies think that it 's a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv , they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in frankie 's situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway .
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
so she was making a politically rational decision .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( laughter ) we 've taken a very different approach .
are we any more rational about sex ?
you can see these horrifying figures from africa .
you can only hiv by having unprotected sex with a positive person .
no one wants it .
but compared to what ? what happens if you 're not on treatment ?
but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need .
that 's simply not necessarily true , and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now .
and that 's boring , but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex , no matter how drunk you are , no matter how many poppers you 've taken , whatever ?
so these are data from scotland .
you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program .
but in gay men , you 've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
what does it mean ?
but once they 've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we do n't want to condone to being aids victims , we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives .
why does she do that job ?
we 've got the tools , the knowledge and the cash , and commitment to preventing hiv too .
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that 's one of the glories of human existence .
good afternoon , good evening , whatever .
and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where zeray left off yesterday .
and we 've also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of mankind through dna genetic profiling .
it 's kind of commonplace now , but his argument was — because he 'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in africa .
but what about how they behaved ? that 's what he wanted to know .
every chimpanzee has his or her own personality .
as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals , so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history .
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . greeting chimpanzees embracing .
they 're capable of extreme brutality , even a kind of primitive war .
it 's a very blurry line , and it 's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations .
the numbers increased by refugees pouring in from burundi and over the lake from congo .
and as a result of this program , something 's happening for conservation .
and as time went on , and as their situation began to improve , they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation .
today , we are developing what we call the greater gombe ecosystem .
this is an area way outside the national park , stretching out into all these very degraded lands .
you know , the famous scientist , e. o. wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european or american , we need three new planets .
`` today , major decisions — and i 'm not particularly talking about africa here , but the developed world — major decisions involving millions of dollars , and millions of people , are often based on , `` how will this affect the next shareholders ' meeting ? '' ''
and everywhere there were these terrible problems .
and it 's the poor people who are affected worse .
one of their projects will be to help animals — not just wildlife , domestic animals as well .
it 's one of my hobbyhorses .
or my grandchild , or whatever it is .
you can take an area that 's absolutely destroyed , with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate .
and just to think of one or two people out of africa who are just really inspiring .
and just a last word on that — the young woman who 's running this entire conference center , i met her today .
and it was very , very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people , when they are empowered , given the opportunity to take action , to make the world a better place , truly are our hope for tomorrow .
there are billions of people in developing countries who do n't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they 're worth so much more than it costs to build them .
but you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
he showed it to javier .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that 's worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
immediately after that vote , on february 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that 's being built in south korea — bigger than downtown boston .
there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there 's lots of people who 'd like to go there .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras ?
( applause )
if you were to go out there today , 20 years after this fishery collapsed , if you could catch a fish , which would be a bit of a challenge , it would be half that size still .
now for those species the we managed to leave alone , that we protect — for example , marine mammals in recent years and sea birds — there is some recovery .
now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one .
and i want to start with a bit on technology , because , of course , this is a ted conference and you want to hear something on technology .
we can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans .
and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways , these hot spots in the ocean , that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation .
so for example , they found something which was sold as tuna , which is very valuable , was in fact tilapia , which is a much less valuable fish .
this is where our sampling effort has concentrated .
so what did we find ?
well , i could stand here for hours , but , of course , i 'm not allowed to do that .
and what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution .
what is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags , or the ones that live far from the coast , are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes .
and that 's why biodiversity data can be so valuable .
but to be fair , it lives in the deep waters of the mid-atlantic ridge , so it was a lot harder to find .
and it shows that the ocean , because of its vastness , can hide secrets for a very long time .
so , steven spielberg , eat your heart out .
this is a location in the pacific where white shark converge .
if you were to suck all the water out of the ocean , this is what you 'd be left behind with , and that 's the biomass of life on the sea floor .
and so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice-based food web .
we also found the deepest vents known yet — 5,000 meters — the hottest vents at 407 degrees celsius — vents in the south pacific and also in the arctic where none had been found before .
and so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we 're likely to discover .
and so as we see in this image of light during the night , there are lots of areas of the earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it 's much less , but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean .
the other point i 'd like to make about this is that this ocean 's interconnected .
so whether you 're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile , whether you 're a stockbroker in new york city or whether you 're a tedster living in edinburgh , the oceans matter .
in fact , the head of harvard 's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe .
we 're going to have a personal universe .
i think we 're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge .
thank you .
so , microsoft — this is a project that — worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray , who 's our colleague , and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible .
and so worldwide telescope will be available this spring .
and so , what you 've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the ted lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off . ( laughter ) so we 'll see you there . thank you .
parents ' house , paying rent , selling vacuums ...
telemarketing , cutting grass at the local 4-h fairgrounds .
practically , i had to get a job .
we pick a play or select monologues from contemporary american plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is , grab a group of incredible theater-trained actors , arm them with incredible material , keep production value as minimal as possible — no sets , no costumes , no lights , just reading it — to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting .
and for the military , it 's the exact same .
i did n't get to finish mine , so whenever i get to be of service to this ultimate service industry , the military , for me , again — there 's not many things better than that .
`` ( applause ) we 're going to be doing a piece from marco ramirez , called `` '' i am not batman . '' '' an incredible actor and good friend of mine , jesse perez , is going to be reading , and matt johnson , who i just met a couple hours ago . ''
( laughter ) oh — and kill the joker .
and nobody — nobody ! — is gon na come between batman ...
and i pick him up , and i wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead .
and he begs me not to hurt him and i grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar , and i pull him to my face and he 's taller than me but the cape helps , so he listens when i look him straight in the eyes .
`` and i say two words to him : `` go home . '' ''
and i swoosh from building to building on his way there 'cause i know where he lives .
and i watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building .
and they get slower as they get to my room .
and he takes a step in , which he never does .
and he lifts it for i can see his face , for i could see his eyes .
and his cheeks is drippin ' , but not with sweat .
now this should n't come as a surprise to us .
rachel carson — the godmother of modern environmentalism — warned us about this very thing back in 1962 .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
for perfect scientific certainty .
`` a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like `` '' greed . '' '' this is a popular explanation , and there 's lots of truth to it , because taking big risks , as we all know , pays a lot of money . ''
so we have greed , we 've got overconfidence/hubris , but since we 're here at tedwomen , let 's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness .
`` it 's for motorola 's new rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , `` slap mother nature in the face . '' ''
and i 'm not just showing it to pick on motorola — that 's just a bonus .
there 's another one , equally important , about how that very same mother nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance .
because this is our real master-narrative : however much we mess up , there will always be more — more water , more land , more untapped resources .
a new bubble will replace the old one .
a new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
how else to explain the cultural space occupied by sarah palin ?
`` now on the one hand , exhorting us to `` '' drill , baby , drill , '' '' because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them , and on the other , glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show . ''
there are still no limits .
there will always be another frontier .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
it 's worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we 're on like little else .
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country — a place of such planetary pain that , like the bp gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long .
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
most importantly , we do n't have to change our lifestyles after all .
there 's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs .
the second challenge was cells .
so the concept here : so if you do have a deceased or injured organ , we take a very small piece of that tissue , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
it has the same conditions as the human body — 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen .
that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
this particular printer we 're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient .
this is how it actually works .
we 're also working on more sophisticated printers .
so this is more challenging — large organ , vascular , a lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of cells present .
we then are able to actually image those , do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form .
thank you .
i was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
and when i was 10 , i did n't realize how amazing it was .
now , to create these varieties , breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years .
the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach .
for this reason , farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance .
it was n't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance .
`` he said , `` '' seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice . '' '' that 's because their fields are flooded , and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day . ''
he asked if i would be willing to help them isolate this gene .
many people thought that the hawaiian papaya was doomed , but then , a local hawaiian , a plant pathologist named dennis gonsalves , decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering .
now , take a look at his field trial .
eighty percent of hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered .
now , some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food , but consider this : the genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus .
my final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition .
for this reason , scientists supported by the rockefeller foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta-carotene , which is the precursor of vitamin a .
the people who argue against gmos , as i understand it , the core piece comes from two things .
if we put out these brand new genes that we 've created , that have n't been challenged by years of evolution , and they started mixing up with the rest of what 's going on , could n't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem , especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there ?
farmers there can not afford the seed .
these seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification groups , so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available .
ca : would n't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy ?
the golden rice was developed through support of the rockefeller foundation .
`` [ 'academy award for special effects - ( first year of category ) '' '' ] ( explosion ) [ `` '' '2012 ' ( 2009 ) '' '' ] governor : it seems to me that the worst is over . ''
however , what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition — so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
oh , wow !
how about getting older ?
what you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
intake of flavonoids , which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries , will increase neurogenesis .
( laughter ) and then finally , let me point out the last one — a quirky one .
but this diet has also been given to human participants , and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis , such as : calorie restriction will improve memory capacity , whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression — as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids , which increase neurogenesis , and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression .
so we think that the effect of diet on mental health , on memory and mood , is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus .
thank you .
sandrine thuret , thank you so much .
well , you wade into a pit of about 120 of them , then you hope that you 've made the right decision .
am : well , for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio — it might have given it away — i 'm a double amputee , and i was born without fibulas in both legs .
`` and i heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners , and i figured , `` '' oh , i do n't know about this , but before i judge it , let me go see what it 's all about . '' '' so , i booked myself a flight to boston in '95 , 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race . i 'd never done it before . ''
and i thank god i did n't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world .
`` and i called him up and said , `` '' listen , i ran one race and i won ... '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' i want to see if i can , you know — i need to just see if i can sit in on some of your practices , see what drills you do and whatever . '' '' that 's all i wanted — just two practices . ''
`` `` can i just sit in and see what you do ? '' ''
ss : well , on your way to the olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .
so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i 'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and could n't run 50 meters .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
`` i 'm sitting there , like , `` '' oh , my god . oh , my god . '' '' you know , i 'd never lost anything , like , whether it would be the scholarship or , you know , i 'd won five golds when i skied . in everything , i came in first . ''
and georgetown — that was great .
and i remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd , like , the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see .
`` ( laughter ) i mean , it was definitely the `` '' rocky iv '' '' sensation of me versus germany , and everyone else — estonia and poland — was in this heat . ''
all this training — i had transformed my life .
so , i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do : sitting back and realizing the progression , how far you 've come at this day to this goal , you know .
it 's important to focus on a goal , i think , but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you 've grown as a person .
that 's the achievement , i think . that 's the real achievement .
( laughter ) no , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful .
but without having the silicon sock , i 'm just going to try slip in it .
if you ever watch a sprinter , the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
am : so , these are the sprint legs , and i can put my other ...
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
communication was hard for isaac , and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know .
great , right ?
as my high school algebra teacher used to say , show your math , because if i do n't know what steps you took , i do n't know what steps you did n't take , and if i do n't know what questions you asked , i do n't know what questions you did n't ask .
and it means asking ourselves , really , the hardest question of all : did the data really show us this , or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable ?
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
it 's a lot .
now if you 'd have asked me that a year ago , i would n't have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
but in the new project that i 'm working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you 're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
guy : i do n't know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
no , that 's what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
but why ? well , transparency is scary — ( roar ) like that odd , still-screaming bear .
( laughter ) it 's unpredictable — ( music ) ( laughter ) like this odd country road .
and it 's also very risky .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me — and that 's only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years — i realized that i would have to go on my own , i 'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challenger brand .
ms : technology 's not the way you want to describe something somebody 's putting in their armpit .

ms : all right , what is brand gerry ?
gerry : unique . ( ms : unique . ) man : i guess what kind of genre , style i am would be like dark glamor .
( video ) abigail : you brought your pictures , right ?
a : what 's the next one you want to talk about ?
i like things that are different .
what is the machete ? what pupa stage are you in now ?
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
what other brands are like that ?
are you an up attribute ? are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like errol flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like gandalf .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
that 's only online — no print , no tv .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse , then you 're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
i study how the brain processes information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
it 's really our first foray into this .
there are some drug treatments , but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population . and so , for the vast majority of patients , their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices .
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . and when i say code , i do literally mean code .
and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .
so no other device has been able to do this .
`` i 'm not sure `` '' cool '' '' is really the right word , but you know what i mean . ''
and so , in a way , the equations are serving as sort of a codebook . an image comes in , goes through the set of equations , and out comes streams of electrical pulses , just like a normal retina would produce .
how important is this ?
what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see ?
so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .
but after the food goes through the digestive system , when it is thrown out as crap , it is no longer fashionable to speak about it .
on the most part , we were producing biogas , biogas for rural kitchens .
and we came together and formed a project called mantra .
mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas .
and when both are ready , they build a toilet , a shower room , and of course also a water tower , an elevated water reservoir .
and boys , about 30 percent .
people are questioning , people are governing themselves , people are learning to manage their own affairs , they are taking their own futures into their hands .
you might be wondering why i 'm wearing sunglasses , and one answer to that is , because i 'm here to talk about glamour .
and it comes in a male form , too — very glamorous .
and there 's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur .
this is very , very glamorous : the glamour of outer space — and not the alien-style glamour , but the nice , clean , early '60s version .
and it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary , in this case the 1913 dictionary .
`` you had `` '' a '' '' glamour . ''
glamour is a magic spell .
well of course , in the 20th century , glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood .
there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts .
you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see max factor 's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up .
glamour is a form of falsification , but falsification to achieve a particular purpose .
`` there is a process of `` '' idealization , glorification and dramatization , '' '' and it 's not just the case for people . ''
it puts you into this special , special world .
and i think that that 's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is .
and i do n't know who she is either , but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel .
why is it glamorous ?
the notion is that it 's going to transport you , and the story is not about , you know , the guy in front of you in the airplane , who has this nasty little kid , or the big cough .
the story is about where you 're arriving , or thinking about where you 're arriving .
`` in order to pull glamour off , you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura , which is a term coined by castiglione in his book , `` '' the book of the courtier . '' '' there 's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today , after a few centuries . ''
but if you look in a catalog — particularly a catalog of modern , beautiful objects for your home — it looks like this .
look next time you get these catalogs in your mail — you can usually figure out where they hid the cord .
and there she is — grace .
this is the most glamorous picture , i think , ever .
and , you know , this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because , like sunglasses , it conceals and reveals at the same time .
and certainly , no , it does n't look a thing like my office .
i mean , there 's no paper on the desk .
what is your ideal , and also , what has been edited out ?
is it something important ?
national socialism is all about glamour .
so glamour can be dangerous .
but there 's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .
she 's very glamorous but , you know , she invented spread-spectrum technology .
`` there 's a wonderful book called `` '' crowns '' '' that 's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats . ''
i spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace .
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to doodle officially means to dawdle , to dilly dally , to monkey around , to make meaningless marks , to do something of little value , substance or import , and — my personal favorite — to do nothing .
there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions .
now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it , we have to engage at least two of those modalities , or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
the organ that does all the thinking and perceiving and imagining , of course , is the brain .
so these are sort of in the same style as ramón y cajal .
it would be so crowded , so full of structure , of wiring all connecting one neuron to another .
`` the basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say , `` that 's a bird , '' which is a very simple thing for us to do with our brains . ''
and those feed forward into one layer after another layer , after another layer of neurons , all connected by synapses of different weights .
the behavior of this network is characterized by the strengths of all of those synapses .
i 'm putting the times in scare quotes because what 's really going on there , of course , is a very complicated series of mathematical operations .
and we all know that if you have one equation , you can solve one variable by knowing the other two things .
so the problem of inference , that is , figuring out that the picture of a bird is a bird , is this one : it 's where y is the unknown and w and x are known .
so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
i 'm glossing over the very difficult part , of course , which is how on earth do we figure out the w , the brain that can do such a thing ?
so this process of learning , of solving for w , if we were doing this with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers , we know exactly how to do that : 6 = 2 x w , well , we divide by two and we 're done .
so , division — we 've used division because it 's the inverse to multiplication , but as i 've just said , the multiplication is a bit of a lie here .
in other words , if we 've solved for w the right way , then the error will be zero .
so you 've taken an initial guess : what if w = 0 ?
we figure out how we can solve for w , that 's learning , which is a lot harder , because we need to do error minimization , using a lot of training examples .
a picture of birds .
you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this , and you get some pretty crazy stuff .
( laughter ) or , mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image , hallucinates , zooms , hallucinates , zooms hallucinates , zooms .
and in this way , you can get a sort of fugue state of the network , i suppose , or a sort of free association , in which the network is eating its own tail .
`` what do i think i see next ? what do i think i see next ? '' '' i showed this for the first time in public to a group at a lecture in seattle called `` '' higher education '' '' — this was right after marijuana was legalized . ''
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
`` and i said to myself , `` i wan na get me one of them . '' ''
take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .
now , see this strange , underwater , coral reef-looking thing ?
or maybe your brother-in-law who does n't believe in global warming .
she 's an activist from the right , and i 'm an activist from the left .
and then , before you get together , agree on some ground rules .
i think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
she thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
by the end of our lunch , we acknowledged each other 's openness .
`` i 'll meet you there . '' '' ( applause ) ''
but i also felt more alive than i 've ever done since .
and i found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life , as if i was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond .
now , i do n't romanticize evolutionary time .
i 'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers , and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs is n't very hard to predict .
and as soon as i found that word , i realized that i wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it .
the numbers of deer , because there was nothing to hunt them , had built up and built up in the yellowstone park , and despite efforts by humans to control them , they 'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing , they 'd just grazed it away .
bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood .
the number of beavers started to increase , because beavers like to eat the trees .
but here 's where it gets really interesting .
and when you look at it like that , you think , wait a minute , here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the yellowstone national park .
and they make , in my view , a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species .
i believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology , as we 're doing now , but at the same time , if we choose , have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful , rewilded habitats .
now , faced with opportunities like that , does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves , lynx , bears , beavers , bison , boar , moose , and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across europe ?
well , every continent had one , apart from antarctica .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
it was a lot bigger than the asian elephant .
is n't it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street , you can see the shadows of these great beasts ?
♫ have but i do n't have ♫ ♫ it feels like all i got is loss on a bad back ♫ ♫ gone with the last train , honey do n't you fret ♫ ♫ every cloud has a silver lining ♫

( laughter ) amazing . amazing performance .
i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things .
because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate , and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems .
and then , also , was working with broad strategies .
in this case , we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land , and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the olympic village .
its position , of course , in the middle of manhattan — it 's on hunter 's point .
it literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base .
and it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things , and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces , and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations .
and now we 're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated .
and you 're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body .
it 's part of a sign system , which was part of the kind of legacy of los angeles — the two-dimension , three-dimension signing , etc .
and an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium , that light becomes literally a building material .
this will be the first building in the united states that took — well , i ca n't say it took the air conditioning out . it 's a hybrid .
it forces air through a venturi force if there 's no wind .
10 of these — it 's just under a million square feet — 800 and some thousand square feet — 10 of these would power sausalito — the delta on this .
and so now what we 're looking at , as the projects get larger in scale , as they interface with broader problems , that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
this is , of course , michael heizer .
and when i saw this , first an image and then visited , it completely changed the way i thought after that point .
and it 's the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable .
and there it is , again , as it 's starting to get resolved tectonically , and then there 's the school .
and there 's an overt — at least , there 's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because i was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem , as one would understand that .
and it led us to the project , the courthouse , which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse .
and we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives , but we rarely see or listen to one .
the idea is , let 's have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal — about half a second — let 's see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
as you can see here , she likes to use a joystick , like any one of us , any of our kids , to play this game .
so even before a target appears that she 's supposed to cross with the cursor that she 's controlling with this joystick , aurora is trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
the model of the self that aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm .
just fast forward 10 years .
so what you see here is this is the design of the task .
so when we look at the brains of these animals , on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells showing what happens with the brain activity , the electrical storms , of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick .
the basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions .
this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously .
and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling , literally crumbling .
imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
the good news is a third of you did n't hold up your hand . your apple 's still out there .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
`` `` '' as grown in new york , the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is , on the whole , unsatisfactory . '' '' ( laughter ) and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here , and the lesson is : so why save it ? ''
i do n't know . can fish play the piano ?
it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape . i ca n't even begin to describe it to you .
the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold , so we get natural freezing temperatures .
but it 's remote . it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we do n't depend on mechanical refrigeration .
we have now about 425,000 samples of unique crop varieties .
and it takes place in an area called the shephelah in what is now israel .
ancient palestine had a — along its eastern border , there 's a mountain range .
and the shephelah , if you 've been to israel , you 'll know it 's just about the most beautiful part of israel .
the philistines , who are the biggest of enemies of the kingdom of israel , are living in the coastal plain .
and the philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
`` so he says , `` '' all right . '' '' and then he turns to the kid , and he says , `` but you 've got to wear this armor . you ca n't go as you are . '' ''
and the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes — right here , in his most vulnerable spot — and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run .
and of course , the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong .
in fact , that term , david and goliath , has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger .
well , we call him an underdog because he 's a kid , a little kid , and goliath is this big , strong giant .
it 's not this , right ? it 's not a child 's toy .
this is an incredibly devastating weapon .
accuracy , we know from historical records that slingers — experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards .
they were incredibly accurate .
when david lines up — and he 's not 200 yards away from goliath , he 's quite close to goliath — when he lines up and fires that thing at goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
there 's a second piece of this that 's important .
and then there 's this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath to react to the sight of david .
so david 's coming down the mountain , and he 's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
well , it turns out that there 's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies .
so goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the norm , there 's an explanation for it .
thank you .

when dorothy was a little girl , she was fascinated by her goldfish .
we tell ourselves what we can and can not do .
four : i lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease .
you open your eyes and there 's the world .
well , that 's what i thought .
reaching down to wash my hands , i suddenly saw it was a urinal i was touching , not a sink , when my fingers felt its true shape .
i learned that what we see is not universal truth .
what you see is a complex mental construction of your own making , but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you .
let 's take fear as just one example .
under the warped logic of fear , anything is better than the uncertain .
when you face a compelling opportunity to take action , fear lulls you into inaction , enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves .
blindness was a death sentence for my independence .
it is a learned discipline .
i chose to build there a blessed life .
what lies do you tell yourself ?
this is an audience of entrepreneurs , of doers , of innovators .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
isaac lidsky : well , the biggest challenge became a blessing .
so , for example , in my leadership team meetings , i do n't see facial expressions or gestures .
eric x. li : now — ( laughter ) ( applause ) this story also became a bestseller .
yes , china is a one-party state run by the chinese communist party , the party , and they do n't hold elections .
well , the assumptions are wrong .
adaptability , meritocracy , and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of china 's one-party system .
china 's highest ruling body , the politburo , has 25 members .
in the larger central committee of 300 or more , the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller .
over time , the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju [ deputy bureau chief ] and ju [ bureau chief ] levels .
after the ju levels , the best few move further up several more ranks , and eventually make it to the central committee .
at this rate , i 'm afraid it is democracy , not china 's one-party system , that is in danger of losing legitimacy .
the country faces enormous challenges .
pollution is one . food safety . population issues .
transparency international ranks china between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries , and it 's been moving up .
i 'm not here to make an indictment of democracy .
it is the universal claim that many western elites are making about their political system , the hubris , that is at the heart of the west 's current ills .
if they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others , and a little bit more on political reform at home , they might give their democracy a better chance .
what is the mechanism in the chinese model that allows people to say , actually , the national interest as you defined it is wrong ?
do you know who their biggest client is ?
not just from the central government , the city government , the provincial government , to the most local neighborhood districts .
are you happy with the garbage collection ?
exl : there 's a vibrant civil society in china , whether it 's environment or what-have-you .
for thousands of years , you have civil society , yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order , and i think it 's a big cultural difference .
he 's making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
well , suffice it to say it 's not all like that , but that 's part of it .
when i was first learning to meditate , the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath , and when my mind wandered , to bring it back .
trigger , behavior , reward .
obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world .
now , the prefrontal cortex , that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective , it understands on an intellectual level that we should n't smoke .
now , we can all relate to this in our own experience .
these are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge , scary craving that we choke on .
now , remember that bit about context-dependent memory ?
instead of see text message , compulsively text back , feel a little bit better — notice the urge , get curious , feel the joy of letting go and repeat .
thank you .
i do n't know if you 've noticed , but there 's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
do they think , do they feel and , if so , how ?
i resented the way you moved , your lack of animal grace , the way you would sit in a chair to eat , a napkin on your lap , a knife in your hand .
and so we spent a summer looking at different play-doh recipes .
we have two favorite recipes — one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt .
well , it conducts electricity .
well now if i take that sugar dough , the sugar dough does n't want to conduct electricity .
i plug in again the power to it .
i can start plugging in lots of lights .
and we can start talking about things like electrical load .
have fun . thank you .
`` she said , `` '' oh , great you called . ''
`` we have four or five apartments available right now . '' '' she said , `` '' do you want a one-bedroom or two-bedroom ? '' '' then she said , `` '' let 's not talk about that . ''
so as a result of that , and feeling rejected , i went back to the base , and i talked to the squadron commander .
there 's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer .
`` so , what i did — and he said , `` '' you should n't worry , jim , because there are a lot of trailer parks . '' '' so i put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks . ''
`` and as a result , the kind of comments that they made to me , in addition to saying that they did n't have any slots open , one person said , `` '' jim , the reason why we ca n't rent to you , we already have a negro family in the trailer park . '' '' he said , `` '' and it 's not me , because i like you people . '' '' ( laughs ) and that 's what i did , too . i chuckled , too . ''
`` he said , `` '' but here 's the problem : if i let you in , the other tenants will move out and i ca n't afford to take that kind of a hit . '' '' he said , `` '' i just ca n't rent to you . '' '' even though that was discouraging , it did n't stop me . ''
it did n't have any paved roads in it , it did n't have the concrete slabs , it did n't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer slots .
but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i did n't have a lot of other options .
my mother called and said she 'll fly out .
she 'll be with us as we drive , she 'll help us manage the children .
`` and so i walked to the counter , and she said , `` '' how can i help you ? '' '' i said , `` '' i would like to get a motel for the evening for my family . '' '' she said , `` '' you know , i 'm really sorry , i just rented the last one . ''
( laughter ) here it is , 53 years later , i now have nine grandchildren , two great-grandchildren .
i have master 's , ph.d. , undergrad , one in medical school .
so we 're just trying to get him to stay in school .
what can we do ? we do everything that you told us to do .
if asked to get identification , we tell them , 'i am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my i.d . ' when pulled out of the car to be searched , when laid on the ground to be searched , when our trunks are opened to be searched , we do n't push back , we do n't challenge because we know , you 've told us , 'do n't you challenge the police .
how do i keep them safe ? how do i keep them alive ?
we have to challenge that . it does n't make any sense .
i think that without perhaps being able to name it , we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue .
it is so important when we 're communicating big ideas — but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion — to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood — the color and complexity of life .
he says that he 's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we 're all on .
he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi — he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
`` we put these two photographs side-by-side on our website , and someone said , `` '' when i look at the first photo , i ask myself , what was he thinking ? ''
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
and i wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make of the two lives this ring has worked .
the story need not be this gloomy , though .
and these arguments are getting stronger , not weaker , with time .
`` when the financial crisis hit in 2008 , the central banks of the us and uk began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as `` '' quantitative easing . '' '' depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature , this is money printing by another name . ''
in a remarkable act of cooperation , the 188 countries that make up the international monetary fund , the imf , agreed to issue 250 billion dollars ' worth of their own currency — the special drawing right — to boost reserves around the world .
`` the bank of japan repeated those words — that exact same commitment — to do `` '' whatever it takes '' '' to reflate their economy . ''
three years ago , the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo .
think : weimar republic in 1930 ; zimbabwe more recently , in 2008 , when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day .
but here — here 's the intriguing part .
more than half of those extra sdrs that were printed in 2009 — 150 billion dollars ' worth — went to developed market countries who , for the most part , have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves , because they have flexible exchange rates .
so , for example , the issuance of these extra sdrs every five years could be capped , such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves .
that 's 30 times what it has today .
we could take cars off the roads for a generation .
`` we must , must , must do `` '' whatever it takes . '' '' thank you . ''
( applause )
and i carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope .
but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and did n't even know how to fill this cup .
i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience .
`` as gandhi said , `` to a hungry man , a piece of bread is the face of god . '' ''
and i thought , there 's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that can not be returned with food — the most fundamental expectation of every human being .
one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug , my hero .
but today i 'm going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on earth for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories .
and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge .
but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years .
because actually we know how to fix it very simply .
i 'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is .
you may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every 22 seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life .
and i go to those shops , if there are any , or out to the fields to see what they can get , and they can not obtain the nutrition .
and i 'm very excited about this , because one thing we 're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops .
we know this .
but they 've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources .
food is gold there .
food can be there and people ca n't buy it .
the shopkeepers are hiring more people .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
`` we 'll pick it up . we 'll make sure it 's stored properly . '' '' — their yields have gone up two- , three- , fourfold and they figure it out , because it 's the first guaranteed opportunity they 've had in their life . ''
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars — 10.3 — to address malnutrition in those countries .
`` when a leader says , `` '' not under my watch , '' '' everything begins to change . ''
this is n't likely how you think about the fbi .
abdul-latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide .
this is n't an outlier .
the lead defendant was james cromitie , a broke walmart employee with a history of mental problems .
he sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this .
but that did n't stop the fbi .
thank you .
in kind of a comical turn in that particular case , one of the defendant 's mother had found out that he was interested in going to syria and had hid his passport .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
okay , one more . baby elephant .
so what i did was , i filmed six of my friends and then , using video mapping and video projection , i created a video sculpture , which was these six friends projected into jars . ( laughter ) so now i have this collection of my friends i can take around with me whenever i go , and this is called animalia chordata , from the latin nomenclature for human being , classification system .
you , like the people that are trapped in my work — ( blender noises , laughter ) — have become part of my work as well . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) but , but this seems a bit unfair , right ?
so i start as a baby , and then if you punch the clock , you 'll actually transform the baby into a toddler , and then from a toddler i 'm transformed into a teenager .
and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day , the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day .
things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone .
i could even search for any information by myself .
ca : now ...
i was born in sierra leone .
`` did anybody watch `` '' blood diamond '' '' ? ''
be seated . you 're fine . i was checked before i got here .
i do n't think so . there you go .
oh yeah , he was .
the next day , i woke up , bombs were dropping everywhere , and people were trying to kill me and my family .
while we were there as refugees , we did n't know what was going to become of us .
she put us in a car , and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia .
`` i 'm standing there thinking , `` this is very confusing . i do n't know what 's going on . '' ''
i struggled and tried to get her off me , but i could n't .
she slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is .
we got to adelaide , small place , where literally they dumped us in adelaide , that 's what i would say .
and we saw a lot of asian people .
six hundred white kids , and i was the only black child there .
all we had was some tan girls , girls who felt the need to be under the sun .
it was n't the same as my chocolate , though . not the same .
yes , i was aware something bad happened to me , but i had no recollection of what had happened .
i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down .
oh my god .
a little one , but angry nevertheless .
`` i 'm like , `` '' those years ago , you circumcised me . ''
( laughter ) just saying , it was n't me . it was dolly that said that .
`` he wo n't have that problem with me . '' '' ( laughter ) so i said to my mom , `` '' dolly and girlfriend said i deserve pleasure , and do you know what you have taken away from me , what you have denied me ? ''
we came from two different worlds .
i was an african australian girl .
`` i was settling in a new country , i was dealing with racism and discrimination , english is my third language , and then there it was . '' '' i said to her , `` '' i feel like i 'm not a woman because of what was done to me . ''
this is an australian problem , people .
it 's violence against women .
i could try , but i ca n't .
( applause ) and if i could share the image with you on the screen .
here you have the fertility rate — the number of children per woman — and there you have the length of life in years .
the last century , 1870 , was bad for the kids in europe , because most of this statistics is europe .
it was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year .
and this is the united states moving away here , earning more money .
there he died , then deng xiaoping brings money .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and this is the drama of this world which many call globalized , is that asia , arabic countries , latin america , are much more ahead in being healthy , educated , having human resources than they are economically .
and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the red toyota down there , and the brownish volvo .
this is the war . the toyota got off track , and now the toyota is coming on the healthier side of sweden — can you see that ?
sweden was like sierra leone today .
sweden was like ghana .
( laughter ) but homage to singapore .
singapore is the best one .
carbon-dioxide emission , metric ton per capita .
the oecd countries — the high-income countries — they were the ones who caused the climate change .
and this is really what has to be changed .
this family earns about one dollar per day .
`` get us a mill so that we can mill our flour , then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves . '' '' technology will bring you out of poverty , but there 's a need for a market to get away from poverty . ''
i have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine .
and i know 200 , i know about the small data .
i 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
governance . to have a government which functions — that 's what brought california out of the misery of 1850 .
health is also important , but not that much as a mean .
human rights is also important , but it just gets one cross .
human rights is the goal , but it 's not that strong of a mean for achieving development .
that 's the value of living .
even african countries can achieve this .
( applause )
`` maybe it was shifting around . '' '' he said , `` '' well , we do n't want to take any chances . '' '' i said okay . ''
`` would your decision be to induce ? '' '' `` `` well , no , i would wait until you were at least 38 weeks , but you are almost 42 , there is no reason to leave that baby inside , let 's get you a room . '' '' i said , `` '' well , why do n't we just do it again ? ''
where are we here with this miscarriage thing ?
`` i said , `` '' okay , out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women , how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date ? ''
and so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced .
here 's a standard chart of a woman 's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle .
clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle .
what is that data telling you ?
she wants to keep them warm , protect them and keep them warm .
but if you do get pregnant , sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months .
that 's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot , because their temperatures are high .
what is it that we can do to help prevent this problem ?
now , what is it , if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor , your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood .
`` and so , that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says , `` honey , i ca n't breath out of my nose . '' ''
and the whole time i 'm driving and i 'm thinking , you ca n't die on me now .
you do n't have to have a ph.d. in statistics to be an expert in yourself .
you do n't have to have a medical degree to be your body 's expert .
and so when two of you come together , when two experts come together , the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone .
i challenge you to take ownership of your data .
audience : show me the data ! talithia williams : i ca n't hear you ! audience : show me the data !
as you can see , my legs are bionic .
because you see , on the one hand , there is the digital world and no question , many things are happening there right now .
as humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
again , it 's a mobile phone-shaped box , and this one can change its shape .
it 's like tapered to the downside .
it 's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands .
`` you ca n't see it , but it 's there . '' '' and you can feel that because it 's thicker at that edge . ''
think of a hamster in the pocket .
let me show you the living mobile phone .
what 's behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .
let 's begin with a story .
he was never informed of the results of the test .
people are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition , none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect .
who here has been touched by hiv — either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with hiv ?
and i 'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with hiv , but people who are at greatest risk of infection — people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners .
`` the nurse said to me , `` '' why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are hiv positive ? ''
they did n't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form .
only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it .
let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference .
they 're at high risk of hiv through contaminated injection equipment and other risk-related behaviors .
and hey , surprise , very high rates of hiv among people who are injecting drugs .
so for example , outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest .
but awareness needs action .
but along the way , i 've learned that it 's not just the technical side , but there 's also this thing called the culture of crap .
if you 're a washer , then you use water for anal cleansing . that 's the technical term .
and if you 're a wiper , then you use toilet paper or , in some regions of the world where it 's not available , newspaper or rags or corncobs .
you 've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents .
as you can see , there 's no protective equipment , no protective clothing .
so you ask yourself , how can we solve this and why do n't we just build western-style flush toilets for these two and a half billion ?
and is this really the solution ?
we start with a human interface , and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored , transported , treated and reused — and not just disposal but reuse .
so let 's start with the human user interface .
so we can open ourselves to possibilities like , for example , this urine-diverting toilet , and there 's two holes in this toilet .
i believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right .
and as activists , we would take our polaroid camera , we would take her picture , we would wait 90 seconds , and we would give her the photograph .
there was no justice .
and so we went to washington , and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation .
it is about economic empowerment for women , it is about healing kids who are hurt , and it is about prevention with a capital p .
and we looked around the world to canada and australia and brazil and parts of africa , and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence .
woman : well , i thought you 'd be home a couple hours ago , and i put everything away , so— man : what is this ? pizza . woman : if you had just called me , i would have known— man : dinner ? dinner ready is a pizza ? woman : honey , please do n't be so loud .
we could n't solve this problem with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines .
`` and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said , `` '' you want men to talk about violence against women and girls . men do n't talk . '' '' ( laughter ) i apologize to the men in the audience . ''
i know you do .
they do talk to their kids .
we met men where they were at and we built a program .
technology has been our friend .
if i go out in the open ocean environment , virtually anywhere in the world , and i drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface , most of the animals — in fact , in many places , 80 to 90 percent of the animals that i bring up in that net — make light .
i knew my forward speed , i knew the area , and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .
so , if you stagger into the head late at night and you 're so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light , you may think that you 're having a religious experience . ( laughter ) so , how does a living creature make light ?
so this little guy has found himself this babe , and you will note that he 's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he does n't actually have to look at her .
they use it a lot for defense , many different ways .
a lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud .
this shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness .
this fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light .
this jellyfish , for example , has a spectacular bioluminescent display .
this is us chasing it in the submersible .
`` and i thought , `` '' you know , that might actually make a pretty good lure . '' '' because one of the things that 's frustrated me as a deep-sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean . ''
when i 'm sitting in a submersible though , i know that i 'm not unobtrusive at all — i 've got bright lights and noisy thrusters — any animal with any sense is going to be long gone .
it 's not exactly rocket science . we call this thing eye-in-the-sea .
and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used , the word ziploc is still visible .
eighty-six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display , we recorded this : this is a squid , over six feet long , that is so new to science , it can not be placed in any known scientific family .
so one of these take-home messages here is , there is still a lot to explore in the oceans .
and sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what 's in them , and she 's right .
i promise , you 'll love it .
next , he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital .
he recast the very purpose of medicine .
they folded samosas for our entire mosque .
( laughter ) ln : it turns out it was way easier to do it virtually .
( audio ) nr : the size of this thing , it was huge . it 's a really big animal .
( audio ) nr : we took a saw , and we nicked just the edge of it , and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it .
it was a smell that natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab : collagen .
but in this case , the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it .
so she shipped him one of the fragments , fedex .
( audience reacts ) yeah .
( music : the star-spangled banner ) ( laughter ) they started here .
like , how ... how ?
thank you very much .
some said three .
the dsm also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress — there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships — and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row .
well , pms has become a permission slip to be angry , complain , be irritated , without losing the title of good woman .
amazon.com currently offers over 1,900 books on pms treatment .
so we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments .
women have made tremendous strides in the workforce , but still there 's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business , and when we think about who makes for a good ceo or senator , someone who has qualities like rationality , steadiness , competence come to mind , and in our culture , that sounds more like a man than a woman , and the pms myth contributes to that .
( applause )
maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything .
we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway , and if in some way we are , do n't worry .
and i was fascinated .
and i thought to myself , this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system .
it 's got 120,000 processors ; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second .
that 's 10 to the sixteenth . and they consume one and a half megawatts of power .
so the question is , how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency ?
they send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other , and where they contact each other , those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other .
that process is called a synapse .
and nobody was listening then , but now people are beginning to listen because there 's a pressing , technological problem that we face .
and i 'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one , and the absence of current to represent a zero .
now , what 's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this .
and that means that a transistor corresponds to about 12 ion channels in parallel .
that 's the red path that 's highlighted .
so even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero , and it does n't show up , there 's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information .
it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that i described .
this is kareem 's dark eyes and that 's the white background that you see here .
and these four types of information — your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it , and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information .
do you put together in your mind the work you 're doing , the future of africa , this conference — what connections can we make , if any , between them ?
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
thank you .
( applause )
he led them to america .
because when you think about the solar system , you might think about this picture here .
so it 's a lot of material just stuck together with this attractive force .
and so this is what 's actually causing atmospheric escape here on earth and also on other planets — that interplay between heating from the star and overcoming the force of gravity on the planet .
so these two images of the earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen looks like , shown in red .
so these are pictures that conclusively show us that our atmosphere is n't just tightly bound to us here on earth but it 's actually reaching out far into space , and at an alarming rate , i might add .
but the earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape .
that 's because we think mars used to have a wetter past , and when water had enough energy , it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen , and hydrogen being so light , it escaped into space , and the oxygen that was left oxidized or rusted the ground , making that familiar rusty red color that we see .
it 's the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution spacecraft .
and the reason that it 's blinking is because there are planets that are going past it all the time , and it 's at special orientation where the planets are blocking the light from the star that allows us to see that light blinking .
and we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere of hydrogen all around the planet that 's making it look puffier and thus blocking more of the light that you see .
so you might think , well , does this make the planet cease to exist ?
well , in the far future , the sun is going to get brighter .
it does concern you , as well .
i led a five-year national geographic expedition , the sustainable seas expeditions , using these little subs .
three years ago , i met john hanke , who 's the head of google earth , and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously .
`` but i asked him : `` '' when are you going to finish it ? ''
consider this : starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we 're sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and california 's four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what 's below .
that 's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
we 're still killing bluefin tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
we kill using long lines , with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
there are still some krill in antarctica .
the good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
a global plan of action with a world conservation union , the iucn , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places .
it 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos , and it 's probably our oldest scourge .
we 've got 300 million cases a year and over half a million deaths .
we 've known how to cure malaria since the 1600s .
this little creature survives under siege like that , but not only does it survive , it has thrived .
it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages .
we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives .
and that 's actually true for most of the world 's malaria .
and this effort well understood the economic challenge .
the whole campaign crashed , malaria resurged back , but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places in the most difficult-to-control forms .
and yet we 're asking people to use these nets every night .
they have to sleep under them every night .
`` imagine , for example , if a bunch of well-meaning kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said , `` '' you know , you people have a lot of cold and flu . ''
take the example of england and the united states .
we have drugs and vaccines .
and even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too .
and therefore , there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases .
now , the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha — a mouthful .
as part of my job , i spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters .
some were toxic , including the tropical milkweed , with very high concentrations of these cardenolides .
what if they can act as medical doctors ?
they can also not medicate themselves .
now , this is a really important discovery , i think , not just because it tells us something cool about nature , but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs .
they have tiny little brains , yet they can do this very sophisticated medication .
and the reason why is this : traffic is getting worse .
traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago .
so if you take the average commute time in america , which is about 50 minutes , you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have , that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day .
we should do something about that .
eight orders of magnitude .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
now , the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles .
and then , even more importantly , we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world .
now , we do n't have to deal with just ducks .
here we 're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than mountain view .
here , as we make a lane change , the car to our left decides it wants to as well .
in the morning , however , there was nothing to eat .
it 's a problem like any other .
this gets me really excited .
think how powerful this is .
the product of farming is , of course , food .
look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman .
we just have n't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet , particularly in sub-saharan africa .
humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago , in theory .
we buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network , and store it in 20 warehouses like this .
it 's kind of like amazon for rural farmers .
and i believe we stand at a moment in time where collectively , we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers .
you can order pizza anywhere in this territory and it 'll arrive to your house hot , fresh and delicious .
i 'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming .
so again , in every area of human development , super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive , highly effective tools .
again , using a map of the united states for scale , this is what i would call a highly achievable delivery zone .
we just lack the will .
for private investors , we need a big expansion of venture capital , private equity , working capital , available in emerging markets .
( applause )
`` he said , `` '' a human being is a part of the whole , called by us , the 'universe , ' — a part limited in time and space . ''
this delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
and he was rubbing it with a cloth .
`` well , at least i can clean this wound and wash it . '' '' so , he takes it to some water . he 's about to clean , but then his awareness focuses on the maggots . ''
so he goes down , and he 's sticking his tongue out like this .
`` and he said , `` '' you did n't have , until this moment , real compassion . ''
`` and , until you have real compassion , you can not recognize love . '' '' `` `` maitreya '' '' means love , `` '' the loving one , '' '' in sanskrit . ''
`` the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions . here he is . '' '' and then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him — it was n't chautauqua , it was some other town — because they saw a demented looking , scrawny looking yogi man , like some kind of hippie , with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder , shouting that the future buddha had come . ''
but , you know , after all , they 're nice to me .
so , they first create this foundation of equality .
we expand . we take the feeling about remembering a mama , and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation .
and they 're rushing around all stressed out .
and i 'm sure he did that later . ( laughter ) but that just indicates the state of mind , you know .
of course in theistic religion they 're punished by god or whatever .
`` do n't just think , `` '' well , i 'm compassionate , '' '' or `` '' i 'm not compassionate , '' '' and sort of think you 're stuck there . ''
and now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
they want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
( laughter ) so how come [ this is ] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ? what is special with this ?
look here , you see the seven billion people up there : the air people , the wash people , the bulb people and the fire people .
and they also have electricity .
what are the trends ? if we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use .
second , economic growth .
`` `` '' wopp ! '' '' they will say . ''
it 's a real challenge in the future .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
and what 's the magic with them ?
my mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day .
`` and now we can go to the library . '' '' because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ? ''
`` she loved this . i got the `` '' abc 's '' '' — this is where i started my career as a professor , when my mother had time to read for me . ''
and she also got books for herself .
what is going to be the future of learning ?
i do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , i need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage .
in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional .
what are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
well , i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
then onto other parts of the country , i repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were .
`` [ `` '' hole in the wall film - 1999 '' '' ] an eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do . ''
i got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they did n't know doing something that 's a decade ahead of their time .
`` so i asked this girl , `` '' can you help them ? '' '' so she says , `` '' absolutely not . ''
when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
could it be — a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by nicholas negroponte — could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?
`` we take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , `` '' perform . '' '' why did they create a system like that ? ''
i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe . ( laughter ) they 're called the granny cloud .
they are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together .
( children talking ) this one is in england .
my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
it 's a facility which is practically unmanned .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i 'll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
and just one last thing .
and there was this little girl who was following me around .
thank you . thank you very much .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
`` the two words come from the latin root `` '' pater , '' '' which means `` '' father . '' '' but they mean two different things . ''
this should be the first principle of aid .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .

we have zero infrastructure .
peter drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
so what i 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
and in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : the city of new york would not exist in 100 years .
they were already drowning in manure . ( laughter ) so 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
`` now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography how many times richard uses the word `` '' i '' '' and how many times he uses the word `` '' we . '' '' never the word `` '' i , '' '' and the word `` '' we '' '' 32 times . ''
nobody started a company alone . no one .
now that 's a big claim . i 'm going to try to back it up .
slow , text-based conversations , then real-time voice based conversations .
this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .
but there is a curious asymmetry here .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
put another way , media is increasingly less just a source of information , and it is increasingly more a site of coordination , because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well .
people were texting from their phones . they were taking photos of buildings .
they were taking videos of buildings shaking .
for a while there the top 10 most clicked links on twitter , the global short messaging service — nine of the top 10 links were about the quake .
`` essentially to say , `` '' we will do anything to placate you , just please stop protesting in public . '' '' but these are people who have been radicalized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation . ''
and so they began to arrest the protesters .
the classic media problem , from the 20th century is , how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network .
media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
in a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .
and the choice we face , i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world , is n't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in .
`` even though it means changing the way we 've always done it . '' '' thank you very much . ''
of course there are other challenges — health care , disease burdens and pandemics , environmental challenges and , of course , radicalized terrorism .
in these countries , it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation .
if growth wanes , the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises , and societies become dimmer , coarser and smaller .
and countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries .
it 's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism .
and even this , however , is a very simplistic dichotomy .
and only after they 've maximized their utility do they then decide it 's important to provide support to other social contracts .
but also we 've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs .
my fundamental message to you is this : we can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological .
( applause ) bruno giussani : i want to ask a couple of questions , dambisa , because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology , it 's possibly the dominant ideology of our times .
i think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to .
so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television , or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers ' strike .
peter hirshberg : which is more fun , internet or tv ?
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
the next year they march forward and they introduce qube , the first interactive cable tv system , and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home , convergence , great things are happening .
by the way , this is about when i enter the picture .
that summer i 'm all — i 'm at warner that summer — i 'm all excited to work on convergence , and then the bottom falls out .
does n't work out too well for them , they lose money .
but they were onto something and they got better at it .
for 50 years , it 's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world . and i got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ?
and the answer is pretty clearly — it 's people in religion and in politics .
but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing .
would you like if i used the machine ?
since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research , why do n't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy 's research chief , admiral bolster , give whirlwind the workout ?
calvin bolster : well , ed , this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket .
and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman .
ph : you know , that one computer was huge .
you 'd kind of have to take century city out , but it could fit in there .
but it gives you the kind of power that people have , that the audience has , and the reasons these transformations are happening .
dec knew a good thing about wasting time .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
`` it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio , but i do n't know how . '' '' and of course , as the computer industry develops interactively , producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea . ''
( video ) jack berry : boys and girls , i think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set , you just get them out .
those are the winky dink crayons . i know what you 're saying .
( video ) mm : the global village is a world in which you do n't necessarily have harmony .
and so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
( video ) john markoff : do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs , sex , rock 'n ' roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors .
`` the title of the book is , `` '' what the dormouse said : how the '60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry . '' '' the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , `` '' remember what the dormouse said . ''
`` feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . '' '' ( music ) ph : by this time , computing had kind of leapt into media territory , and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley . ''
a prototyping tool ? a scripted language ?
( video ) james burke : you 'll be pleased to know , i 'm sure , that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video .
let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible .
the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell .
narrator : computers , once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks , escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas .
the world and all its culture reduced to bits , the lingua franca of all media .
voice 2 : next on the gourmet pet channel , decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .
if internet one was about pages , now it 's about people .
it 's a customer , it 's an audience , it 's a person who 's participating .
and then you have tv guide , a fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards — but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
( video ) man : yes , well , first , you know , i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group .
( video ) narrator : the following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m. , in the months preceding the presidential primaries .
voice 1 : you 'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
voices 2 , 3 and 4 : with her ?
ph : the company that created this , aniboom , is an interesting example of where this is headed . traditional tv animation costs , say , between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute .
but i do n't need to tell you this , let 's throw it back to him .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
they think of the old medium , because the old medium is always the content of the new medium , as movies tend to be the content of tv , and as books used to be the content , novels used to be the content of movies .
there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there . content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth , and part of social communications , and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what 's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
and actually , they 're very quickly becoming a reality .
gunpowder , cannon .
representative government began to form .
but time is a factor .
which brings us to , really , the third and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto weapons : plausible deniability .
now we live in a global economy .
cell phone geolocation , telecom metadata , social media , email , text , financial transaction data , transportation data , it 's a wealth of real-time data on the movements and social interactions of people .
what you 're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group .
this is no different .
so i use my imagination as my full-time job .
when i was a kid , i loved to draw , and the most talented artist i knew was my mother , but my mother was addicted to heroin .
but i had my grandparents , my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley , who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own , after they had already raised five children .
he ran and worked in a factory .
and i just , i can just remember the love that she offered us as her students .
an author visited our school , jack gantos .
writing is using your imagination on paper , and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids , that writing would be using your imagination on paper , if they 're allowed to even write now within the school hours .
so i loved writing so much that i 'd come home from school , and i would take out pieces of paper , and i would staple them together , and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because i loved using my imagination .
and my grandfather , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing i had . i did n't play sports .
`` now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook , and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in , i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time . ( laughter ) and to this day , i still can do karaoke to `` '' ice , ice baby '' '' without looking at the screen . ''
very wise man , because he knew i would , i felt like i was making the decision on my own , and he knew i would n't choose st. john 's , so i went to holy name high school , which was a tough transition because , like i said , i did n't play sports , and it was very focused on sports , but i took solace in mr. shilale 's art room .
well , in english class , in ninth grade , my friend john , who was sitting next to me , laughed a little bit too hard .
`` my grandfather 's just going to kill me . '' '' and he came out to the hallway and he said , `` let me see the paper . '' ''
`` just stop drawing in my class . '' '' so my parents never found out about it . ''
and i took the headmaster to task and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley who was unlucky in love , and i just swore up and down that this was n't about me , but all these years later it was totally me .
on the evening of my 14th birthday , i was given this table , and we had chinese food .
`` and all the color just drained from his face , and he looked at me , and he said , `` forget everything you learned . '' ''
the kid had no patience for him .
and i sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time , but i was also involved with the hole in the wall gang camp , an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses , and it 's those kids at the camp that read my stories , and i read to them , and i saw that they responded to my work .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
`` and i said , `` '' yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children 's books . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , who pays you for that ? '' '' and i said , `` '' no one , no one , no one just yet . ''
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo . ( laughter ) you know ? you only get one birthday per year .
and i get the most amazing fan mail , and i get the most amazing projects , and the biggest moment for me came last halloween .
thank you . ( applause )
i have no idea if you 're seeing this , but i 'm just going to look ahead and trust that you 're there .
`` and she looked at it and said , `` proof of concept — creation needs constraint . '' ''
so with these 12 minutes , i 'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery .
and new tehran in the sea of tranquility .
it was incredible .
she had a genius for it .
more than anything , they did n't want to be around her actual physical body .
`` i remember a friend of ours , just before we left , said , `` '' i just think it 's arrogant , like the rules do n't apply to you , like you think your love is that special . '' '' but i did . ''
( laughter ) asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age .
as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you 'd be wise to do something about that .
can you see your zodiac sign there ?
we even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations .
that means another one million more babies .
the collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything , from health care and education to property and consumer goods .
( applause )
now , what you ca n't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules , and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off .
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
now , since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors , we 've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors , and we 've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies .
the other third did n't lie , or perhaps forgot , or you 're lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . ( laughter ) this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
but they 're very special . they use ambiguity that comes from using technology . you do n't know where i am or what i 'm doing or who i 'm with .
and of course , you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r.j. ellory .
now , let 's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i 'm sure none of you have been in .
those are the conversations that really matter .
here 's a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media .
again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most , and perhaps because of the butler lie ambiguities i was telling you about .
then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person 's personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
they are clustering pretty close to the truth . what we found was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions , but they always lied by a little bit .
that 's really bad . why is it so bad ?
well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose .
most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes . the eyes are the window to the soul .
the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not .
all right . very good . about half .
all right . slightly more for b .
this is n't a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging .
but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives , i think we can go back to diogenes and confucius . and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie , and more concerned about being true to the self , and i think this is really important .
thank you so much for your time , and good luck with your record . ( applause )
you can smell them . you can get a feel for them .
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world , and more and more , i was sitting in front of my computer screen .
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality .
so if there was this world and this screen , and if there was the physical world around me , i could n't ever get them together in the same place .
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . ( laughter ) and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
`` they say , `` '' of course not , the internet does n't weigh anything . '' '' and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for . ''
the internet was that amorphous blob , or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it .
and then they connect to the continent somewhere .
this is in halifax , a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland .
now there are six cables and more coming , three down each coast .
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables , one across the atlantic and one across the pacific , and proceeded to add pieces onto them , until they had built a belt around the world , which means they will send your bits to the east or the west .
they have — this is literally a beam of light around the world , and if a cable breaks in the pacific , it 'll send it around the other direction . and then having done that , they started to look for places to wire next .
and first they got it with a hacksaw , and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a — sort of working like chefs , and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down , and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud .
you see the local laborers . you see the english engineer giving directions in the background . and more importantly , the places are the same . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , mumbai , singapore , new york .
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud , but every time we put something on the cloud , we give up some responsibility for it .
we are less connected to it . we let other people worry about it .
and that does n't seem right .
in the next decade ?
can we end hunger , achieve gender equality , halt climate change , all in the next 15 years ?
but not with business as usual .
this year , global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent .
but that ai n't easy , because the global goals are n't just ambitious , they 're also pretty complicated .
also , while some of the goals are pretty specific — end hunger — others are a lot vaguer — promote peaceful and tolerant societies .
what this does is measures all the stuff the global goals are trying to achieve , but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time .
secondly , does everyone have the building blocks of a better life : education , information , health and a sustainable environment ?
now , the global goals are certainly ambitious , but they 're not about turning the world into norway in just 15 years .
and what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth and social progress .
and in there , i 'm now going to put all the countries of the world , each one represented by a dot , and on top of that i 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship .
well , maybe not .
so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress , and this is what our last forecast was based on .
well , let 's look at some numbers .
certainly not with business as usual .
if we 're going to achieve the global goals we have to do things differently .
and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that , called the people 's report card .
unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
this is why it’s happening .
by 2050 , there’ll be about 32 million people in the united states over the age of 80 , and unless we do something about it , half of them will have alzheimer’s disease and three million more will have parkinson’s disease .
so one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
there’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers .
and there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , i’m afraid .
if you want to lower your risk of parkinson’s disease , caffeine is protective to some extent ; nobody knows why .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about something kind of big .
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day .
it wiped out 75 percent of all species on earth .
here is one that came in over the united states in october of 1992 .
now , you would n't want that falling on your foot or your head , because it would do that to it .
if you look up at the top , that 's a parking lot , and those are recreational vehicles right there .
the object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of mackey auditorium here .
this was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation .
another rock came into the earth 's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the earth .
in meteor crater it was made of metal , and metal is much tougher , so it made it to the ground .
if one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic .
this is a potential threat .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona 50,000 years ago .
they 're hard to see , and the sky is really big .
well , let me ask you , what happens if you 're standing in the middle of the road and a car 's headed for you ? what do you do ? you do this .
the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about .
we shot a space probe at it and hit it . okay ?
imagine how hard that must be , and we did it .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it 's very hard to do .
i think even nasa can do that , and they proved that they can . ( laughter ) the problem is , what happens if you hit this asteroid , you 've changed the orbit , you measure the orbit and then you find out , oh , yeah , we just pushed it into a keyhole , and now it 's going to hit us in three years .
instead you get near it .
there are these giant rocks flying out there , and they 're hitting us , and they 're doing damage to us , but we 've figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
`` they 're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive . '' '' yeah , we have an ion drive now . ( laughter ) we do n't have the enterprise , but we 've got an ion drive now . ''
it does n't have to happen to us .
( laughter ) we have the ability to change our future .
while we 're doing bailouts , this is what happened .
imagine the timing , the coordination , all without top-down laws , or policies , or climate change protocols .
and like , knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up .
how did he not know — it 's what we 've all forgotten — that we 're not the first ones to build .
we 're not the first ones to build houses for our young .
so these people , biomimics , are nature 's apprentices .
he happened to be a birder .
and he studied — there was a film about king fishers .
without a splash , so they can see the fish .
how does nature repel bacteria ?
10 times better than our fog-catching nets .
we take water and push it against a membrane .
a company called aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology .
energy use . organisms sip energy , because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get .
swarm technology . there is a company called regen .
they are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive .
amazon electric eel — incredibly endangered , some of these species — create 600 volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body .
and it 's based on the cochlear of your ear , able to pick up internet , wireless , television signals and radio signals , in the same chip .
we 're looking at building whole cities in their planning department .
`` the question i would ask is , `` '' what 's worth solving ? '' '' if you have n't seen this , it 's pretty amazing . ''
and inside those balls life , over 3.8 billion years , has made a lush , livable place for us .
and so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation — creating things that live on , in or around the human form — it 's really a powerful space to work within .
and i called it the muttering hat , because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you , but you could detach them and share them with somebody else .
( laughter ) it 's fairly self-explanatory .
so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst .
( laughter ) and some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .
and so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic , because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i 'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
and so i actually live in canada now , so i 've been visiting one of my local glaciers .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , i actually made a device called the glacier embracing suit .
for one thing , both were very real .
i do n't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet — like getrich.com .
some have 5,000. many have more .
so many people left what they were doing .
`` people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , `` '' ah , this is n't real . '' '' but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it 's not real . ''
`` by about 1852 , they 're thinking , `` '' am i the stupidest person on earth by not rushing to california ? '' '' and they start to decide they are . ''
these were typically not solitary efforts . but no matter what , if you were a lawyer or a banker , people dropped what they were doing , no matter what skill set they had , to go pan for gold .
this guy on the left , dr. richard beverley cole , he lived in philadelphia and he took the panama route .
half of them deserted to go look for gold .
so the light bulb is what wired the world .
and they were n't thinking about appliances when they wired the world .
all the streets had to be torn up .
and they 're tearing up all the streets .
how could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people were n't really investing in the web ?
by the way , this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit .
but three years later , by 1908 , it weighed 40 pounds .
now , not all these things were highly successful .
all the appliances plug in there . and you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance .
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines .
and there 's a rotor there — that this motor is spinning .
and it would clean your clothes .
and this was a big deal .
and as i said before , they had n't invented the electric outlet either , so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device .
and you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this .
this is what it looks like under my desk .
i know ph.d.s in computer science — this process has brought them to tears , absolute tears . ( laughter ) and that 's assuming you already have dsl in your house .
and if you believe that , then you believe that where we are — this is what i think — i believe that where we are with the incredible kludge — and i have n't even talked about user interfaces on the web — but there 's so much kludge , so much terrible stuff — we are at the 1908 hurley washing machine stage with the internet .
`` 1998 : `` '' amazon.toast . '' '' in 1999 : `` '' amazon.bomb . '' '' my mom hates this picture . ''
( laughter ) she — but you know , if you really do believe that it 's the very , very beginning , if you believe it 's the 1908 hurley washing machine , then you 're incredibly optimistic . and i do think that that 's where we are .
yes , your happy place , i know you 've got one even if it 's fake .
any plastic tables ?
polyester flooring ?
mobile phones ?
a fork is a simple tool .
i think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens .
for example , i love books .
your phone is not the internet 's door bitch .
next i worked with the japanese agency , aq , on a research project into mental health .
this is incredibly simple , it 's like your opal card .
and we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year .
humans need simple tools .
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from .
`` `` '' the worlds are the important thing . ''
actually you do n't .
thank you so much . it was an honor to be here .
so it allows it to roll .
it 's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave .
representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two .
and here is a similar sculpture .
that 's the sun at that end .
it weighs about a ton or over a ton .
and the blue side , the compliment , faces the other way .
this is a clock i designed .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
it can generate about a million kilowatts , in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
`` twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , `` '' i exist . '' '' then i went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say , `` '' they exist . '' '' from the suburbs of paris to the wall of israel and palestine , the rooftops of kenya to the favelas of rio , paper and glue — as easy as that . ''
and we keep sending more every day .
these are the people i want to talk about to you today .
karachi , pakistan .
north dakota . standing rock nation , in this turtle island , [ unclear name ] from the dakota lakota tribe wanted to show that the native americans are still here .
here they even got the help of the firemen .
you go on the back of that truck , it takes your photo , 30 seconds later take it from the side , you 're ready to rock .
`` `` '' what is life ? '' '' is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels . ''
we 've tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
when we look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple compared to ours — trust me , this is simple — but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species — roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice — we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell — and you 'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
and i 've argued that we 're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion , where there 's massive new speciation based on this digital design .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there 'll be four .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we 're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
we 're looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
`` so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of `` '' what is life ? '' '' we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry — ( laughter ) ( applause ) yeah . if you ca n't do that at ted , where can you ? — ( laughter ) become a major source of energy ... ''
car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the united states — leading cause of death — and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol .
so what happens ?
it was just going 65 — to zero ?
stop looking where you 're going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you 're going .
why do we do this ? because we have to , we have to make a choice , do i look here or do i look here ?
and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road .
you may think that 's impossible .
it 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car 's going to be in the near future .
i can tell you exactly what happens .
we 're now adding more and more robots into the mix , and we encountered some problems .
and we wanted to do — how can we best alert everyone ?
( laughter ) and i think it 's going to be a great thing .
as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation — in the '80s — of students who were protesting a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .
but what i 've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says , the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
i should tell you some stories about remarkable people , so i thought i 'd start with my mother .
`` ( laughter ) and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had chad , the surfer dude , serving us , and he came up and my mother said , `` do you have any specials , young man ? '' ''
it takes her one year , through refugee camp after refugee camp , to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country .
all through that one year , my mother never cried one time , not once .
`` and i remember years later , i was writing about my mother , and i asked her , `` '' why did you cry then ? '' '' and she said , `` '' you know , you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble , any kind of horror . ''
but today , women are rebuilding rwanda .
which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .
and i was this weird , sensitive kid , who could n't really do it , but i had to do it .
now , when i was growing up , he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people , and their intestines would fall out , but they would keep running .
i cried for a very long time .
`` just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult . '' '' of course , talking about goats makes me think of sheep , and not in good ways . ''
`` and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said , `` it 's all right daphne , i 'm scottish . '' ( laughter ) ''
and i 'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale .
i selected 2,000 years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there .
the tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art , science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on .
and — perhaps naively — i was surprised to find that there is n't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity .
visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north .
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it , though luckily , they lost interest before killing it .
this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees , living in utah , that is literally 80,000 years old .
so what you have is one giant , interconnected , genetically identical individual that 's been living for 80,000 years .
it also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
this is the spruce gran picea , which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods .
however , it died in the lab as they were determining its age .
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you 'll remember it 's actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
it 's around 2,000 , and it 's called the sagole baobab .
it 's a primitive conifer .
i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from , and his thought was that if you travel around namibia , you see that there are a number of petrified forests , and the logs are all — the logs are all giant coniferous trees , and yet there 's no sign of where they might have come from .
so , now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .
( applause )
children with cleft palates get it , and they document their story .
and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer .
so , moving on swiftly .
there 's a lot of information here .
in case people think i 'm trying to replicate the real thing .
and as it resolves , and as cyril goes deeper , you can see all the self-portraits , you can see still life .
`` so let 's take you and let 's travel through `` '' the bedroom '' '' very quickly , so you can experience what we are doing for every single object . ''
so i started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them .
moving on from here very quickly , there is kind of a playful idea , actually , to illustrate the point of access , and i 'm going to go quite quickly on this one .
but essentially , we have around 1,000 amazing institutions , 68 countries .
but let 's start with rembrandt .
all that we 've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections .
what if it could automatically tag them , using no actual metadata ?
and we found interesting categories .
you would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses , right ?
and the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids .
this is where i come from , todmorden .
it 's called vegetable tourism , and believe it or not , people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds , even when there 's not much growing . ( laughter ) but it starts a conversation . ( laughter ) and , you know , we 're not doing it because we 're bored . ( laughter ) we 're doing it because we want to start a revolution .
and then , can we replicate those actions ?
and the answer would appear to be yes , and the language would appear to be food .
we did not consult . we did not write a report .
i have never , ever experienced anything like that in my life .
`` this is about us going to the people and saying , `` '' we are all part of the local food jigsaw , we are all part of a solution . '' '' and then , because we know we 've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they 're absolutely fantastic , we thought , what could we do to give them an even better experience ? ''
people after the earthquake in new zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of christchurch .
there are so many things you can do , but ultimately this is about something really simple .
through an organic process , through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions , we are starting , at last , to believe in ourselves again , and to believe in our capacity , each and every one of us , to build a different and a kinder future , and in my book , that 's incredible .
`` and i look at her , and i say , `` '' now , do n't you think we need more than one black person in the u.s . senate ? '' '' now harold and i — ( applause ) — we still laugh about that story , and in many ways , the moment caught me off guard , but deep , deep down inside , i actually was n't surprised . ''
and i was n't surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before .
i was seven . i did not understand .
now , race is one of those topics in america that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable .
we can not afford to be color blind .
now i can tell you , in my own industry , at ariel investments , we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage , and that advantage can extend way beyond business .
i 'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally .
invite people into your life who do n't look like you , do n't think like you , do n't act like you , do n't come from where you come from , and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person .
when we got evicted , sometimes we lived in these small apartments that she owned , sometimes in only one or two rooms , because they were n't completed , and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates .
as citizens , i 'm asking you not to leave any child behind .
`` my mother could not read or write , but she would say to me , `` '' a king is worshipped only in his own kingdom . a poet is respected everywhere . '' '' so i wanted to be a poet when i grew up . ''
if there was a country made up of only international migrants , that would be larger , in population , than brazil .
those sums of money are called remittances .
migrants from developing countries , money sent to developing countries — 413 billion dollars .
that decline in poverty , most of it , about half of it , is believed to be because of remittances from india , another poor country .
remittances are dollars wrapped with care .
foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
the global average cost of sending money is eight percent .
to send money within africa , the cost is even higher : over 20 percent .
monthly remittances , on average , to somalia is larger than that amount .
so , what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home ?
for that matter , between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor .
the development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent .
i was in dubai a few years ago .
she takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent , while the children are looking on .
this has to stop .
most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
increasingly , i feel like a global citizen .
my brothers and sisters have moved on .
and yet , from time to time , i send money home to friends , to relatives , to the village , to be there , to stay engaged — that 's part of my identity .
( applause )
but somewhere as the years passed , someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit .
but designers , innovators and entrepreneurs , it 's our job to not just notice those things , but to go one step further and try to fix them .
it was a cold , wet , snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar .
when he opened the window , though , he let all this cold , wet air inside , making all the passengers miserable .
but you know what ?
when it had batteries in it , you had to charge it before you used it .
typically , when you have a product that has a hard drive in it , you run it for about 30 minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive 's going to be working years later for the customer after they pull it out of the box .
thermostat designers decided to add a new step .
now that seemed great .
but it turned out that no one saved any energy .
so here is a complete picture of the universe about 14-odd billion years ago .
and so what you 're watching is the birth of stars .
( laughter ) and as you take a close-up of this galaxy , you find a relatively normal , not particularly interesting star .
so within that context , there 's two theories of the case as to why we 're all here .
and if it is — and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
( laughter ) well , why would one ask a question like that ?
we found this one last year .
we found another one last month .
this explains most contemporary political debates .
and when we find these , we may find differences .
and we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the united states , except that with the technologies that are coming online today , today 's corrections , deletions , augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child 's play .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
and as you think of that , what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells .
and this might have just one or two small ethical , political , moral implications .
because these technologies are moving really quickly .
and this is only one of the conditions that 's out there .
you 've got all kinds of stuff going on out there , and we still do n't understand how and why this is happening .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
there really needs to be more research on this .
one option is the fast food fetish .
so this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures .
here 's the bottom line .
and i did n't think this when steve gullans and i started writing together .
i think we 're transitioning into homo evolutis that , for better or worse , is not just a hominid that 's conscious of his or her environment , it 's a hominid that 's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species , of bacteria , of plants , of animals .
this photo was taken just before they left from italy to immigrate to the united states , just about a century ago .
this is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
it 's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city , and it almost feels like you 're indiana jones on an archaeological dig , and all the details are all still there .
so what we 're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
i 'm not a vegetarian — this is the old nixon line , right ?
but i still think that this — ( laughter ) — may be this year 's version of this .
and why do i say it ?
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .
nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production — more than transportation .
the current health crisis , however , is a little more the work of the evil empire .
we were told , we were assured , that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate , the healthier we 'd be .
the evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
incredible , is n't it ?
and they do this here . it 's the same deal .
so , when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encouraged us , via their overly simplistic food pyramid , to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day , along with more carbs .
so-called low-fat diets , so-called low-carb diets — these are not solutions .
i like animals , and i do n't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches .
now , my math 's a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
`` another red herring might be exemplified by the word `` '' locavore , '' '' which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary . ''
everyone was a locavore : even new york had pig farms nearby , and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion .
it was like your romantic vision of europe .
you just ate .
there were no health claims , at least not federally sanctioned ones .
hardly anything contained more than one ingredient , because it was an ingredient .
the cornflake had n't been invented .
( laughter ) the pop-tart , the pringle , cheez whiz , none of that stuff .
who needed it though ? meat was everywhere .
meat consumption increased five-fold .
home cooking remained the norm , but its quality was down the tubes .
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
others worshiped broccoli , as if it were god-like .
but mostly they did n't eat broccoli .
we need to start acting .
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
but , no , even if we were all steroid-filled football players , the answer is no .
it would seem absurd , but that 's exactly what should happen , and what progressive people , forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating , along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants .
eat real food .
we can continue to enjoy our food , and we continue to eat well , and we can eat even better .
but then i got my first taste of lighting .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
i actually have icons of lights i move around in there .
as light travels deeper into the water , we lose the red wavelengths , then the green wavelengths , leaving us with blue at the far depths .
the first is the surge and swell , or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water .
here we have the fog beams .
as humans we have the white of our eye , the colored iris and the black pupil .
now wall-e has the black of an eye , the gray aperture blades and the black pupil .
suddenly , wall-e feels like he has a soul , like there 's a character with emotion inside .
( video ) wall-e : eva ?
there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together .
i gave my intro , and i played the jellyfish scene .
( laughter ) so i 've been busy with a couple of projects , and one of them was this : the nutmeg .
and it appears that , some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night , until she reappeared in the morning .
stefan von bergen : well , he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side .
that means about 190 miles per hour .
so it 's really a play between these two approaches .
yr : it was down on the bottom .
so i fought my way off my label , and for my next project with my new band , the grand theft orchestra , i turned to crowdfunding .
and so , for the past six years , i 've made it my personal mission to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications .
the damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
you 've got a cas9 protein and something called a guide rna .
it 's an ok way to maybe , like , knock out a gene , but it 's not the way that we really want to do genome editing .
the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting .
`` i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like , `` '' hey , can i come to your open night and , like , maybe use crispr and engineer my genome ? '' '' ( laugher ) like , seriously . ''
so , how cheap is it ?
that 's great .
well , it 's cheap if you 're doing basic research and you 've got a lab .
the devil is always in the details .
so : is it really easy ?
or even an extra leg — i 'd settle for an extra leg .
that would be kind of cool , right ?
this is the story of crispr we should be telling , and i do n't like it that the flashier aspects of it are drowning all of this out .
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .
they have trademark protection , but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of .
that 's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products .
canal street , i know .
but too utilitarian ? i mean is that the way you think of fashion ?
some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear , but if you talk to any designer at any level , including these high-end designers , they always say their main inspiration comes from the street : where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks .
now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .
and , you know , a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design , at least in terms of the materials ; they 're always made of cheaper materials .
but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects , can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .
they do n't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .
now of course , there 's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process .
in japan , for instance , which i think is the third largest market , they have a design law ; it protects apparel , but the novelty standard is so high , you have to prove that your garment has never existed before , it 's totally unique .
are nike t-shirts that are almost identical to one another .
open source software , these guys decided they did n't want copyright protection .
or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea : something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?
if you want more information about this research project , please visit our website : it 's readytoshare.org .
i 'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
that 's what they had all their lives .
and so this kid was probably abused , abandoned , ignored , betrayed by almost every adult along the way .
and that 's how they develop self-esteem .
now , let me give you an example of how it works .
you stand with your bike at the beginning of february .
in every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations , taking in this incredible landscape around me , and i feel blessed and fortunate that i 'm alive , and that i sense every fiber in my aching body .
( applause )
it sure used to be a lot easier to be from iceland , because until a couple of years ago , people knew hardly anything about us , and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us .
first , of course , the economic meltdown .
it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay .
why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ?
`` we were n't known as the typical `` '' women '' '' women in iceland up until then . ''
and we got a great group of people to join us — principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours .
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that — and also there 's a factor of luck and timing — we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
not a complicated thing .
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table .
so what do you get ? you get better decision-making , and you get less herd behavior , and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results .
and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious , and they are going to start voting with their wallets , and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside , if they do n't do it from the inside .
( laughter ) they marched into the center of reykjavik , and they put women 's issues onto the agenda .
and at one of the campaign sessions , she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she could n't become president — she was a woman , and even half a woman .
`` that night she won the election , because she came back — not just because of his crappy behavior — but she came back and said , `` '' well , i 'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation ; i 'm going to lead it . '' '' ( applause ) so i 've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who i am and where i am today . ''
we need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
i worried that i would regret an abortion later .
it 's political and polarizing .
there is a gap .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
there are two main ways to get started .
we needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk-line .
it also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends .
listening and storytelling .
another way to be a good listener is to use reflective language .
over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth . saying the word god did not turn this volunteer into a christian , but it did make her a much better listener of christian women . so , another way to be pro-voice is to share stories , and one risk that you take on , when you share your story with someone else , is that given the same set of circumstances as you
and while pregnant , i had never been asked how i was feeling so much in all my life .
it was a welcome , yet dramatic departure from what i experience when i talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion .
pro-voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues are understood and discussed .
and at three months , he joined me .
just as i was about to start my final exams , i decided to take a break from an all-nighter and go to a lecture by dr. paul farmer , a leading health activist for the global poor .
and what about the patients ' experience ?
and we 're convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world , and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture .
in butaro , we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area , but often considered a nuisance by farmers , and piled on the side of the road .
`` so i sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : `` '' dear bryan , '' '' it said , `` '' i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice . ''
needless to say , i canceled all my meetings and i jumped on a plane to montgomery , alabama .
and just outside will be a field of identical columns .
but these are temporary columns , waiting in purgatory , to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred .
when we think about how it should be built , we were reminded of ubudehe , the building process we learned about in rwanda .
`` as one eji team member noted in the collection of the soil from where will mcbride was lynched , `` '' if will mcbride left one drop of sweat , one drop of blood , one hair follicle — i pray that i dug it up , and that his whole body would be at peace . '' '' we plan to break ground on this memorial later this year , and it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation . ''
they make visible our personal and our collective aspirations as a society .
and if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the hubble space telescope , it will see something like this .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
what that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
the thing that does n't make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , near the big bang , was also very , very smooth .
`` you might say , `` '' well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . '' '' but the conditions near the big bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room . ''
the gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the big bang .
we would like to know what .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .
and boltzmann 's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
boltzmann gave us a formula — engraved on his tombstone now — that really quantifies what entropy is .
this insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what 's behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future .
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .
50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures .
`` we want to know — this is 50 years ago , `` '' surely , '' '' you 're thinking , `` we 've figured it out by now . '' ''
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we do n't know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that 's the theory of dark energy .
because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands .
so boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
he did n't know about the big bang . he did n't know about the expansion of the universe .
and then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back .
remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
if our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it .
( laughter ) here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
`` you might say , `` '' well there 's nothing there to be living , '' '' but that 's not right . ''
`` an egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , `` '' hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . '' '' that 's because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken . ''
and 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .
in the western world , divorce rates are about 40 percent .
that means that out of five married couples , two will end up splitting their assets .
and even divorce lawyers , who should really know better , hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce .
out of four british people , three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families .
the optimism bias has been observed in many different countries — in western cultures , in non-western cultures , in females and males , in kids , in the elderly .
but the question is , is it good for us ?
and they found that when people with high expectations succeed , they attribute that success to their own traits .
`` `` '' i 'm a genius , therefore i got an a , therefore i 'll get an a again and again in the future . '' '' when they failed , it was n't because they were dumb , but because the exam just happened to be unfair . ''
the behavioral economist george lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity , any celebrity .
they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
now they were n't willing to wait a year or 10 years ; no one wants an aging celebrity .
optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics .
but this is not what we find .
we asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives .
and it 's not that they did n't remember the numbers that we gave them ; everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about 30 percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent .
what i wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally .
and using a method called functional mri , we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information .
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on .
and at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves , would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits ?
the key here really is knowledge .
because if you 're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly , you certainly never will .
thank you .
and here 's her poem .
`` the next poem is `` '' if no one ever marries me . '' '' it was written by laurence alma-tadema . ''
i became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them , and started to research their lives , and then decided to write a book about it .
and the answer was no , which i found in the london times archive .
he became a jesuit .
he was moved to by the tractarian movement , the oxford movement , otherwise known as — and he became a jesuit priest .
♫ they 're all the same . ♫ ♫ nor mouth had nor no mind expressed ♫ ♫ what heart heard of , ghost had guessed : ♫ ♫ it 's the blight man was born for , ♫ ♫ it is margaret that you mourn for ♫ thank you so much .
( applause ) ( music ) i 'd like to thank everybody , all the scientists , the philosophers , the architects , the inventors , the biologists , the botanists , the artists ...
thank you .
♫ well , you 've been so ... ♫ that 's innovative , do n't you think ?
this is a provocative question .
you think about it for a minute , and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like : what is a computer ?
so up here , we have two poems .
ok , most of you .
pearls , / harmonicas , jujubes , aspirins ! all / the stuff they 've always talked about ( ... ) alright , time 's up .
we have , more or less , a 50/50 split here .
( laughter ) so what we 've just done now is a turing test for poetry .
well , yes , absolutely it can .
so you 'd be surprised to find that poem 1 was written by the very human poet gertrude stein .
so what do we take from all of this ?
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
and in libby , montana , there 's a rather unusual woman named gayla benefield .
it did n't make sense that gayla 's mother should die so young .
so now she had an ally .
`` it 's lined with vermiculite . '' '' this was n't ignorance . ''
they 're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for , and the reason that they speak up , the reason they insist on seeing , is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy .
`` ignorance is bliss , they say , but you ca n't put up with things like this . '' '' i talked to steve bolsin , a british doctor , who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies . ''
`` and she said to me , she said , `` '' you know , margaret , i always used to say i did n't know what i wanted to be when i grow up . ''
when i went to libby , montana , i visited the asbestosis clinic that gayla benefield brought into being , a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they did n't want to acknowledge that she 'd been right .
i took my 12-year-old daughter with me , because i really wanted her to meet gayla .
( laughter ) okay , speaker lawrence lessig , right .
`` `` '' ... youngest republican , '' '' okay , we 're finished . ''
great , here we go .
they go to church , by which i mean , they do lots of things for free for each other .
they share , they give , they give away for free .
and it 's the very same people leading wall street firms who , on sundays , show up and share .
they are in many important places against markets .
indeed , they , like all of us , celebrate this kind of relationship .
okay , so julian made this video .
so here he is beginning .
larry lessig : so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos .
( music ) and then some people from brooklyn saw it .
all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression .
ll : right . bingo . point .
freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture .
and for that to happen , you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected , to enable this kind of innovation , as this libertarian tells us , between these two creative cultures , a commercial and a sharing culture .
now , tiny little quibble of a footnote : sonny bono , you might say , was a republican , but i do n't buy it .
`` look at the site that he built : `` '' star wars '' '' mashups , inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon . ''
indeed , anything you add to the mashup , music you might add , lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free .
the creator is a sharecropper in this story .
freedom , which means without permission from anyone , the ability to create .
you could still buy the music , but you could n't hear anything because it had been silenced .
`` `` '' i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair . ''
it 's a value of the limits in regulation .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
this is about a 5,000-year-old technology .
wow , what a powerful question .
you know , as a scientist — planetary scientist — we really did n't take that very seriously until recently .
it 's liquid water .
so what are we going to do now — now that we see the water ?
in its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere — there was an ocean .
liquid water on its surface .
it has all the right conditions .
we 're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on mars .
this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone , this area around the sun .
cassini was there since 2006 , and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all .
it must come from the ocean floor .
these moons , which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone , that are out in the solar system , have liquid water .
this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that for billions of years .
if there 's any place in the solar system where life is not like us , where the substitute of water is another solvent — and it could be methane — it could be titan .
right ?
and so there 's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
she 'd run ahead , and he 'd roll a little golden apple .
just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message .
( laughter ) but as you 're thinking about narcissus , just do n't fall in love with your own reflection .
and that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
( applause )
if you are well-versed with inches , nine inches , centimeters , 16 [ centimeters ] .
so , welcome to the golden desert .
it 's called kunds ; somewhere it is called [ unclear ] .
and this is pure drinking water .
another big one , this is of course out of the hardcore desert area .
it can break sometimes .
you can see person coming up with two canisters of water .
( laughter ) but we will come back , once again , to the traditional thing .
or , if you want to paint , you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms .
and it 's a kind of water body for all seasons .
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned , so water will be there for seven months or nine months , or 12 months .
this year they have received only six centimeters .
do n't spit , do n't do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
this was done in 11th century .
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words , so we can say a thousand words right now , an another thousand words .
so , throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure .
so , you can find through your jeep , a camel , and a cart .
these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides .
these are the trees .
so , this is the message of desert .
so , the ponds , the open bodies , are everywhere , right from sri lanka to kashmir , and in other parts also .
one recharge , and one stores .
i 'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy .
and then you extract them out of the ground , and sell them on the open marketplace .
they just care about three things and three things only : price , price and price .
now , there 's an antidote to commoditization , and that is customization .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy .
time to go beyond the goods and the services , and use , in that same heuristic , what happens when you customize a service ?
and the question is n't really so much a question as an accusation .
so much has that happened that i 've developed a fairly praticed response , which is : i point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience .
even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods , there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods ; there 's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods .
( laughter ) and the dutch , they always go ...
it 's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows .
it 's about supply and availability .
with the service economy , it is about improving quality .
that has — the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years .
because all businesses are man-made objects ; all business is involved with money ; all business is a matter of using machinery , and all those things make something inauthentic .
`` when you think about that , let me go back to what lionel trilling , in his seminal book on authenticity , `` '' sincerity and authenticity '' '' — came out in 1960 — points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon , if you will . ''
and it doth follow , as night the day , that thou canst not then be false to any man .
and i do n't know about you , but whenever i encounter two dimensions , i immediately go , ahh , two-by-two !
it is what it says it is : it 's universal studio ; it 's in the city of los angeles ; you 're going to walk a lot .
right ? you do n't tend to walk a lot in los angeles , well , here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot , outside in this city .
right ? it 's not what it says it is . it 's not really the magic kingdom .
( laughter ) but it is — oh , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to — ( laughter ) — sorry .
and what you have done in the past limits what you can do , what you can get away with , essentially , in the future .
that 's one of the reasons why they 're having such trouble today , and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner .
so , understand what — your past limits what you can do in the future .
right , if you could check into the ads , you 'd have a great experience .
( laughter ) but unfortunately , you have to experience the actual hotel , airline and hospital , and then you have that disconnect .
two or three cents per cup — that 's what coffee is worth .
take that same good , and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer , in a corner diner , in a bodega , a kiosk somewhere , you get 50 cents , maybe a buck per cup of coffee .
my lower half is appearing at a different conference ( laughter ) in a different country .
but still , i 'm sorry i ca n't be with you in person .
and though i 'm a rock star , i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub .
if you wanted to make a film , you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget .
big skies , big hearts , big , shining continent .
`` anyway , on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said , `` would you take my son with you ? '' ''
it was the middle of that awful famine .
that 's not a cause . that 's an emergency .
the right to live like a human .
look at the response to the tsunami — it 's inspiring .
it mocks our pieties . it doubts our concern .
africa is a continent in flames .
you see , it 's not as dramatic as the tsunami .
do n't you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology ?
and i say that as a fan , you know ?
what on earth can we all do about this ?
well , much more than we think .
forget the '60s . we can change the world .
it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier , headier days .
most of you started out wanting to change the world , did n't you ?
it is a pain in the arse .
do we have the will ?
last year at data , this organization i helped set up , we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty .
we 're calling it the one campaign .
because we also need your intellectual capital : your ideas , your skills , your ingenuity .
and we 'd like you to give us that energy .
the war against terror , yes .
some say we ca n't afford to . i say we ca n't afford not to .
( laughter ) this business , it gets to be addictive , you know what i mean , when somebody else is picking up the tab .
i believe it 's possible .
we ca n't afford to be cool and sit this one out .
if there 's one million americans — and i really know this — who are ready to make phone calls , who are ready to be on email , i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history , literally , for the continent of africa .
i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day .
please join us by working together .
we can start to make poverty history .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
it 's actually where it all started for me .
it was just nine years later that addis ababa was connected by phone to harare , which is 500 kilometers away .
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference .
thank you very much once again .
people are always asking me where i come from , and they 're expecting me to say india , and they 're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent of my blood and ancestry does come from india .
and their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole .
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and did n't have much chance of stepping outside of that .
no coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on earth is half-kenyan , partly raised in indonesia , has a chinese-canadian brother-in-law .
and of course , once you have new eyes , even the old sights , even your home become something different .
certainly when i 'm traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let 's say , a half-korean , half-german young woman living in paris .
and home , we know , is not just the place where you happen to be born .
the whole place was absolutely silent , but the silence was n't an absence of noise .
and the next day , when i woke up in the absence of telephones and tvs and laptops , the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours .
but movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
we just put a blind person in it and we 're done , right ?
so this is a chair — as a matter of fact , it 's actually a massage chair .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
well there comes the first box .
third box is out . the fourth box is out .
just imagine , in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what 's written and read using these non-visual interfaces .
( applause )
so now i want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war , and that is the eastern oyster .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
because if you have cleaner water and slower water , you can imagine a new way of living with that water .
here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
they were key in our culture and our economy .
basically , new york was built on the backs of oystermen , and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
many , many species depend on them .
how does the reef work ? well , it 's very , very simple .
the concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on .
so the water is churned through this raft .
thank you .
i have a very peculiar background , attitude and approach to the real world because i am a conjurer .
now , i prefer that term over magician , because if i were a magician , that would mean that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic .
and it makes a very bad microphone ; i 've tried it many times . ( laughter ) the other assumption that you made — and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
now , i have to do something — first of all , switch to real glasses so i can actually see you , which would probably be a convenience . i do n't know .
i have n't had a good look . well , it 's not that great a convenience .
i will take enough of these . mm .
i 'm an actor who plays a specific part .
and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems .
but it is a cruel , vicious , absolutely conscienceless — i 'll be all right , keep your seats ( laughter ) — game that these people play .
`` so what he says is , very often , is like this : he says , `` '' he tells me , he tells me , before he passed , that he had trouble breathing . '' '' folks , that 's what dying is all about ! ''
they do n't get any information , they do n't get any value for what they spend .
now , sylvia browne — just to show you — she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone , she does n't even go there in person , and you have to wait up to two years because she 's booked ahead that amount of time .
he just does n't care .
they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
now , i popped some pills earlier .
i have to explain that to you .
i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills .
it 's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
( laughter ) work on it . work on it .
i do n't know what we 're doing , believing in all this nonsense over all these years .
maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
she did accept and then backed away .
now , inspired by jill bolte taylor last year , i did n't bring a human brain , but i did bring a liter of bone marrow .
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
about 200 times usually .
so i 'm thinking , you know , this procedure has n't changed in about 40 years .
this is it .
and we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around .
so i did a few prototypes . i got a small little grant at stanford .
adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow , which we 've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years .
the hope is that this gets more stem cells out , which translates to better outcomes .
well , some of you are laughing . everybody laughs when i say that , but not on this train . silence .
i know it 's hispanic because she 's speaking spanish to her companion .
you know the thing that was so great about mark twain — you know we honor mark twain , but we do n't read him .
we read 'huck finn , ' of course , we read 'huck finn ' of course .
remember that great scene on the raft , remember what huck did ?
and the official truth , the truth was , the law was , that a black man was a property , was a thing , you see .
and he hears that jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them , and huck says , 'ooh , oh my god , ooh , ooh — that woman , that woman never did anybody any harm .
you know , most actors want to do characters that are likeable — well , not always , but the notion , especially at a conference like this , i like to inspire people .
`` but since this was called `` '' risk taking , '' '' i 'm doing somebody who i never do , because she 's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in . ''
and so he put her in the bathtub , and i was in the bedroom with the baby .
`` `` '' ok. ok ? ok. ok . ''
many african-americans probably think that they won by the trial .
he is the model of non-violence , non-violence — and they would all like to be in his spirit .
they fought for their rights for over two centuries , and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities , hispanic , asian , we would suffer more in the mainstream .
i wish that i could live together with black people .
igniting , igniting , igniting fire . igniting fire .
determination 's like , you 're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt .
i mean , i guess it just be like — i guess it be like the day my brother died .
but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time , that this was so central to the religious life .
and we need to revive that spirit .
we have to make this happen , and we can do it with the modern communications that ted has introduced .
i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people , which are dividing us from one another .
and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas .
you know , we wake up in the morning , you get dressed , put on your shoes , you head out into the world .
i get on . i tend to be a little bit vigilant when i get on the subway .
so he was there when i woke up , and it was , waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain .
like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you got ta get on with that .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you . very lucky to be here . thank you . ( applause )
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
but i would go in on occasion .
so the clock started ticking .
so you end up , number three , not swimming , in the case of freestyle , on your stomach , as many people think , reaching on top of the water .
so you do n't kick . but you do use a small flick .
then you see his left leg .
small flick , and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side .
and that will get you very far .
six months later i had the chance to go to japan .
i met my host family . things went quite well i think , all things considered .
i ended up being able to read asahi shinbu , asahi newspaper , about six months later — so a total of 11 months later — and went from japanese i to japanese vi .
someone who was terrible at languages , and at any given time , speak , read and write five or six .
i came up with these six sentences after much experimentation .
i looked a lot like an orangutan , our close cousins , or the incredible hulk .
she was very pissed off that i had pulled her from her advanced practice .
`` she came back . she goes , `` '' come on . i do n't have all day . '' '' as someone who wrestled since age eight , i proceeded to crush her , `` '' of mice and men '' '' style . ''
so i bought a month 's worth of classes .
so i had a very short deadline for a competition .
and then i took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
i interviewed these people because they all taught in buenos aires .
now the protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside , i found this very interesting . so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities .
i found that longer steps were much more elegant .
secondly , different types of pivots .
his name is gabriel misse .
so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
so then we broke it down .
`` and because of that fear , we tend to do one of two things : we go into denial : `` '' it 's not me , it has nothing to do with me , it 's never going to happen to me . '' '' or , we decide that we 're going to prevent dementia , and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it wo n't come and get us . ''
so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease .
my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's , and he 's kind and loving now .
even when it 's so hard .
and what i need now is to learn to be like that .
i do n't want to get alzheimer 's disease .
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
so , they got the frames from these big bikes , put them together with the gears from the racing bikes , got the brakes from motorcycles , and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients .
`` and for the first , i do n't know , three to five years of their life , mountain bikes were known as `` '' clunkers . '' '' and they were just made in a community of bikers , mainly in northern california . ''
that 's now possible ; you do n't need an organization to be organized , to achieve large and complex tasks , like innovating new software programs .
what 's the policy recommendation out of that if you 're in government , or you 're running a large company ?
more special people , more special places .
build creative clusters in cities ; create more r & d parks , so on and so forth .
all of our patents , our entire approach to patents and invention , is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for ; we can say what it 's for .
the truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative ; like wikipedia , it develops over a long period of time .
so what happens ? rap music is created by the users .
this has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life .
take astronomy as an example , which yochai has already mentioned .
over here , you 've got the old , traditional corporate model : special people , special places ; patent it , push it down the pipeline to largely waiting , passive consumers .
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding , because they 're threatened by them .
meant to be a way to incentivize invention , meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge , they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place .
that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come — will only come — from an open-source kind of project .
they want to , as jimmy said , they want to have a dialogue , a conversation .
if this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ?
and those organizational models , it turns out , are incredibly powerful , and the people who can understand them will be very , very successful .
nine thousand servers all over china , has 250 million subscribers .
because basically , he does n't service them .
but actually , a lot of the content is created by the users themselves .
if , for some reason , your credit card bounces , or there 's some other problem , you lose your character .
and that 's about it , that 's all they know .
and 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in america .
come with me to 915 south bloodworth street in raleigh , north carolina , where i grew up .
if you come in you will see us : evening time , at table — set for ten but not always all seats filled — at the point when dinner is ready to be served .
my task was , at least once a week , to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street , mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue , and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road .
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled , walking across the bridge and going into selma .
`` i know how you feel . '' '' and he said , `` '' i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did . ''
`` 'find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated , when we have been despised and rejected . ' and they all spoke out of their own traditions , a word about the healing power of solidarity , one with the other . '' '' i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature , but i became a preacher . ''
how do you make it real ?
compassion takes on a corporate dynamic .
we are one people together .
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and you know , it 's amazing .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kicked out pretty much every term .
i missed the cutoff by one point .
and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you , you know ?
and when i went online and looked at the infectious — read about the disease , i pretty much realized what was going on .
but the money ran out .
and finally , we figured , well , ok , we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital .
because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ?
but it 's damaging .
where are the rest of the swahili speakers ?
we 're now moving into east africa .
i 've also set up a project in kenya , and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps .
it costs us , like , 20 dollars a month just for hosting .
we have a comment function , where people can ask their mps questions .
you know , they 're not going to change just out of nowhere .
practically . i mean , when i was a first-year student in law school , my mom 's business had collapsed , so i was supporting her .
so , do n't underestimate that .
we just need a push .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they 're supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
it 's spreading virally .
it 's very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
so he 's getting citizens to check on them .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
it suggests how government could work better — not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
it 's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city 's call center , as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program — in fact , they all do that — you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
they 're not fighting that battle that we 're all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
it is about reasoning and proving our core activity .
it is about finding the truth .
the reward may be big .
and still , their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics .
and open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles .
`` it is the supreme law of unreason . '' '' and there 's no better way to materialize that supreme goddess than galton 's board . ''
all of science is like this .
it was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world .
from this observation alone , and clever mathematics , newton rightly deduced that the earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles , like 0.3 percent — so tiny that you would n't even notice it on the real view of the earth .
let 's work out a baby problem .
which ones are the most authoritative ?
and here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try .
it is filled with perplexity , frustration , a desperate fight for understanding .
it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas , which are a crowd of electrons .
but still , a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing .
but the truth is , the proof was just not working .
there was this voice in my head , i swear .
that being said , it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work .
and i 've been working with my staff at institut henri poincaré , together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide , so that we can found our own , very special museum of mathematics there .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
so , we can see the stars and the planets , but we ca n't see what holds them apart or what draws them together .
we ca n't see what makes people tick , at least not without difficulty .
and the closer we look at anything , the more it disappears .
`` and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , `` to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p . '' ''
gravity is one thing that we ca n't see and which we do n't understand .
it 's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces , and the weakest .
but we can touch each other , taste each other perhaps , if we get close enough .
this is extraordinary . because rice — get this — rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
the stars by day . i always think that 's fascinating .
livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer . a spine takes several years .
what are we ? what is this thing that we hang on , that is actually us ?
nobody ever will . they 're smaller than the wavelength of light .
it 's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual .
`` quite good . he also invented a word called `` '' blas , '' '' meaning astral radiation . ''
`` and somebody said to him , `` '' well what 's the point of these , heinrich ? ''
anyway , so the biggest thing that 's invisible to us is what we do n't know .
it is incredible how little we know .
and we can do that .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
now that 's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
we had to take them out , which we did .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refute .
( applause )
gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .
we can all picture astronauts in space .
they float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them .
and they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide , programmed cell death , or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided .
and then this bubbling , this membrane bubbling , is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell .
in that time , novocure 's developed two systems — one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body .
the patients learn to do this themselves and then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life .
there 's none of the tiredness .
`` there 's none of what is called the `` '' chemo head . '' '' there 's no sensation . ''
by month 12 , we could argue whether there 's a little bit of material around the edges , but it 's essentially completely gone .
it 's now five years since robert 's diagnosis , and he 's alive , but importantly , he 's healthy and he 's at work .
lydia 's a 66 year-old farmer in switzerland .
she underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years , none of which had an effect .
there 's now a new research project underway at the karolinska in sweden to prove that hypothesis .
we have more trials planned for lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , ovarian cancer and breast cancer .
i 'm also very hopeful that in the next decades , we will make big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease .
( applause )
some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother , mamar , in our four-family home in brooklyn , new york .
and by the time a diagnosis was made , she was in a deep spiral .
now many of you will recognize her symptoms .
and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression .
so , we have to ask ourselves the question : why leave women 's health to chance ?
it showed no blockages .
linda 's symptoms continued .
and what we found was that linda 's disease did n't look like the typical male disease .
there 's a discrete blockage or stenosis .
linda 's disease , like the disease of so many women , looks like this .
now , linda received the right treatment .
but linda was lucky .
the authors looked at papers written over a 10-year period , and hundreds had to be thrown out .
now let 's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer — these are the dollars invested per death — and the dollars invested in lung cancer .
and when you put men and women in a functional mri scanner — that 's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it 's activated — so you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress .
and it 's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression .
but even though we know that these differences occur , 66 percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified .
so , i think we have to ask again the question : why leave women 's health to chance ?
we know that these differences are often overlooked .
women 's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay .
now , this is a profound question because the answer is likely yes , but your doctor may not know the answer , at least not yet .
i 'll leave that to others .
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
in the space that used to house one transistor , we can now fit one billion .
that made it so that a computer the size of an entire room now fits in your pocket .
let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there .
this is a microscope in a typical lab that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen , like a biopsy or a pap smear .
and this is the kind of observation that we 're going to use to make a better cancer detector .
now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky , and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor .
we designed it to listen for tumor invasion : the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread .
for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in , it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues .
one enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour .
thank you .
( applause )
you 've all seen lots of articles on climate change , and here 's yet another new york times article , just like every other darn one you 've seen .
what 's unusual about this one , maybe , is that it 's from 1953 .
this is the growth rate of co2 in the atmosphere .
so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible , that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line .
here 's some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year 's minimum of the arctic sea ice , and it 's the lowest by far .
and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models .
cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
but nevertheless , that 's not what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight .
what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing .
but one of the reasons it 's politically hard is there are winners and losers — not all losers .
and the reason is , it 's been done .
there 's lots of mystery in the details , and there 's some bad side effects , like it partially destroys the ozone layer — and i 'll get to that in a minute .
so here are the graphs you 've seen lots of times before .
the lower graph is with twice the amount of co2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight , and you 're back to the original climate .
so , in a sense , there 's not much new .
the one new thing is this essay .
but in the last year , paul crutzen published this essay saying roughly what 's all been said before : that maybe , given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts , we should think about things like this .
and in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away .
and it turns out , i woke up the next morning , and i started to calculate this .
so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere , about 100 kilometers up , that already have this effect .
but let 's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it 's unevenly heated .
there are a bunch of other versions of it that i and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit .
i 'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it .
and that calculation is n't much in dispute .
but we do n't really know how quickly we have to cut them .
but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast , fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years , and remove some of the biggest cities from the map .
but i have a lot of reservations .
so here 's one last thought , which was said much , much better 25 years ago in the u.s. national academy report than i can say today .
there was no responsibility .
what is the underpinning , scientifically , of this financial observatory ?
`` we developed a theory called `` '' dragon-kings . '' '' dragon-kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own . ''
so the cause of the crash , the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system , and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur .
what does it mean ?
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , parturition , the act of giving birth , epileptic seizures .
now , these are big claims .
why would you believe me ?
you know , they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now .
`` our critics , reading the prediction , said , `` '' no , it 's not possible . ''
you influenced the market .
it shows that it 's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies .
let me tease you with a very recent analysis .
17th of may , 2013 , just two weeks ago , we identified that the u.s. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the 21st of may that there will be a change of regime .
this is not a crash .
but the dragon-king theory gives hope .
we learn that most systems have pockets of predictability .
they were responding to immediate concerns .
we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what 's going on .
and this was an important thing about 19th century technology , that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart , even when judged by the most expert people .
and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger .
the lesson of the titanic , for a lot of the contemporaries , was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship .
the reason for it , in part , was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable .
well , technology to the rescue .
so this was the best job he could get .
he had to have some errors . he had to have some mistakes .
they might have been able to do it earlier .
thank you very much .
( applause )
are you ready to go ? ok .
just to make it a little bit more exciting .
one in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness , so if it was one , two , three , four , it 's you , sir .
you . yeah . ( laughter ) with the weird teeth . and you next to him . ( laughter ) you know who you are .
i always dreamt that , when i had my final breakdown , it would be because i had a deep kafkaesque existentialist revelation , or that maybe cate blanchett would play me and she would win an oscar for it . ( laughter ) but that 's not what happened . i had my breakdown during my daughter 's sports day .
we 've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world .
i do n't know if you can get that here . ( laughter ) so , zizzing away , and so — ( laughter ) — and for every one — i know , i drew this myself . thank you .
your pets are happier than you are . ( laughter ) ( applause ) so kitty cat , meow , happy happy happy , human beings , screwed . ( laughter ) completely and utterly — so , screwed .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you .
( laughter ) it 's a curious shape for a normal condition .
but i like to think back further to the ultimate cause .
now of course , a.i . is still nowhere near having the same powerful , cross-domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has .
in this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence .
but i think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence , the true picture is actually probably more like this : ai starts out at this point here , at zero intelligence , and then , after many , many years of really hard work , maybe eventually we get to mouse-level artificial intelligence , something that can navigate cluttered environments as well as a mouse can .
here it gets trickier .
when the a.i . is weak , it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile .
another example , suppose we give a.i . the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem .
and notice that this gives the a.i.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of .
human beings in this model are threats , we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved .
of course , perceivably things wo n't go wrong in these particular ways ; these are cartoon examples .
a , this is not necessarily so easy to do if we 've grown dependent on the system — like , where is the off switch to the internet ?
and we could try to make our job a little bit easier by , say , putting the a.i . in a box , like a secure software environment , a virtual reality simulation from which it can not escape .
now , i 'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved .
that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
a break of light and air , an architectural biding of time .
the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive , dark green-gray , striated aluminum siding .
take-out sandwich shops , film processing drop-offs , peep-shows and necktie stores .
that 's the end .
the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry .
apricot halves like the ears of cherubim .
upon his death in 1967 , a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant .
( laughter ) unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century turkish figs for breakfast . ( laughter )
a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar .
and then i waited .
on long commutes to work , in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to , on our lunch breaks , we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and african .
and my whole world did open up .
for example , in apartheid south africa , black south africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure .
africa has six of the world 's largest refugee centers .
and who does that benefit ?
and i think that thing is social pan-africanism .
my dream is that young africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas , is our home .
before now , if you wanted to hear from the youth in africa , you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth — ( laughter ) to wake up in the morning , take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time .
before now , if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government , you were pushed to protest , suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some western paper somewhere might make someone care .
we support south african students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees .
but finally , i got myself involved .
`` i say , `` '' oh , no , i continue . '' '' so , i did tropical ecology and plant botany . ''
that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants .
here we have savanna giraffes , but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo .
thirteen species — highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
torture , wars — oh , my god , you ca n't believe .
every person was looking his way — where to go , we do n't know .
all my friends said , we are leaving because we are a target .
and this is a bright guy , hard-working person , and pygmy .
i 've been working with him about 10 years .
what 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
we do n't think so .
sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , lingala .
and every time , daily , after we have meeting , what compromise we have , whatever , i go , i write a short email , send it .
one day , we went to meet the chief commander .
and i was sending news , doing whatever , reporting daily to the u.n. , to unesco , to our institution in new york , what have been going .
they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war , because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere .
see what the wars in rwanda .
and i think , helping us , people are acting sometimes by ignorance .
i did it myself .
if i know when i was young , that [ by ] killing an elephant , i 'm destroying biodiversity , i would not have done it .
how many have got opportunity like me to go to u.s. , do a master 's ?
`` the second set of ideas i call `` '' ideas in progress . '' '' those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet . ''
india is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years .
then there is the whole northern india , which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend .
but a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
in other words , if you do n't really invest in the human capital , the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster .
forty years back , computers were seen as something which was forbidding , something which was intimidating , something that reduced jobs .
increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that , are moving towards creating india as a single market .
this is one of the factors which needs to be resolved .
this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce , you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised .
therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws , which are not as onerous as they are today .
indian higher education is completely regulated .
it 's very difficult for a foreign university to come to india .
therefore we 're to rethink the whole way we look at health .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission , we want to really lower the use of energy — it has to be solved in countries like india .
we all , i think , believe in compassion .
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
and , of course , you ca n't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what 's right about life , what 's right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
and that unity is something that connects all of creation .
`` this `` '' 18 minutes '' '' business , i find quite fascinating . ''
`` and they say `` '' it 's 18 minutes . '' '' because that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven . ''
and , as many people do , he was dozing off during the sermon .
`` he said , `` '' god wants bread . that 's it . god wants bread . i know what god wants . '' '' and he rushed home . and after the sabbath , he made 12 loaves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , `` '' god , i do n't know why you want this bread , but here you are . '' '' and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah . ''
`` `` there 's bread ! god , you 've answered my plea . you 've answered my question . '' ''
and he called the two of them to his office .
`` `` you mean god did n't want my bread ? '' ''
and then i have to try to see in what ways i can make these the hands of god .
( laughter ) the tapeworm drains nutrients from artemia 's body , but it also does other things .
and here is another example of a parasitic manipulation .
this is a suicidal cricket .
crickets are really roomy . who knew ?
this caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it .
now , the caterpillar did n't die .
( applause ) we have a lot to get through . i only have 13 minutes . ( laughter ) now , some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world , that they are outliers , and that point of view is understandable , because by their nature , parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things .
especially common were trematodes , tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail .
they have as much control over their own fates as my car .
we take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods , and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else 's mind ?
if there are any , this is a good candidate for them .
toxo infects mammals , a wide variety of mammals , but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat .
( laughter ) ( applause ) you 're very charitable , generous people .
we are more intelligent than a mere rat , to be sure , but our brains have the same basic structure , the same types of cells , the same chemicals running through them , and the same parasites .
estimates vary a lot , but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have toxo in their brains .
now typically , this does n't lead to any overt illness .
and while that idea may be disquieting , and while parasites ' habits may be very grisly , i think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin .
but what makes a public space work ?
well , i would sit in the park and watch very carefully , and first among other things were the comfortable , movable chairs .
the first opportunity i had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s , when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river .
`` and he asked me , `` '' so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers ? '' '' well , i did n't have any idea . ''
now , you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants , so we were excited about the prospect of growth , but honestly , where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water ?
and if we could n't spread out , which was probably a good thing , where could new housing go ?
honestly , i had no idea how it would turn out .
and here is a new park in lower manhattan .
and after 9/11 , the city had very little control .
are there other people there ?
where there used to be parking spaces , there are now pop-up cafes .
and when i saw it the first time , honestly , when i went up on that old viaduct , i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person , honestly .
hey , why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the high line ?
perhaps the high line did n't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill .
public space can change how you live in a city , how you feel about a city , whether you choose one city over another , and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city .
you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
soon , you 'll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place .
what 's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
but if you 're still in pain in six months ' or six years ' time , it 's because these circuits are producing pain that 's no longer helping you .
and so cars , as art , brings it into an emotional plane — if you accept that — that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a .
and they 're not very emotional ; they solve a purpose ; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways ; they 've also been a real pain in the ass , because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve .
cars are a sculpture — did you know this ?
`` many people think , `` '' well , it 's computers , and it 's done by machines and stuff like that . '' '' well , they reproduce it , but the originals are all done by hand . ''
i want to talk about this .
and it 's done by men and women working just like this , making cars .
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it 's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars .
and we 're kind of the female side to that . that 's ok , that 's cool . you go off and be manly . we 're going to be a little bit more female .
`` `` all is fair in design and war . '' ''
certainly we live in a competitive society .
and one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like pygmalion , we are completely in love with our own creations .
we have a shared center ; we have a shared focus — that car stays at the middle of all our relationships .
like i said , i just had a phone number that connected me to them .
now , i got some postcards of these guys in las vegas , and i got some postcards of these guys in the grand canyon , and i got these postcards of niagara falls , and pretty soon they 're in new york , and i do n't know where else .
on the other hand , i did n't know anything about this . ok ?
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
this can not be . this can not be that i 'm expecting a certain number of sketches , and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team .
it 's analyzing trends . it 's predicting the future .
look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
( applause )
this is our motivation .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
there are two general types .
they 're called body-powered prostheses , which were invented just after the civil war , refined in world war i and world war ii .
you open it , these muscles contract .
we built our own arm at the rehab institute of chicago where we 've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it 's really , really hard .
so my colleague , dr. greg dumanian , did the surgery .
and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
so you touch jesse here , he feels his thumb ; you touch it here , he feels his pinky .
so this is really exciting for us , because now we have a portal , a portal , or a way to potentially give back sensation , so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
( applause ) so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
then we fit her with a prosthesis .
so i did n't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
tk : okay , this was my goal .
so we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks — from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something — and recorded this data .
i have the wrist rotation that goes — and it can go all the way around .
and i have the wrist flexion and extension .
she 's carrying all the weight through harnesses .
takes about a minute .
`` what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , `` '' what hand grasp pattern do i want ? '' '' it goes into that mode , and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand . ''
i had the key grip , i had a chuck grip , i had a power grasp and i had a fine pinch .
tk : all right . so that 's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
once we can do it that small , it 's a lot easier making them bigger .
so amanda came jet-lagged , she 's using the arm , and everything goes wrong .
and thankfully dr. annie simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it .
who cleans up after us ?
i wanted to get to know them as individuals .
what 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
it 's there , but it 's not as prevalent as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly .
according to the bureau of labor statistics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country , and i learned why .
when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck , you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself .
diseases we 've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us .
so in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you , take a moment to acknowledge them .
and if there 's a new opportunity or a new danger , the bees can not reinvent the social system overnight .
other animals , like the social mammals — the wolves , the elephants , the dolphins , the chimpanzees — they can cooperate much more flexibly , but they do so only in small numbers , because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge , one of the other .
think even about this very talk that i 'm giving now : i 'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people , most of you are complete strangers to me .
i do n't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here , yesterday , to london .
nevertheless , even though we do n't know each other , we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas .
this is something chimpanzees can not do .
we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers , because we alone , of all the animals on the planet , can create and believe fictions , fictional stories .
but what i want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation , not only in the religious field .
many of you today , perhaps , work for a corporation , like google or toyota or mcdonald 's .
what exactly are these things ?
`` bg : in the book , if i understand it correctly , you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better , but they will create — and i quote you — `` ... new classes and new class struggles , just as the industrial revolution did . '' ''
( laughter ) as computers become better and better in more and more fields , there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant .
what happened ? the industrial revolution , which meant that all of a sudden , europe and america became the dominant center of the world .
the state 's not alone . there are many , many actors .
it 's worth noticing that a non-state actor attacking the united states in 2001 killed more americans than the government of japan did in 1941 .
and that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood , and yet it 's tremendously important .
indeed , people were over-enthusiastic in the early 2000s , thinking america could do anything , which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures , and now we 're back to decline again .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
you know , everything says , here 's the growth rate of china , here 's the growth rate of the u.s. , here it goes — straight line .
history is not linear .
if you 're sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in hanoi , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you 're sitting in beijing .
because , if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this , the facts , not the myths , you may have policies which are very dangerous .
notice both halves of that explanation .
power is multi-polar .
it 's one in which we can all gain .
how do we produce global public goods , which are good for us , but good for everyone at the same time ?
in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
thank you very much .
i recruited my co-admin , abdelrahman mansour .
i saw a spark of hope .
and it made it impossible for the regime to stop it .
a few hours before the regime cut off the internet and telecommunications , i was walking in a dark street in cairo , around midnight .
one covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me .
after 11 days of complete darkness , i was set free .
the euphoria faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
my online world became a battleground filled with trolls , lies , hate speech .
and on the 3rd of july 2013 , the army ousted egypt 's first democratically elected president , after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation .
we tend to only communicate with people that we agree with , and thanks to social media , we can mute , un-follow and block everybody else .
this is so important .
i will get more attention .
what is more important : the total number of readers of a post you write , or who are the people who have impact that read what you write ?
in essence , we need to rethink today 's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness , civility and mutual understanding .
we 're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds .
but part of this internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior .
jung in afghanistan — you get the picture .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
`` and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children , and i will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter , '' '' — what happens too often in afghanistan . ''
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces , and you are the first to see the results .
i thank you for your attention .
so i learned to follow hunches even though you ca n't necessarily justify them or know where they 're going to go .
this is the primary use we saw of twitter from the beginning , and what got us excited .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
but it was n't just individuals .
and they 're tweeting , in some cases , from behind closed-door sessions with the president .
`` worst talk ever ! '' '' ( laughter ) evan williams : nice . thanks . ''
ca : that was very interesting .
that is , you know what simplicity is , you know what complexity is .
a coffee cup — we do n't think about coffee cups , but it 's much more interesting than one might think — a coffee cup is a device , which has a container and a handle .
why is that important ?
so the coffee cup , or the cup with a handle , is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health .
and the other , of course , is a birth control pill , which , in a very simple way , fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .
a second argument would be : because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on — that 's an historical argument .
all of these are possibilities .
one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task — which you may not know that you have very often — which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation . ( laughter ) and the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence , because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things . ( laughter )
and if you look at the list of things on the bottom , we are familiar with the arabic numbers one to 10 and so on .
and think of things in your life that are binary , one of them is light switches .
what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost .
now , the example is something that i want to give you from the work that we ourselves do .
and , since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an 18 year-old with an ak-47 , who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing , he can take a picture of it with his cellphone , send the picture back to where there is a doctor , and the doctor can look at it .
so , let me close — ( applause ) let me close with my two aphorisms .
( applause ) chris anderson : quick question .
ca : that was a simple , powerful answer . gw : yes .
now , many of the problems that children with autism face , they have a common source , and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction , symbolism .
let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
what it does n't help them do is to learn word patterns .
it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to .
you want to eat ? somebody else wants to eat ?
so i was very excited by this , you know , hopping around all over the place , trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear into this .
`` this is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation , you want to say , `` '' i do n't want soup , '' '' then you ca n't do that by asking a question . ''
let me show you this with a different example .
`` i 'm going to start with the word `` '' tell . '' '' so this is the word `` '' tell . '' '' now this happened in the past , so i 'm going to make that `` '' told . '' '' now , what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to ask questions . ''
so i call this freespeech , and i was playing with this for many , many months .
so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english .
the first thing i did was i built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes , in the form of colors , and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works .
let 's talk about speech .
it 's also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
now , it seems to me that language is really the brain 's invention to convert this rich , multi-dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand .
take google , for example .
it does n't have any specific information in it which is about english .
but if you look at what 's inside the engine , it 's actually not very complicated .
we have so many different languages .
there 's a song about india , and there 's a description of the country as , it says , ( in sanskrit ) .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you . ( applause )
but if you can do it , it works really well .
they were combined in the media .
i would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these , so there 's always a client attached to them .
so this is the big pedestrian zone in linz .
as you all know , newsprint yellows significantly in the sun .
and it sounds quite simple , but actually it 's quite a big , big job .
because you know , when you look at a piece of music — for example , if i just open my little motorbike bag — we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
so technically , i can actually read this .
and so therefore , because time is short , if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . it 's very straightforward .
but here i 'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .
i 'm being told which part of the stick to use .
and i 'm also being told that the drum is without snares .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc. , etc .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
not just translate them , but interpret them .
`` and i remember when i was 12 years old , and i started playing tympani and percussion , and my teacher said , `` well , how are we going to do this ? you know , music is about listening . '' ''
and that 's basically what we are . we 're just human beings , but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were , that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things .
so therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
but yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
and so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participators of sound .
`` for me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music , it 's very easy for me to say , `` '' oh yes , i like that piece . ''
it may be that the chemistry is n't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music , but that does n't mean i have the right to say it 's a bad piece of music .
and you know , it 's just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
if i asked you to clap — maybe i can do this .
`` and instead of him saying , `` '' ok , evelyn , please , feet slightly apart , arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more-or-less v shape , keep this amount of space here , etc . ''
`` and constantly , the question , `` '' well , why ? why ? what is this relating to ? ''
and we should save trees in the end .
so what can we do ?
they were run by an inexperienced staff , with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals — in many places there were not even art directors .
i decided to be — to work for them as an art director .
i came to london , and i 've seen performance by cirque du soleil .
the front page became our signature .
not even magazines : posters .
but it 's not only about the front page .
and the process we made was not about changing the look , it was about improving the product completely .
i took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design .
then we adjust the content accordingly .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
the first lesson is about that design can change not just your product .
you can live in a small poor country , like me .
thank you .
there are many biological systems like that — brains , cells , developing embryos .
and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds .
and they forage maybe for about 20 meters away , gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest , and store them .
and because of that , i 've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger .
and she 's in the process of mating with this male , and there 's another male on top waiting his turn .
so this is a one-year-old colony — this happens to be 536 .
this is a three-year-old colony .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
there 's a lot of damage to the nest , and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess .
and curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
`` so when i first set out to work on task allocation , my first question was , `` '' what 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks ? ''
`` and instead i wanted to ask , `` '' how are the different task groups interdependent ? '' '' so i did experiments where i changed one thing . ''
and so just to summarize the result , well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are interdependent .
if there 's more patrolling to do — so i created a disturbance , so extra patrollers were needed — the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol .
but the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
and what i 've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact .
so it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker .
and we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside , the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
and it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it , as they would to contact with real ants .
and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out .
each ant , then , as it comes back in , is contacting other ants .
so one of the things i look at is , how did the universe begin and shape ?
this is a star , this is a star , everything else is a galaxy , ok ?
so the question should come to your mind is , what kind of design , you know , what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that ?
but you get out to jupiter and it 's 40 minutes away . it 's a problem .
but you go and look to the center of the galaxy , it 's thousands of years ago .
but you can see the edge of the sun , and the universe gets that way , and you can see that .
and what we saw was , we saw these variations , and then they told us the secrets , both about the structure of space-time , and about the contents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original motions .
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion , and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent , then to the dark ages , and then the first stars turn on , and they evolve into galaxies , and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .
and every time there 's a galaxy — at its location there 's a galaxy — and if we know anything about the galaxy , which we do , because there 's a redshift measurement and everything , you put in the type of galaxy and the color , so this is the real representation .
and that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated .
we 're going to zoom in , but this is a plot of what it is .
and you 'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids .
this is a region which probably has more than 100,000 , on the order of a million galaxies in that region .
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .
now we 're into a distance sort of between here and here .
so they 're simple building blocks .
it 's got dark matter , it 's got ordinary matter , it 's got photons and it 's got neutrinos , which do n't play much role in the later part of the universe .
and it 's grown up in some kind of way .
how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together , right ?
you see how the filament — you see how several filaments are coming together , therefore making this supercluster of galaxies .
and so the idea is , you know , how would you put together the universe in a very simple way ?
we 're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments , was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .
and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on .
there are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000 , and then over billions of years , gravity just pulls in .
we see the same large-scale structure , but we see additional small-scale structure .
and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the earth .
give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like .
experiments were all wrong .
they have seven tentacles , and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes , and a brain shaped like a pretzel .
there are lots of people who believe that , and i think it is utter baloney .
`` and someday , we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces , what i call the `` '' fundamental law . '' '' we may not even be terribly far from it . ''
newton certainly believed that .
now , what happens is that as we do that , as we peel these skins of the onion , and we get closer and closer to the underlying law , we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one , and with the next one . we write them out mathematically , and we see they use very similar mathematics .
and the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin .
and that 's why the equations look so simple .
they are symmetries of the sphere .
so we say , in general , that there 's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon , or its description , unchanged .
maxwell 's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space .
someday we may find some slight hole in that argument .
so the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one .
`` so he said that this principle of nature , consonance : `` '' this principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers , i forbore to describe it in that book , lest i should be accounted an extravagant freak ... `` '' that 's what we all have to watch out for , ( laughter ) especially at this meeting . ''
they are what we call emergent properties .
it does n't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
and it begins with my student nick .
let 's see if we can understand glucose response .
`` and i said , `` '' huh . there are millions of americans on those two drugs . '' '' in fact , we learned later , 15 million americans on paroxetine at the time , 15 million on pravastatin , and a million , we estimated , on both . ''
we have a copy of it that 's ok for research , we removed identifying information .
harvard found 100 patients , same trend .
and lo and behold , glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice .
`` but he said , `` '' no , russ — you might not understand . ''
`` if it 's `` '' pravastatin , '' '' the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline . ''
they increased glucose .
thank you very much .
we relinquish control of yaw , but roll , pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration .
fourth , we only execute 20 milliseconds ' worth of that strategy .
mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second .
take this quad , for example .
we can use mathematical models to estimate the force that i 'm applying to the quad .
once we know this force , we can also change the laws of physics , as far as the quad is concerned , of course .
i will use this new capability to position this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration .
like all our past creations and innovations , they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused .
and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions , and really to follow my journey .
it is the capital of the country , and it took 23 years to build , which is something they seem to be very proud of over there .
`` and that really struck me about my father , in the sense that he had such belief that somehow , doing these things giving in the way that he gave , that something good would come out of it , even in the middle of a war , there was a war with pakistan at one point , and the construction stopped totally and he kept working , because he felt , `` '' well when the war is done they 'll need this building . '' '' so , those are the two clips i 'm going to show . ''
nk : yeah . no not louis farrakhan , louis kahn .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only paddy fields , and since we invited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
he did n't care for how much money this country has , or whether he would be able to ever finish this building , but somehow he has been able to do it , build it , here .
( applause )
you know , i found that volcano on google images , not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of dianetics .
so you can pick up the phone , you hear a dial tone , but its just a fake-out . it 's a wav file of a dial tone , just to reassure you that the world has n't ended .
and as a result of voice over ip — i hate that term — voice over internet — land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years .
( laughter ) but it 's actually really , really cool . you have a choice of phones , and we 're not talking smartphones — ordinary phones , including a blackberry , that have wi-fi .
anyway , they have wi-fi phones in europe .
but the thing that t-mobile did that nobody 's done before is , when you 're on a call an you move from wi-fi into cellular range , the call is handed off in mid-syllable , seamlessly . i 'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the new york times to test this gear .
now you get it .
you can make free unlimited calls home to the us with these phones . so , very , very interesting .
you will pay .
google bought it , and they 've been working on it for a year .
i do n't know if you realize this . when you call 411 on your cell phone , they charge you two bucks .
i actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there .
you hit send , and in five seconds , they will send you back the two closest drugstores , complete with name address and phone number .
shortly i 'll tell you why i was in milan .
here we go . and those are just the beginning .
( laughter ) google : bagels , monterey , california .
top eight results : number one , bagel bakery on el dorado street .
`` i 'm like , `` '' what 's the word that means you know , like , when the sun , the moon and the earth are , like , all in a line ? '' '' just to see how the recognition was . ''
it is a life-changer .
`` the services are called things like spinvox , phonetag — this is the one i use — callwave . a lot of people say , `` '' how are they doing this ? ''
i think basically it 's like these guys in india with headsets , you know , listening in .
hope you 're doing well . i 'm fine here . everything 's good .
( laughter ) i love my job . ( laughter )
basically , you 're going to go on some iffy date , or a potentially bad meeting .
phone : well , that 's good .
phone : hey , this is mr. johnson calling from the office .
finally cingular said ok .
it 's got bad things and good things . lets all acknowledge that right now .
anyway — but this teaches people what it 's like .
this is the etch-a-sketch program — the theme of eg 2008 .
this is urbanspoon . you 're in a city . it knows from gps where you 're standing .
you want to find a place to eat . you shake it .
but now it 's everybody else . so google has done their own android operating system that will soon be on handsets — phones from 34 companies .
this is a song i did for the new york times website as a music video .
bad sound , the signal 's weak , the software stinks .
i 've heard there 's something new — a million times more rad than my phone .
i want an iphone .
concerns — i have a few . it 's got some flaws ; we may just face it .
i want to wipe the smudges clean .
`` i want to say , `` '' look — now i 'm cool '' '' i stood in line and i 'll get mine . ''
for what is a man ?
but derek , your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it , bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break .
you know , there 's this little child who ca n't see , ca n't really understand much about the world , has no one in the family who plays an instrument , and yet he taught himself to play that .
( laughter ) now then , by the age of 10 , derek really had taken the world by storm .
this is a photo of you , derek , playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops .
and in those days , derek , you did n't speak very much , and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you 'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you 'd play the right piece in the right key , and all that kind of thing .
it 's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique , and luckily , derek , you decided that , once we did start learning , you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings .
ao : you may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking , but derek does it effortlessly . now then .
`` ( laughter ) but in america , they 've coined this term , `` '' the human ipod '' '' for derek , which i think is just missing the point , really , because derek , you 're so much more than an ipod . ''
`` dp : he played `` '' chopsticks . '' '' ao : and played `` '' chopsticks . '' '' dp : `` '' chopsticks . '' '' ao : a bit like this . dp : like this . yes . ''
( piano notes ) ao : i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it .
the ted people will kill me , but perhaps there 's time for one encore .
and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom .
but that does n't really make you fluent .
but coding does n't have to be like this .
so , of course , making a fish game is n't the only thing you can do with scratch .
of the millions of projects on the scratch website , there 's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork , and , yes , interactive mother 's day cards .
the same way that this uses the camera to get information into scratch , you can also use the microphone .
you learn more about how computers work .
it 's nothing that , really , they can make use of .
as victor worked on this project and created the scripts , he was also learning about the process of design , how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged , functioning project like you see here .
again , it 's useful to think about this analogy with language .
if you 're interested in giving it a try , i 'd encourage you to go to the scratch website .
it 's scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
well , in this technique , what i 've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world , the artisan bread-baking community , has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so — since we 've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america — and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads .
and let 's face it , everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains .
we 're going to try this at lunch , and i 'll explain a bit more about it , but it 's made not only with two types of pre-doughs — this attempt , again , at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened .
`` it 's hydrated dough we call `` '' the soaker '' '' — that helps to start enzyme activity . ''
that 's the challenge . okay , so , now , what we — in the journey of wheat , let 's go back and look at these 12 stages .
okay , we 're going to start with the first stage .
`` everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is `` '' mise en place , '' '' which is just a french way of saying , `` '' get organized . '' '' everything in its place . first stage . ''
there 's no gluten in flour . there 's only the potential for gluten .
then we get into fermentation , the third stage , which is really where the flavor develops .
we , after it 's fermented and it 's developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats — sweat , burps and starch guts .
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
in other words , personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker .
and then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
and at stage 10 , we take it to the oven .
so you see the symbolism at work ? it 's starting to come forth a little bit , you know .
third transformation , alive to dead — but dough to bread .
or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
this is the product that everyone in the world eats , that is so difficult to give up .
it 's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
beer is basically liquid bread , or bread is solid beer .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
i 'll leave you with what i call the baker 's blessing .
there 's not a lot of science behind that one either .
now there 's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350 .
we 're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450 , so we 've got to accept we 're going to do an overshoot , and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what 's the pathway back to 350 .
but to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change .
but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic .
one day where we had calm seas and sun , which was the reason i could get off the ship .
so that trip just ended , and i ca n't show you too many results from that right now , but we 'll go back one more year , to another drilling expedition i 've been involved in .
it 's the andrill project .
so we drill back in time to see how often that 's happened , and exactly how fast that ice can melt .
we drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor .
and this is in the past four million years .
this was completely unexpected .
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
and it could be larger than that .
and so , when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event , it leaves this indelible record .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
so we have a diamond drill .
each one of those is a year .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
in this case , at these islands , you know , corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water .
there 's a whole family of curves here .
some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
and there is natural variability caused by the sun , caused by el ninos .
i like it as a component of global change to talk about , because , even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic , and i talk to that community fairly often , you can not deny the simple physics of co2 dissolving in the ocean .
and as it does so , it makes the ocean more acidic .
there 's consequences for carbonate organisms .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere , going back millions of years .
that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that 's going on right now .
adam and eve one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked .
and the rest is history .
[ @ adam last nite was a blast ! loved dat apple lol ] [ @ eve yep.. babe , know what happened to my pants tho ? ] we do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before , and so much information about us is being collected by organizations .
well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
in fact , we did n't develop the app to make it available , just as a proof of concept .
now interestingly , among our subjects , some had posted comparable information , and some had not .
if you think so , then you are not like the u.s. employers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that .
we created facebook profiles , manipulating traits , then we started sending out résumés to companies in the u.s. , and we detected , we monitored , whether they were searching for our candidates , and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media . and they were .
now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight .
`` [ have you ever cheated in an exam ? ] now to one group of subjects , we told them , `` only other students will see your answers . '' ''
`` to another group of subjects , we told them , `` students and faculty will see your answers . '' ''
but then we added the misdirection .
of course , these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you do n't hear more about them .
`` in `` '' brave new world , '' '' he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us . ''
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
and at the risk of playing the serpent , i will tell you that the tools for the fight are here , the awareness of what is going on , and in your hands , just a few clicks away .
( applause )
and that 's what i look at with my photographic work .
that 's 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
and that 's gone up since then , but we do n't have the numbers yet .
more than 700,000 children in the united states aged 18 and under begin smoking every year .
a strange phenomenon .
because my belief is , if we can feel these issues , if we can feel these things more deeply , then they 'll matter to us more than they do now .
my mother escaped north korea when she was 10 years old .
now , i know some of you are thinking , global capital markets , positive social change , not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph .
but if you got the words wrong , it would n't listen , and things could go terribly awry .
71 percent of people said yes , they were interested in sustainable investing , which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance .
oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results , and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency , lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price .
first , the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right , preserving all the same good principles of investing , the traditional sphere , can pay .
secondly , the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads .
she was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army , no obstacle , no big institution stand in her way .
passionate clarity : that 's what i think we need to drive change .
passion about the change we want to see in the world , and clarity that we are able to help chart the course .
change the fables and change the markets .
now , according to proponents of the clash of civilizations , barbie and fulla occupy these completely separate spheres .
( music ) ♫ she was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ she was adorned by the light of the quran ♫ shereen el feki : 4shbab has been dubbed islamic mtv .
its creator , who is an egyptian tv producer called ahmed abu haïba , wants young people to be inspired by islam to lead better lives .
my journey to become a polar specialist , photographing , specializing in the polar regions , began when i was four years old , when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island , up by greenland .
it 's a spirit bear , or a kermode bear .
he went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep .
♫ ah , ah , oh , ah , ah , oh , oh ♫ ♫ if you 'd ever been out walking you would know ♫ ( applause ) paul nicklen : thank you very much . the show 's not over .
we 're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it 's at its lowest level .
and this bear swam out to that seal — 800 lb . bearded seal — grabbed it , swam back and ate it .
here 's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere , and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice , which is great for them ; they 're safe at this point .
these little , fat dumplings , 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear .
and here we are diving in the beaufort sea .
when i 'm on my deathbed , i 'm going to remember one story more than any other .
the boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked .
and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out , so it can eat the meat off the bones , and then it goes off and gets another one .
so she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened — she totally relaxed .
this did n't work .
`` and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like , `` '' are you for real ? '' '' because she ca n't believe i ca n't eat this penguin . ''
because in her world , you 're either breeding or you 're eating — and i 'm not breeding , so ...
and she would get frustrated ; she 'd blow bubbles in my face .
they are the most remarkable animals i 've ever worked with , and the same with polar bears .
i get emotional . sorry .
we 've got to get the story out now . thank you very much .
he drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
`` and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , `` '' the musician . '' '' before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them . ''
and if we now compare the face of the statue , with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again .
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
and she 'd squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she 'd let me go .
`` then finally she said , `` '' the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol . '' '' ( laughter ) well i was nine years old , so i said , `` '' yes , mama . i 'll do that . '' '' i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger . ''
but i 'm 52 years old , and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol .
we can get them to do things that they do n't think they can do .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
it 's interesting to me .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
the only country in the world .
for every nine people who have been executed , we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been exonerated and released from death row .
it 's not our problem .
we 're constantly running into each other .
it would be unconscionable .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people — where you 're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white — in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
`` and every now and then ms. carr would call me , and she 'd say , `` '' bryan , ms. parks is coming to town . we 're going to get together and talk . ''
`` tell me what you 're trying to do . '' '' and i began giving her my rap . ''
i think if somebody takes something that does n't belong to them , they 're not just a thief .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you 're not , the judge must have magic power .
and because i was up too late , was n't thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
i had written these crazy things .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
that we can not be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
tm : thank you very much .
i 'm here for two reasons . these two guys are my two sons ford and wren .
in the popular culture , superman had the fortress of solitude , and there was , of course , the batcave .
and this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard , out of landscaping timbers , astroturf .
and he found the scoreboard in the trash .
this a 1923 wooden tugboat , made completely out of douglas fir .
so , pretty early on in my investigations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find , which was , quite frankly , a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen tvs .
this song kind of came out of all of that .
it 's the same pattern at many different scales .
this made no sense at all , so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books .
they were breathing those words with fractal lungs .
nature uses self-organizing systems .
`` ( laughter ) and so i finally got to this city , and i 'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold — but when i got there , i got to the palace of the chief , and my french is not very good ; i said something like , `` i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof . '' ''
this is a village in southern zambia .
`` when i first saw those african fractals , i thought , `` '' wow , so any indigenous group that does n't have a state society , that sort of hierarchy , must have a kind of bottom-up architecture . '' '' but that turns out not to be true . ''
i started collecting aerial photographs of native american and south pacific architecture ; only the african ones were fractal .
`` second , you might ask , `` well , dr. eglash , are n't you ignoring the diversity of african cultures ? '' ''
so in manghetu sculpture , you 'd see this recursive geometry .
you learn the next level of knowledge .
but i had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed , buried in sand , and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on .
and finally , he revealed the truth of the matter .
and it turns out it 's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos .
and the most interesting thing i found out about it was historical .
in the 12th century , hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain .
and there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy : divination through the earth .
`` leibniz , the german mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called `` '' de combinatoria . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let 's use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . '' '' right ? ones and zeros , the binary code . ''
george boole took leibniz 's binary code and created boolean algebra , and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer .
and i know brian eno says there 's not enough africa in computers , but you know , i do n't think there 's enough african history in brian eno .
actually , the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .
it 's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
these are robust algorithms .
now , how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people ?
so i became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap .
i started experimenting , making models , talking to experts in the field , taking their feedback , and refining , and i kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years .
in fact , 15 exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself .
`` so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , `` here , take it , for free . '' ''
so , in closing , on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we do n't really have anything to sell or give you yet .
but today i worry about , what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks ?
so my parents would go to dinner .
and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car — and almost ended up in the front hall .
but cars are really more than a passion of mine ; they 're quite literally in my blood .
and that was true until i got to college .
and as i look back over 30 years ago , it was a little naive to think at that age that i could . but i wanted to .
`` there were some within ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that i needed to stop hanging out with `` '' environmental wackos . '' '' i was considered a radical . ''
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it .
but with more people and greater prosperity around the world , that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century .
but that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest .
so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing .
frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
the city of masdar in abu dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another , and they go underneath the city streets .
now shared car services are also springing up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great .
but what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
and these systems are being tested right now , and frankly they 're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon .
but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
and we need people from all walks of life ; not just inventors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge .
and since then , the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live , where we work , where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around .
we do n't want to regress and lose that freedom .
and she said they had n't .
i 'm sorry to hear that , so you might know that it 's a very toxic substance , but you might not know that it 's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name : it 's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile .
one , it can really burn your eyes , and two , it can also help you to open them .
tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that i want to share with you this afternoon : that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game-changer in journalism , in activism , and as i see it , in the political discourse as well .
that idea started to dawn on me in early 2011 when i was covering a protest in são paulo .
it was the marijuana march , a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis .
when that group started to move , the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets , bombs , and then the gas .
this is a bus .
so the police violence against them started to grow as well .
there was this mainstream media version of the facts that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there .
we are using smartphones .
we are not competing for news .
we were covering more than 50 cities at the same time .
our posts and our videos were being seen by more than 11 million timelines a week .
nowhere on earth offers us such a perfect record .
in blizzard winds , the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse .
indeed , the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in antarctica .
every year , it begins with a snowflake , and by digging into fresh snow , we can see how this process is ongoing today .
do n't we already know how they affect temperatures ?
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
so , in the coldest place on earth , they work inside a refrigerator .
as they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven , so that , when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen , they can don a fresh pair .
the 109th air national guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to california , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the national ice core laboratory in denver , colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in europe .
but in fact i had 10 percent of that budget .
`` i did `` '' mars et avril '' '' for only 2.3 million . ''
and that brings me to the point of my talk , actually , how constraints , big creative constraints , can boost creativity .
but let me go back in time a bit .
he was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film , and to write , direct , and produce the film myself .
each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head , so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed , and we shot only his head .
it still sounds too low . ] jacques languirand : [ that 's normal .
the instrument always ends up resembling its model . ] ( music ) martin villeneuve : now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt , they 're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity , because i desperately needed these objects in my movie .
so that 's kind of a big problem too .
guy was interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money , but because i came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy .
it was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price , because they were n't even made .
well , i said , you know what , instead of mimicking his style , i might as well call the real guy and ask him , and i sent him my books , and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium .
why ? because i offered him a space to dream .
thank you .
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
i want to show you a couple of examples why .
so my collaborator erez and i were considering the following fact : that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language .
so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule , past-tense conjugation .
but some verbs are irregular .
now in some cases math can even help explain , or propose explanations for , historical forces .
so steve and i , through mathematical analysis , propose that there 's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this , which lies in our brains .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast , but because you 've hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle , on shelley , an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats , gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel .
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing .
not only that , they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap .
so as researchers , that 's what we decided to find out .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
in contrast , theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey .
look for the tree , and down .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
and their actions are fantastic .
i 'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .
now , i 'm a fairly slow learner , but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design was n't all that important — making things more attractive , making them a bit easier to use , making them more marketable .
so when we talk about design today , and particularly when we read about it in the popular press , we 're often talking about products like these .
but this was n't always the way .
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford .
`` you can see it represented here in j.m.w . turner 's painting , `` '' rain , steam and speed '' '' . ''
he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york .
with innovations like the great western , we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit .
i 'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses .
and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .
hilary cottam , charlie leadbeater , and hugo manassei of participle have taken this idea of participation , and in their manifesto entitled beveridge 4.0 , they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state .
in times of change we need new alternatives , new ideas .
because it gives us a new way of tackling problems .
so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate , we took a sort of more open , collaborative and participative approach .
to do that i think we have to take a more expansive view of design , more like brunel , less a domain of a professional priesthood .
i 'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma .
it is the process by which animals de-animate , appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed .
an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores .
to suggest that this all , sort of , about little , tiny creatures , i want to bring it close to home .
i was interested in what was going on in the bag , the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely .
occasionally , human beings are briefly de-animated , and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold .
seven hours later , still without a heartbeat , they brought her back to life , and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her .
and they found her hours later , frozen , lifeless , and they brought her back to life .
and , in fact , the animals we were working with in the lab — these little garden worms , nematodes — they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen .
and so i was wondering , when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier , that we noticed that , of course , she had no oxygen consumption , and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation .
i thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things .
we have , from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath — that 's when we 're newborn to when we 're dead — we can not reduce our metabolic rate below what 's called a standard , or basal metabolic rate .
ken robinson is here . he talked about the glories of failure .
well , we had a lot of them .
we tried many different chemicals and agents , and we failed over and over again .
so , one time , i was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed , and i was watching a television show .
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war i .
and because you ca n't bind the oxygen , maybe you would n't consume it , and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen .
i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us .
we have to get to phase 2 and phase 3. it 's going to take us a few years .
and i want to say that i think we 're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way , and that in the not too distant future , an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide , or some related compound , to a person suffering severe injuries , and that person might de-animate a bit , they might become a little more immortal .
and then , after they get that care — like the mouse , like the skier , like the 65-year-old woman — they 'll wake up .
like every other human being , i avoided trouble .
what followed that election was terrible violence , rape , and the killing of over 1,000 people .
my work was to document the violence .
i was scared , but i knew very well that that particular day , i had to make a decision .
most kenyans did not see the violence .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
i belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country , who want to bring about change , and they 're no longer afraid , and they 're no longer smart cowards .
that day in the stadium , i stood up as a smart coward .
do you know why you were born ?
thank you .
so from the music , the graffiti , the art , that 's what we do .
tr : yeah , of course . ( applause ) bm : in spite of being arrested , beaten up , threatened , the moment i discovered my voice , that i could actually stand up for what i really believed in , i 'm no longer afraid .
how do you feed a city ?
yet it 's one that 's rarely asked .
and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
and that 's going to pose an enormous problem .
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we do n't actually value it .
so how did we get here ?
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers .
and in fact , that 's true of every ancient city .
but of course not all of them were that small .
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .
everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .
this is another thing about food in cities : once its roots into the city are established , they very rarely move .
and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside , that 's where they were sold , which is why it 's called poultry .
and this changes everything .
we just read the back of a label on a packet .
500 years ago it 's what thomas more was asking himself .
because it 's an ideal . it 's an imaginary thing . we ca n't have it .
`` so i 've come up with an alternative , which is sitopia , from the ancient greek , `` '' sitos '' '' for food , and `` '' topos '' '' for place . ''
we live in a world shaped by food , and if we realize that , we can use food as a really powerful tool — a conceptual tool , design tool , to shape the world differently .
but you ca n't have scenes like this unless you have people like this .
it 's people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them .
here is a plant called kevin , or maybe it 's a plant belonging to a kid called kevin . i do n't know .
the best image i know of this is from 650 years ago .
it 's one we have to ask , and we have to start answering .
( applause )
they increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos , consuming different news , talking only to like-minded others and more and more choosing to live in different parts of the country .
you know , in my lab , the students that i work with , we 're talking about some sort of social pattern — i 'm a movie buff , and so i 'm often like , what kind of movie are we in here with this pattern ?
and who 's to say that they 're wrong ?
and conservatives tend to endorse values like loyalty , patriotism , respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals do .
so we conducted a study where we recruited liberals to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essay that would be compelling to a conservative in support of same-sex marriage .
why are they going to give that up just to agree with you on something that they do n't particularly want to agree with you on anyway ?
well , we believe it 's a technique that we call moral reframing , and we 've studied it in a series of experiments .
it was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline .
liberals are on board for environmental protection .
conservatives , however , were significantly more supportive of progressive environmental policies and environmental protection if they had read the moral purity essay than if they read one of the other two essays .
all these studies have the same clear message : if you want to persuade someone on some policy , it 's helpful to connect that policy to their underlying moral values .
let 's do it because it 's right .
we owe it to one another and our country to reach out and try to connect .
we ca n't afford to hate them any longer , and we ca n't afford to let them hate us either .
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .
and one of those competitions , i just won a small , little transistor philips radio .
so that 's what made me enter [ the ] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work , or art and finally i 'm here in front of you .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
`` so this is called `` '' self in progress . '' '' it 's just a trace of being in this body . ''
so what we conceive as a meaning is always not there ; it 's on the other side , even when we say dark , light , good , bad , tall , short — all meaning it does n't exist in reality .
when i was doing that , i always wondered since i 've worked with creators — and now you know , i 've moved to questioning the perception — whenever i see the bird flying in the sky , it just makes me feel like : is there anything behind , are there any traces up there , which as a human , we do n't see them ?
this is the work i made out of that material .
`` then i thought , `` '' i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help . '' '' so i told them , `` '' i 'd like to start an air freshener company . '' '' they said , `` '' of course . ''
so this is after a few weeks , this is after a few months .
and if they say they do n't get it , that 's also not true , because it 's in the air .
`` can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? '' '' i said , `` '' no , mom . it ca n't be . ''
so we do n't see dark , we do n't see light , we do n't see gravity , we do n't see electricity .
if we sculpt this , this has two reference points .
and skin at the other end also represents the floor .
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
that 's an in-joke , by the way .
( knocks ) and your next question is , can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery , a bulb and one piece of wire ?
would you be able to do that ?
ok. now , children get their ideas not from teachers , as teachers often think , but actually from common sense , from experience of the world around them , from all the things that go on between them and their peers , and their carers , and their parents , and all of that . experience .
was he beheaded in the end , or hung ?
( laughter ) now , those questions , which , of course , you 've got right , and you have n't been conferring , and so on .
now , if that was true , we 'd have trucks going round the country , filling people 's gardens in with soil , it 'd be a fantastic business .
and we asked them these questions , and we asked those questions of science graduates , and they could n't answer them .
and there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that 's happening in photosynthesis . for example , one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit , and the other half of the carbon equation , as i 'm very conscious as a trustee of kew , is how much things soak up , and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
it makes no odds . in fact , in the northern hemisphere , we 're further from the sun in summer , as it happens , but it makes no odds , the difference .
and this is nasa 's view . they 're stunningly similar .
that 's what you show people , right ? these are from textbooks , from websites , educational websites — and almost anything you pick up is like that .
and things that — where there is n't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium , and it all looks fantastic , ok ?
and it 's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works , it 's quite difficult to shift those .
so we 're not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood .
poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
ok ? we collude , and actually if you — if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams , to really understand , to see whether i 'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue , and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air , then i might have done better at science .
now — oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
if you are willing to do this , you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance , and you 'll see that face , the tongue stick out , the wrinkled nose , as if they 're trying to get rid of what 's in their mouth .
just like fear offers us protective benefits , disgust seems to do the same thing , except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us , or heights , but rather things that might poison us , or give us disease and make us sick .
so when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing , that clean thing becomes disgusting , not the other way around .
`` this comes from a nazi children 's book published in 1938 : `` '' just look at these guys ! the louse-infested beards , the filthy , protruding ears , those stained , fatty clothes ... ''
the first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs , we found a general pattern — this is with the psychologists yoel inbar and paul bloom — that in fact , across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative .
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . we asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
in particular , when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices , just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong .
so this past spring , as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad , i realized i needed to read the koran properly — as properly as i could , that is .
the presence of camels , mountains , desert wells and springs took me back to the year i spent wandering the sinai desert .
`` so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself , or as arthur arberry called his version , `` an interpretation . '' ''
or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .
`` because the koran is quite clear when it says that you 'll be `` a new creation in paradise '' and that you will be `` '' recreated in a form unknown to you , '' '' which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin . ''
there are no 72 virgins in the koran .
thank you .
( applause )
so i want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way .
i have a very difficult task .
and i thought , well maybe there is lithium-6 in this star , which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet .
`` and i was saying , `` '' no , excuse me . ''
the power of spectroscopy was actually realized by pink floyd already in 1973 .
a hot gas is producing emission lines only , no continuum .
it 's cool for me .
for instance , you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .
we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature , which belongs to osmium .
and we found that everything is normal .
it 's one of the mysteries we still have , super flares .
now to go ahead with this , we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe .
it is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars .
connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead , there can not be life .
it 's exactly the same game . a very tiny feature .
now imagine doing this test for other planets .
now very recently , very recently , i 'm talking about last six , seven , eight months , water , methane , carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .
if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star , you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere , because in a natural way it is impossible to do this .
and we have some interesting cases , candidates , so on , things which we ca n't really explain .
so let the story begin .
only then do i construct it .
i have been able , through careful invention , to transmit , with the mere flick of a switch , electricity across the ether .
we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation .
it lives off of rainwater , spring water , sunlight , and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world , we use just seven of them .
it 's one sustainable material that they will not run out of .
it is growing all around us .
`` ibu means `` '' mother , '' '' and ku means `` '' mine , '' '' so it represents my mother earth , and at ibuku , we are a team of artisans , architects and designers , and what we 're doing together is creating a new way of building . ''
over the past five years together , we have built over 50 unique structures , most of them in bali .
untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust .
( laughter ) and we bring it to site , and with tiny rulers , we measure each pole , and consider each curve , and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site .
why not round ?
slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread , hand-carve each to fit the other , leave the crusts on , and what we 're doing , it is almost entirely handmade .
how many of you have not been to oklahoma city and have no idea who i am ? ( laughter ) most of you . let me give you a little bit of background .
and then they shot him .
ron norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development was n't incentivizing companies up front , it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate , and so he pushed an initiative called maps that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff .
the media and the internet love to rank cities .
we were n't anywhere close to the top , but we were on the list , we were somebody .
and i had this huge closet full of clothes , and i could only wear a third of it at any one time , and only i knew which part of the closet i could wear .
( laughter ) but if you happen to be a person , you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn .
we had fixed that , but it had been relatively recently , and there were literally 100,000 or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability .
and as i tried to examine how we might deal with obesity , and was taking all of these elements into my mind , i decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation .
`` this is a city that 's wanting to do something about it . '' '' and so they started helping us drive traffic to the website . ''
people were signing up , and so the pounds started to add up , and the conversation that i thought was so important to have was starting to take place .
well , i knew i did , so i picked up the magazine and i began to look , and we were n't on it .
of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
and companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth g .
but the question is easier said than done .
and i 'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences .
i joined unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in india .
`` i said , `` '' i 'm here to sell a lot of soap . '' '' and he said , `` '' no , you 're here to change lives . '' '' you 're here to change lives . ''
we are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people .
take another example , i was walking around in one of our villages in india .
our food chain , our brilliant products — and i 'm sorry i 'm giving you a word from the sponsors — knorr , hellman 's and all those wonderful products .
we were the first to embrace that , and it 's all because we market soap and soup .
`` we introduced something called the unilever sustainable living plan , which said , `` '' our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace , and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020 . '' '' now the question here is , where do we go from here ? ''
there are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this .
i have faced head-on these places , and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that 's ever happened to me .
it is protected by the antarctic treaty , signed in 1959 .
`` can they not join the dots and think , `` '' why is the ice actually melting ? '' '' this is such an amazing place , the antarctic , and i have worked hard for the last 23 years on this mission to make sure that what 's happening up here in the north does never happen , can not happen in the south . ''
where did this all begin ?
i found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties when i was at university .
beneath our feet , 90 percent of all the world 's ice , 70 percent of all the world 's fresh water .
on this journey , we faced the danger of crevasses , intense cold , so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing , your teeth can crack , water can freeze in your eyes .
let 's just say it 's a bit chilly . ( laughter ) and after 70 desperate days , we arrive at the south pole .
it was a bit of a shock — ( laughter ) — and it started me thinking .
( applause ) and 1,000 kilometers away from the safety of land , disaster strikes .
back then , we had to march or die .
and when — i love my mum .
to look after antarctica , you 've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place , form a relationship , form a bond , form some love .
and it 's not good news .
good on him , barney .
`` `` '' if you can do , or dream you can , begin it now , for boldness has genius , power and magic in it . '' '' good luck to you all . ''
well , it 's the era of a lot of different things that we 're in right now . but one thing for sure : it 's the era of change . there 's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth .
and i 've tried to put together something that 's a good start for this .
and this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we , humans , are in charge of life on earth ; we 're like the capricious gods of old greek myths , kind of playing with life — and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it .
there 's no need to see the little detailed words on it .
and so if you 're looking for growth industries to get into , that 's not a good one — protecting natural creatures . human population is going up ; it 's going to continue for quite a while .
we ca n't go into that today because there is n't time — it 's a broad subject . one thing for sure , in the future there is an essential feature — necessary , but not sufficient — which is doing more with less . we 've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy , less material .
narrator : a tiny airplane , the av pointer serves for surveillance — in effect , a pair of roving eyeglasses . a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle . it is convenient to carry , assemble and launch by hand . battery-powered , it is silent and rarely noticed .
humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy . sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles , and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet .
it 's amazing : just on the puny power of the sun — by having a super lightweight plane , you 're able to get it up there .
so matt keenan , just any time you 're — all right — ready to let her go . but first , we 're going to make sure that it 's appearing on the screen , so you see what it sees .
pm : but now we 're trying to get the video . there we go .
but now , as they say in infomercials , we have something much better for you , which we 're working on : planes that are only six inches — 15 centimeters — in size .
this one does n't have the video in it , but you get a little feel from what it can do .
where all this leads , i do n't know . is it practical ? i do n't know .
sort of a timeline , very non-linear scale , nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs , and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... birds were flying overhead , after pterosaurs .
and then we get to the civilization above the little tv set with a gun on it . then traffic jams , and power systems , and some dots for digital . where it 's going to lead — i have no idea .
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . this is not a forecast .
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it 's about a gram .
( applause ) and you wonder , is it practical ? and it turns out if i had not been — ( laughter ) ( applause ) unfortunately , we have some light bulb changes .
so i think that , as a symbol , it 's important .
something called the danish twin study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives , within certain biological limits , is dictated by our genes .
there is what oprah tells us .
there is what doctor oz tells us .
and does purpose play into it ?
and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
so to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
five times as many centenarians as we have in america .
we know that isolation kills .
fifteen years ago , the average american had three good friends .
and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to arizona to play golf .
adventists are conservative methodists .
for 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how stressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their god , their social network , and then , hardwired right in the religion , are nature walks .
this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham .
she starts her day with lifting weights .
`` `` '' a stranger is a friend i have n't met yet ! '' '' she 'd say to me . ''
and we managed to boil it down to nine .
every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk .
instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the american population .
they put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
or , i go to a show and i see a beautiful piece by an artist , particularly beautiful , i say he 's so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do .
but in truth , what i really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of moma is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot , like this beautiful chair by dirk vander kooij , where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur of recycled refrigerator parts , as if he were a big candy , and makes a chair out of it .
but also , more recently , we started acquiring video games , and that 's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way . ( laughter ) there are still people that believe that there 's a high and there 's a low .
i love them . so we are in the right quadrant .
we are in the highbrow — that 's daring , that 's courageous — and brilliant , which is great .
so my knight in shining armor , john maeda , without any prompt , came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the moma .
and you know what ?
even in the 1930s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art .
and the same with , for instance , tetris , original version , the soviet one .
you know , with your mitt you can actually paw the metrocard , and i talk about how bad atm machines usually are .
i 've never made it into a planet , but that 's it .
and it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music .
so you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like moma 's are kept alive also by the selection of these games .
but we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design , so maybe one day we 'll be able to acquire also the guns .
so it was not very constructive . ( laughter ) so , i 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
it 's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature .
then we have a few also side-scrollers — classical ones .
what we want , what we aspire to , is the code .
they 're not going to get rid of us .
time . the way we experience time in video games , as in other forms of interaction design , is really quite amazing .
so the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox . you see them here displayed alongside other examples of design , furniture and other parts , but there 's no paraphernalia , no nostalagia , only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers .
i would like to do the same with video games .
it was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain .
so in a way , we 're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
i 'm a man who 's trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
it 's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations .
when i was nine years old , president mandela came to stay with my family .
or , people are not people without other people .
we worked together as a team .
because of the heat , i took my shoes off , and i rolled up my pants , and i walked into the water .
and a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
as it bites the second time , i kick .
my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
the meat is torn up .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
this is the other thing about solly , he 's freakishly strong .
ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
and that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her , it was this sense of kinship .
and then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
( applause ) pat mitchell : so boyd , we know that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today , and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world .
i 'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern .
biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds , and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the la plata basin .
it completely passes below the radar screen .
today , the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor , the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods , to feed their families .
so is this just a story from south thailand ?
and they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations , what are the externalities ?
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
that was in the early 2000s when india was going gung-ho about gdp growth as the means forward — looking at china with its stellar growths of eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering , why can we do the same ?
it was associated largely with the construction industry .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
the other favorite , if you like , solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .
and by the way , these are my favorites — externalities calculation and green carbon markets .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
but the thing is to do a lot more of that .
and the sad thing is that , as these coral reefs are lost — and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs — we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species , the warm water corals , we 're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans , but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries .
i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding .
such a service simply do not exist .
even though it pricked my conscience then , i could not , or rather i did not tend to her or assist her , because i was busy building my real estate company .
a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , battling small- and large-scale corruption , including the one perpetrated by india 's biggest corporate scamster .
`` as my close friend replied , when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs , i quote : `` '' of course we can not fail in this , at least in our own minds . ''
sm : so let me ... let me give you an example .
and he did not want to pay .
`` some people actually come back and say , `` oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do . '' ''
age demographics : the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s , when the baby boomers were still young .
and we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily .
they aggregate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories .
will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ?
but my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it 's probably a good idea that you figure out what they 're passionate about , what amuses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
thank you so much .
this is what a classroom in a public school in india looks like .
and even for me , who 's lived in india all her life , walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking .
by the time kids are 11 , 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover .
by the time kids are 13 or 14 , they tend to drop out of schools .
that 's a huge statement on how broken the indian public education system is .
so it was with that background that i got a call in the summer of 2013 from an absolutely brilliant lady called surina rajan .
`` so she said to us , `` '' look , i 've been heading this department for the last two years . ''
`` can you possibly help ? '' '' let me describe haryana a little bit to you . ''
`` so i said , `` '' hang on , stop . ''
now the specifics of the goal do n't matter here , but what matters is how specific the goal is .
because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement .
but they were not teaching .
i went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet supervised .
i went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids ' accounts .
`` when my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters , these are exactly the things which are discussed . '' '' you see , what had happened was , over the last two decades , india had been fighting the challenge of access , having enough schools , and enrollment , bringing children into the schools . ''
and now , what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach .
and we realized that unless we change those specific things , we could do a number of other things .
small things being done by ngos , being done by foundations .
and in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in , those additional resources actually create a difference .
we needed another solution .
one day , one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students .
`` so what happens now in the textbooks in haryana is that after every concept , we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say , `` '' to teach this concept , here 's an activity that you can do . ''
it spreads like wildfire .
teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously .
and schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations .
but not in haryana .
( applause )
it 's great being here at ted .
beauty and seduction , i believe , is nature 's tool for survival , because we will protect what we fall in love with .
`` and i thought that they 'd probably say , `` '' well , it 's all about sex . '' '' and chip taylor , our monarch butterfly expert , he replied , `` '' nothing lasts forever . ''
`` everything in the universe wears out . '' '' and that blew my mind . ''
but i want to start and go back to the 1930s .
long before a little thing called twitter , radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast .
and of course , today , we have an entirely new medium to play with , which is this online world .
this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them .
every night , at 8 p.m. , you could tune in to a short story from the new yorker 's fiction account .
as you begin to play with flexible identity online , it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world .
i double checked the newspapers .
it ended , a true narrative conclusion .
one of my favorite examples of something that 's happening on twitter right now , actually , is the very absurdist crimer show .
and there are all these times where crimer , the supercriminal , does all of these tv things .
realtimewwii is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail , as if you were reading the news reports from that day .
so with real-time storytelling , blurring the lines between fact and fiction , the real world and the digital world , flexible identity , anonymity , these are all tools that we have accessible to us , and i think that they 're just the building blocks .
that 's more in a single day than all three major u.s. networks broadcast in the last five years combined .
now , unfortunately , there 's no school that offers the course designing for humanity 101 .
`` the team at facebook that manages the facebook `` '' like '' '' button decided that it needed to be redesigned . ''
this is purely hypothetical , i can assure you .
so they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down .
they had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel .
so i find this hypothetical photo of myself , and it 's not spam , it 's not abuse , but i really wish it were n't on the site .
why do n't you like this photo of yourself ?
`` now i do n't know who the other 10 percent are , but maybe that 's where our `` '' unfriend '' '' feature can come in handy . ''
the next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change , you need to do it extraordinarily carefully .
now , when you set a goal to design for the entire human race , and you start to engage in that goal in earnest , at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you 're living in .
so how do we keep this big , big picture in mind ?
so what does it mean to design at a global scale ?
finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting , and the humility part , it 's a little tough on the design ego .
the comments began pouring in , and okolloh would collate them . she would post them .
and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity .
this is one of the participatory — one of the participatory models we see coming out of that , along with ushahidi .
but media abundance never works that way .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
and so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in haifa , israel .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
`` boom . no ifs , ands or buts . '' '' and the minute they did that , the behavior in those daycare centers changed . ''
they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .
and critically , the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did .
the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow , and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead — a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century .
what 's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur .
so there 's only 27 people per square mile , which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer .
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .
the brain drain — where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back .
so bertie county is not only very rural ; it 's incredibly poor .
so in february of 2009 , dr. zullinger invited us , project h design — which is a non-profit design firm that i founded — to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .
but this is our front porch . we live there .
and so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool , something that bertie county did n't otherwise have , and to be sort of the — to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit .
you come in , you face the wall , you take your test and you leave .
and this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape .
he came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself .
it 's hands-on , it 's in-your-face , it requires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .
so the first project , which will be built next summer , is an open-air farmers ' market downtown , followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year .
she is 15 years old .
so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .
and let 's face it , designers , we need to reinvent ourselves .
after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak , eat or drink , i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) ce : i was optimistic , and all was right with the world .
two weeks later , i was ready to return home .
dean ornish : at first for a long time , i wrote messages in notebooks .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i 'd heard .
it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark .
i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer .
roger 2.0 : oprah , i ca n't tell you how great it is to be back on your show .
when i heard it the first time , it sent chills down my spine .
when i read something , it will read in my voice .
the flow is n't natural .
but so far , the apple alex voice is the best one i 've heard .
as a local newspaper reporter still in high school , i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato .
the point is plato was only 50 years ago , an instant in time .
i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model 100 's .
and because of it , i can communicate as well as i ever could .
we use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others .
but online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
( laughter ) ( applause ) it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles .
people — ( applause ) people talk loudly — i 'm so sorry .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
i have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way .
( laughter ) google him and he will make you laugh .
`` the psychiatrist says , `` '' you 're crazy . '' '' the guy says , `` '' i want a second opinion . '' '' the psychiatrist says , `` '' all right , you 're ugly . '' '' ( laughter ) you all know the test for artificial intelligence — the turing test . ''
( laughter ) this is the natural posture of a man sitting , squatting for ventilation purposes . ( laughter )
and be careful , your genes are in danger .
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop — ( laughter ) i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
this is a research which was done in '86 , but it 's still valid .
and this is what the young generation says .
anybody feels threatened , anybody really need it ?
( laughter ) so , sorry — it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting .
and they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away .
it arrived in london in 1832 , and every four or five years another epidemic would take 10,000 , 20,000 people in london and throughout the u.k .
and so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing .
and he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies , but nothing had really stuck .
so it was this incredibly terrifying event .
as you get further and further away from the pump , the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .
and so , with the help of this map , and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did , eventually , actually , the authorities slowly started to come around .
but because of what snow did , because of this map , because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map , we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people , cities like this one are in fact sustainable things .
the authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable , but people believe these to be imbued with power , or even magic .
i then took the fragments of these and created molds , and cast them first in wax , and finally in bronze like the image you see here , which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars .
while showing in berlin last year , a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings .
i 'll give you an example .
if this email shows up — how many of you have gotten an email like this , right ?
what do you think makes more money in the united states than movies , game parks and baseball combined ?
my phone is a slot machine .
`` every time i check my email , i 'm playing the slot machine , saying , `` '' what am i going to get ? '' '' every time i scroll a news feed , i 'm playing the slot machine to see , what am i going to get next ? ''
we want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it , and we 're going to need help from designers , because knowing this stuff does n't help .
so what would that look like ?
nancy 's on the left and she 's working on a document , and john 's on the right .
the more interruptions we get externally , it 's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves .
we actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes .
so we upgraded the goal .
now , do designers actually care about this ?
do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are ?
he joked in our conversation that what if , instead of a spell check , you had a compassion check , meaning , you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive — perceived as abrasive by someone else .
well , the answer is yes , and one of my favorites is couchsurfing .
so , great service — what would their design goal be ?
that 's a pretty good goal .
so what 's the deeper , human goal ?
so what they do is , let 's say you take two people who meet up , and they take the number of days those two people spent together , and then they estimate how many hours were in those days — how many hours did those two people spend together ?
`` and what you were left with is something they refer to as `` '' net orchestrated conviviality , '' '' or , really , just a net `` '' good times '' '' created . ''
we said this is a different kind of food .
what if we had something whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life ?
imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores .
walmart did n't have organic food until the consumer demand was there .
thank you .
but they did n't release their energy in light .
all that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the universe explode in gravitational waves .
1.3 billion years ago , earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life .
we ca n't use them to make simple images of things out in the universe .
and at least for ligo , the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band .
it 's a way that lets us hear the universe and hear the invisible .
( applause )
`` now , when they implemented this new policy , a lot of people , my colleagues and friends , came up to me and they said , `` '' wow , now that 's really unusable . ''
`` why are they doing this to us , and why did n't you stop them ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , you know what ? ''
now , the national institute of standards and technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy , but they do n't have anything too specific , and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they do n't actually have any good data on passwords .
how long is it ? does it have a digit ?
now , this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down , because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers .
we also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords .
so cmu allows 32 possible symbols , but as you can see , there 's only a small number that most people are using , so we 're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords .
so we did this , and we collected 5,000 passwords , and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with .
we also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating , but as you may recall , there is n't a good measure of password strength .
they look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets , and they guess those first .
another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter .
you may have seen these on the internet when you were creating passwords .
they tell you you 're doing a good job too early , and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback , you probably would have better passwords .
people were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords , and because the pass phrases are longer , they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in .
they audited our code .
are they disney princess fans ?
or we think about things that make us happy , and we create our password based on things that make us happy .
`` i started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when i wrote `` '' smart mobs , '' '' and i found that when i finished the book , i kept thinking about it . ''
and then another communication technology enabled new media : the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
now of course , the enabling technologies are based on the internet , and in the many-to-many era , every desktop is now a printing press , a broadcasting station , a community or a marketplace .
neither one wants to be the first one or they 're going to get the sucker 's payoff , but both lose , of course , because they do n't get what they want .
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma ; in fact , the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner 's dilemma .
and most recently , neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .
they 're enriching others , not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves .
`` instead of , `` '' neither of us can trust each other , so we have to make suboptimal moves , '' '' it 's , `` '' you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate . '' '' wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years . ''
in the u.s. , in the philippines , in kenya , around the world , citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms .
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking .
thank you .
and that 's the norwegian media in a nutshell : not much drama .
a few years back , norway 's public tv channel nrk decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride — seven hours of simple footage , a train rolling down the tracks .
in the lunchroom .
`` the bergen railway had its 100-year anniversary that year it goes from western norway to eastern norway , and it takes exactly the same time as it did 40 years ago , over seven hours . ( laughter ) so we caught our commissioning editors in oslo , and we said , we want to make a documentary about the bergen railway , and we want to make it in full length , and the answer was , `` yes , but how long will the program be ? '' ''
this is norway 's most important drill right now .
it regulates the height of a bow camera in nrk 's live production , one of 11 that capture great shots from the ms nord-norge .
th : another camera is this one . it 's normally used for sports .
and we also , on the web , during this week we streamed more than 100 years of video to 148 nations , and the websites are still there and they will be forever , actually , because hurtigruten was selected to be part of the norwegian unesco list of documents , and it 's also in the guinness book of records as the longest documentary ever .
but it 's a long program , so some watched part of it , like the prime minister .
so we could either take something long and make it a topic , like with the railway and the hurtigruten , or we could take a topic and make it long .
it actually took three hours before we got the first fish , and that 's quite slow .
this is from the colbert report on comedy central .
th : so , when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting , why not knitting ?
so this is the working plan for 150 people last summer , but more important is what you do n't plan .
so this is actually the whole running order for hurtigruten , 134 hours , just written on one page .
we did n't know anything more when we left bergen .
and where is that cow going ?
`` basically , `` '' emergence '' '' was published on 9/11 . ''
if they had n't been crowded — you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the twin towers , and you can see that very powerfully .
and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days .
and i walked out , and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter , which was that the streets were completely alive with people .
and i thought , well , this is the power of a city .
`` but nothing really says this model of interactivity — which was so exciting and captures the real , the web zeitgeist of 1995 — than `` click here for a picture of my dog . '' ''
you can also rank it by the latest posts .
and that was one of the reasons why the web was n't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking , you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .
so it 's much closer , in a way , to a data fungus , in a sense , wrapped around that page , than it is to a deliberate link that i 've placed there .
now , what you 're having here is basically a global brain that you 're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it 's thinking .
that 's not necessarily something we did n't know already .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person 's google share of that term .
no , that 's not true .
( laughter ) i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola mola fish . ( laughter )
i also did — and i do n't want to start a little fight in the next panel — but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
so right here — now this is a big category , you have smaller percentages , so this is 0.7 percent — dan dennett , who 'll be speaking shortly .
so dennett 's in the lead a little bit there .
and right behind him is l. ron hubbard . so — ( laughter ) you can see we 're in the ascot , which is always good .
another quick thing — this is a slightly different thing , but this analysis some of you may have seen .
that 's britney spears . i mean , you know , ok , interesting .
so you know , you can actually download — it 's hard to remember those .
the question now — and this is the really interesting question — is , what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem — and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge .
it 's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man , one modem democracy , where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .
and so what dave sifry at technorati started working on , literally as shirky started — after he published his piece — was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers .
and it creates a kind of planned emergence .
so the most wonderful thing , i think , about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we 're having the conversation .
100 years later .
in other cities , they required two jitney drivers for one jitney .
( laughter ) all right . so what happened ?
because , well , when you ca n't share a car , then you have to own one .
in china by 2011 , there were more car sales happening in china than in the us .
and so we started thinking about , well , how do we make those two trips and turn them into one .
because if we did , that ride would be a lot cheaper — up to 50 percent cheaper — and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars .
and so the big question for us was : would it work ?
and so we rolled it out in los angeles eight months ago .
`` but the part that i 'm really — ( applause ) but my favorite statistic — remember , i 'm from la , i spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel , going , `` '' how do we fix this ? '' '' — my favorite part is that eight months later , we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week . ''
and so uberpool is a very great solution for urban carpooling .
but what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in los angeles ?
thank you .
( applause ) chris anderson : travis , thank you .
ca : how did it go ?
what we saw is a lot of people — actually , at the beginning , we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it .
and our numbers were slightly up from what we expected .
did you notice a loss of business ?
now , inside , we felt like — i guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work , but on the outside that was n't evident .
how — you know , you said that you started this originally — just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride .
and what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off , they 're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in .
`` so even in new york — we have a blog post we call `` '' 4 septembers '' '' — compare the earnings september after september after september . ''
same month every year .
tk : well , look , i think the first part is it 's going to take — it 's likely going to take a lot longer than i think some of the hype or media might expect .
are there ways to have education systems , vocational training , etc. , for that transition period .
it will take a lot longer than i think we all expect , especially that transition period .
and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life .
`` and then the second step is to say , `` the situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . '' ''
it does increase security .
it needs to be a decade-long approach , rather than just a couple of years .
you can do that quite fast .
( laughter ) so the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
governments snatch short-term opportunities and , by the end of the conflict , the chickens have come home to roost .
so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy .
one is jobs .
one is improvements in basic services — especially health , which is a disaster during conflict .
those are the three critical priorities .
what is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations ?
there is n't any construction going on . and so the sector shrivels away .
often the legal system is broken down so you ca n't even get access to land .
secondly you need skills , the mundane skills of the construction sector .
and it 's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that 's not a realistic agenda , and so what they also do is the total bypass : just fund ngos .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
and so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem .
the emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks , because there would n't be any money in taking part in the politics .
so think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
but were you to walk in the opposite direction , this entire sequence happens in reverse .
when you think of a cave , most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock , and in fact , that 's how most caves are .
now these days , with so many people hiking around , it 's pretty hard to find a new cave , so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of oregon 's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before .
the name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the sandy glacier .
back in 2011 , brent saw a youtube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves .
this is me looking into the entrance crevasse .
we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end , and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out .
then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
the inside of it was coated with ice , so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping .
the ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up .
this duck died on the surface of the glacier long , long ago , and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave .
every year , new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before .
thank you very much .
in the summer of 2003 , i was assigned to command a special operations task force , and that task force was spread across the mideast to fight al qaeda .
who needed , who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed ?
the fact that i know something has zero value if i 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
it was the fundamental shift , not new tactics , not new weapons , not new anything else .
thank you .
just like snowflakes , no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on earth .
it 's mother nature 's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment .
now , i live in vancouver , near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall .
but the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on earth .
or , the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees .
that 's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year .
it just happens to be that mother nature holds the patent , and we do n't really feel comfortable with it .
buildings are starting to go up around the world .
( applause )
`` and they say , `` '' i want to work in global poverty , but what will it mean about my career ? ''
and tragically , in 1999 , when she was in colombia working with the u'wa people , focused on preserving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc .
but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end .
one of the acumen fund fellows at my organization , suraj sudhakar , has what we call moral imagination — the ability to put yourself in another person 's shoes and lead from that perspective .
and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they 're reading many ted authors and liking it .
and then they created a business plan competition .
but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit .
but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action .

but there 's only one mosque .
`` and so i asked jawad , `` '' how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community . ''

( laughter ) so let me tell you about a hollywood party i went to a couple years back , and i met this up-and-coming actress , and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about : public art .
he had workout regime he did every day .
that 's what opportunity-makers do .
years after that , he was teaching the racquetball teachers .
( laughter ) jeff and i were full-time ballroom dance instructors when the big tv ballroom revival hit , and this was incredible .
there 's one thing that stayed consistent , though : the man leads and the woman follows .
it 's like shakespeare : respect it , revive it — great !
this does n't represent how we think today .
only .
ever .
he dictates , she reacts .
( music ) ( applause ) jf : now , you just saw two men dancing together .
aesthetically speaking , if alida and i take the classic closed ballroom hold ...
this is considered beautiful .
( laughter ) but why not this ? ( laughter )
tc : so we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle .
what if we could dance like that ?
with this simple tweak , the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation .
anyone can lead . anyone can follow .
i mean , beyond the unusual sight of seeing two men dancing together , it always evokes and engages .
just be yourself .
i started with money .
the math is not all that advanced , and really it 's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle .
and there are some things i did n't look at .
that gives you an idea of where they have people .
but i came up with my estimate , which i felt pretty good about , that was about 10 exabytes of data across all of google 's operations , and then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in tape drives , which it turns out google is about the world 's largest consumer of .
and i posted it on my website . i wrote it up .
and i did n't expect to get an answer from google , because of course they 've been so secretive , they did n't answer of my questions , and so i just put it up and said , well , i guess we 'll never know .
so i go and get it , open it up , and it 's punch cards . ( laughter ) google-branded punch cards .
so i get some software and start reading it , and scan them , and it turns out it 's a puzzle .
and i have a lot of stupid questions , and i love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes .
and sometimes not .
( applause )
in this image of the tokyo skyline , i 've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block , the kepler mission .
when we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things .
but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
while it 's kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it 's we , life , who are searching .
( applause )
all the young people , actually , from the city .
and of course , in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it , and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets .
and i did n't give the talk always . you did , and we had to watch you , and so forth .
and we 're all still trying to , i guess we 're all trying to become tedsters , if that 's a modern form of enlightenment .
because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do , a little bit tired , we do suffer .
`` i need a hundred billion . '' '' so i 'm like that . ''
i , me , me , mine . it 's like a perfect song , that song . a perfect teaching .
you know , the big communist revolutions , russia and china and so forth .
they did n't help at all .
i wo n't even say what they do . but he feels it .
he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings .
no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh .
what did it do ?
it also made all those people who roamed around the desert — looking for water , looking for food , trying to take care of their livestock — urbanize .
there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak .
and we realized that there are some differences in accents .
that is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
do you worry much ?
and so that number also demands food .
and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by 2050 .
indeed there is .
this slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
we are only 60 years old , but we want to live forever as a city , to live in peace .
and i would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with .
i grew up in a log cabin in washington state with too much time on my hands .
( laughter ) fn : and i brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across australia — also the u.s. and japan .
yb : so , wind power , solar power — we had a lot to talk about .
( applause )
( applause ) however , gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
i met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
we did not prioritize right .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in libya .
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
we need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
`` in turn , the word `` '' raheem , '' '' which is known in all abrahamic traditions , has the same root in arabic as the word `` '' rahem '' '' — womb — symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from . ''
and as it turns out , it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history .
i mean , certainly mammals did . this is one example .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
a predator . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored .
this was the cover of science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same . anyway , smaller raptors .
we had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale .
man : look at that set of choppers ! yeah , he 's a big one .
man 2 : you have the back legs ? no , you have the front legs , my friend .
i 've got it . i 've got the back legs .
this is a ceremonial disk .
and then work later is going to take us to tibet .
we ca n't predict , necessarily , what will happen in evolution , but we can learn some of the rules of the game , and that 's really what we 're trying to do .
with regard to the biogeographic question , the earth is dividing .
but there 's one thing that 's even more important , and i think that 's extinction .
this is a computer program which has three knobs .
several teachers nearly killed me .
i read a dictionary . i got into college .
it became abstract .
i mean , is there anything that is not visualizing what ca n't be seen , in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that 's out there , or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another ?
niger is equally important , and i 'm trying desperately to do something in niger .
and i hope to god the united states government , me , or ted , or somebody helps us do that , because that would be an incredible thing for their country .
it 's going to be part-school , part-museum hall , part-conservatory , part-zoo , and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science .
so we all are africans , and welcome home .
and evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old — beads .
and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material .
because it 's only when you do that , that you can talk about — ( laughter ) — it 's only when you do that , [ that ] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
anyway , once we made it there , then it 's a game park , as i said , an extinct game park .
it was then , after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam , and you see the face here covered by sandstone .
how ?
you know , in primates , there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism , which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females .
we want to know how they looked like , how they behaved , how they walked around , and how they lived and grew up .
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
and second , she tells us that she walked upright , but had some adaptation for tree climbing .
you spend more time with your parents .
`` maybe you 're wondering , `` '' so , you see this ape feature , human feature , ape feature . ''
`` what does that tell us ? '' '' you know , that is very exciting for us , because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively , and that evolution is in the making . ''
to summarize the significance of this fossil , we can say the following .
they do n't preserve well , as you know .
that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children , so i think the new fossil fixes this problem .
of course , in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human , you know , the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years — and there are more than 10 — they did not have the knowledge , the technology and sophistications that we , homo sapiens , have today .
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa .
that 's what i call positive african attitude .
( applause )
you can go to webat25.org and find some links .
over the last two decades , india has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services , as we call it , and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in india , offshoring software development and back office services , there 's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to india .
now , what we were trying to understand was , is this true ?
so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question , and the right question is , really , can indians based out of india do innovative work ?
the first type of invisible innovation out of india is what we call innovation for business customers , which is led by the multinational corporations , which have — in the last two decades , there have been 750 r & d centers set up in india by multinational companies employing more than 400,000 professionals .
interestingly , what he finds is — and by the way , the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations : how many times does a future patent reference the older patent ? — he finds something very interesting .
but of course , when you climb onto the boeing 787 , you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of india .
process innovation is different from product innovation .
it 's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the west .
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow .
right ? and the last thing we point out in this slide , which is , you know , that to this story , there 's one caveat .
india has the youngest growing population in the world .
there are 433,000 people now at ibm , out of which 98,000 are remaining in the u.s. , and 150,000 are in india .
( cheering ) my parents were radicals — ( laughter ) who became , well , grown-ups .
`` my dad facetiously says , `` '' we wanted to save the world , and instead we just got rich . '' '' we actually just got `` '' middle class '' '' in colorado springs , colorado , but you get the picture . ''
when i was just a little girl , my mom started what is now the longest-running women 's film festival in the world .
( applause ) he 's actually here today . ( applause )
anyone heard of these two guys as an example ?
`` my mom says , `` '' patriarchy . '' '' i say , `` '' intersectionality . '' '' so race , class , gender , ability , all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman . ''
feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of walmart .
`` and one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say , `` '' i googled jessica simpson and stumbled on your site . ''
it 's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
i was fired up ; i was ready to make a difference .
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory , or certainty , or security even .
( applause )
day five , they ran out of penicillin , and the poor man died .
now , the analogy here is , perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics , and if you think about it , what are good substitutes for antibiotics ?
and certainly consumer education works .
and we have to bring an example from across the pond .
the alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon .
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada , and dropped out of high school . i do n't own a cell phone , and i paint on paper using gouache , which has n't changed in 600 years .
`` i called it `` '' serious nonsense '' '' because on the serious side , i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid . i copied it and i never unlearned it — it 's the only style i know . and it 's very kind of staid and formal . ''
this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor — which you ca n't see there .
my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it .
and technology was going to carry us along .
the zeppelin — this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the hindenburg .
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
so the hindenburg was n't , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
this is emblematic of it — this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . you ca n't see it very well here , but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away .
it 's obviously modeled on the titanic .
it 's just a sick , silly joke .
this is a very un-pc cover . not in new york .
this is a tiny joke — e-zr pass . one letter makes an idea .
`` her former name was fay wray , and so that was — i did n't have the wit to say , `` '' take the painting . '' '' finally , this was a three-page cover , never done before , and i do n't think it will ever be done again — successive pages in the front of the magazine . ''
so thank you very much .
( laughter ) ss : and my personal favorite is frankenstein 's monster .
a few years ago , i made this educational video about the history of video games .
i recorded my audio , but every time i sat down to edit , i just could not do it .
and then everybody would laugh .
since then , i 've thought a lot about what it means to be normal .
but a color like blue , which was much harder to make — many cultures did n't begin to learn how to make that color until much later .
so until then , even though a color might be all around them , they simply did not have the ability to see it .
it 's delicious !
( applause )
we have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders .
meanwhile , our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade .
connectivity is how we optimize the distribution of people and resources around the world .
i believe that is what is happening .
and these are not mere little dots on the map , but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers .
the sprawl of los angeles now passes san diego across the mexican border to tijuana .
america 's northeastern megalopolis begins in boston through new york and philadelphia to washington .
for now .
but in china , megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching 100 million people .
our traditional map of 200 discrete nations that hang on most of our walls , or this map of the 50 megacity clusters ?
and yet , even this is incomplete because you can not understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others .
it too represents just over a third of south africa 's gdp .
they know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries .
now , for many people , urbanization causes great dismay .
that is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have .
and all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose , mankind 's number one priority in the 21st century : sustainable urbanization .
in major chinese cities , they 're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets .
no , not yet .
( applause ) and that is why infrastructure has just been included in the united nations sustainable development goals , because it enables all the others .
we all know the story of europe after world war ii , where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today 's peaceful european union .
and that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today .
but now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet .
but we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run .
since the end of the cold war , a quarter century ago , at least six major wars have been predicted for this region .
and even the election of a nationalist party in taiwan that 's pro-independence earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic .
japanese cars are selling in record numbers there .
they 're building a trade corridor stretching from northeast india through myanmar and bangladesh to southern china .
ladies and gentlemen , i can not guarantee that world war iii will not break out .
and that is why their leaders think twice , step back from the brink , and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions .
`` it 's the sequel to `` '' an inconvenient truth , '' '' and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis . ''
and if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
( audio ) al gore : i consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they 're a beautiful addition to the landscape .
so you can open this one .
or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing .
but one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics .
this one shows the wind potential all around the united states .
and this whole book , it does n't just run on the ipad .
( applause ) chris anderson : that 's spectacular .
mm : yeah , we 're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content .
the bridge is an iconic structure , known worldwide for its beautiful views of san francisco , the pacific ocean , and its inspiring architecture .
but let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide .
i do n't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face .
i responded , and when i arrived , i observed jason speaking to a golden gate bridge officer .
`` recalling your greek mythology , zeus created pandora , and sent her down to earth with a box , and told her , `` '' never , ever open that box . '' '' well one day , curiosity got the better of pandora , and she did open the box . ''
`` jason then asked us , `` '' what happens when you open the box and hope is n't there ? '' '' he paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone . ''
the next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that mike 's car was down at the bridge .
kevin is straight , as he says .
`` boy , did i have to straighten that one out . '' '' today , kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society . ''
my grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .
typically , this is accomplished in just three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol , or death .
one was jason .
and he leapt .
i do want to tell you , though , the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide .
that connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should strive to do .
suicide is preventable .
this is a picornavirus .
and so took this first example , which is called coxsackievirus , and just break it into small windows .
and , likewise , we infected them with parainfluenza-3 — that 's a paramyxovirus — and you see a little barcode here .
( laughter ) you can see that this barcode is the same family , but it 's distinct from parainfluenza-3 , which gives you a very bad cold .
and so we 're getting unique signatures , a fingerprint for each virus .
rhino 's the common cold , and you all know what polio is , and you can see that these signatures are distinct .
and kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here .
how do i know which rhinovirus i have ?
and so , here are four different rhinoviruses , and you can see , even with your eye , without any fancy computer pattern-matching recognition software algorithms , that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other .
now , this is kind of a cheap shot , because i know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is , and i in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart , but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer ?
so , here are four rhinoviruses we never knew anything about — no one 's ever sequenced them — and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns .
it could have lots of bacteria , it could have more than one virus , and it certainly has host genetic material .
we sequenced part of their viruses ; they 're new rhinoviruses no one 's actually even seen .
you 're looking at her open lung biopsy .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
for maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer , there are folks that are predisposed to it .
and the viral genome i 'm showing you right here ?
its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it 's infecting a species other than mice .
we have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that 's been linked to cancer .
that 's where we 're at .
and then think about this : why ca n't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco ? ( laughter ) how is this possible ? ( laughter ) it makes no sense . ( applause ) we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do .
they had blackberries .
this is what radicals can do with openness .
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob 100 million ?
they do n't all have drumsticks .
by the way , these travel at over 600 miles an hour .
but i wonder to myself , for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up , how might they use 3d printers ?
but as these get bigger in the future , what other items will you be able to print ?
the technologies are allowing bigger printers .
criminals understand this .
of course , we 're going to go even deeper than the human body .
we 're going down to the cellular level these days .
it 's a great challenge for them .
personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons , which means you can attack any one individual , including all the people in this picture .
policing does n't scale globally . at least , it has n't , and our current system of guns , border guards , big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we 're moving .
so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats , like attacking a president or a prime minister ?
but this is not going to work .
the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial .
what happens if we were to take the president 's dna , or a king or queen 's , and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders ?
or what if we sent it out to a few thousand ?
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
how we use them is not just up to me , it 's up to all of us .
they call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement .
what 's the fastest growing threat to americans ' health ?
over the past 12 years , his condition got worse and worse , and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress .
could i please have my sock model on the stage ?
great .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
for 11 years , i was mayor of tirana , our capital .
`` `` '' well , '' '' i told him , `` '' the surroundings do not meet european standards , even though this is not what we want , but we will choose the colors ourselves , because this is exactly what we want . ''
the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost .
`` what are colors doing to us ? '' '' and we made a poll , the most fascinating poll i 've seen in my life . ''
to the first question , 63 percent of people said yes , we like it .
they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
it 's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
when people say all politicians are the same , ask yourself if obama was the same as bush , if françois hollande is the same as sarkozy .
when people say nothing can change , just stop and think what the world was like 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 years ago .
and by elevating the material and my dad 's skill , could we start to think about tar just like clay , in a new way , shaping it differently , helping us to imagine what was possible ?
i became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that were happening just outside my studio .
the building was really affordable .
because the broom was free and sweeping was free .
black cinema house , which was made from just a small piece of clay , had to grow into a much larger piece of clay , which is now my studio .
it was dirt . it was nothing . it was nowhere .
and so we just started imagining , what else could happen in this building ?
in some ways , it feels very much like i 'm a potter , that we tackle the things that are at our wheel , we try with the skill that we have to think about this next bowl that i want to make .
thank you so much .
i 've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed , they still often have a pulse .
how do you combat that viewpoint , or come against it ?
as the child grows to become an adult : so far , it has been a consumer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute , to be a contributor .
one can not contribute unless one feels secure , one feels big , one feels : i have enough .
each one has got two games .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole .
you learn swimming by swimming .
you have to act it out .
there is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion .
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the united states of america .
they 're here , getting better and better every day .
our fred astaires , our gene kellys our michael jacksons are right at our fingertips , and may not have that opportunity , except for us .
( applause ) ( video ) : madd chadd : when people first see me , i get a lot of different reactions actually .
( music ) ( applause ) j smooth : when i 'm in the zone — i 'm dancing and free styling it — i actually visually kind of picture lines , and moving them .
( music ) ( applause ) kid david : it 's kind of like , honestly a lot of times i do n't really know what 's going on when i 'm dancing .
it 's kind of like this other level where you ca n't make choices anymore , and it 's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music .
to tell the story from the inside out , versus the outside in ?
gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went .
so , i want to show the trailer , and then i 'm going to take apart one scene in detail .
it 's natural instinct .
soldier : we 've got a drive through window at burger king now .
sp : baril , do n't look at it , bud .
( applause ) deborah scranton : thank you .
paul ? come on , stand up .
and really — because maybe we 're going to disagree .
maybe it 's going to get uncomfortable .
( video ) sp : today is sport . [ unclear ] radio : [ unclear ] christian soldiers .
we do n't fucking ride with the goddam windows down .
it 's not true . very unsafe .
whoa .
they just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here .
and you know , you walk , and you hear the pieces of skin .
i later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji .
sp : we made the news .
i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass .
the way i learned about taji was steve pink sent me an email , and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car .
and i saw in my im window that mike moriarty was at the base .
and if you let time go by , it kind of softens and smooths the edges .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
and you know , you earn someone 's trust , especially in doc filmmaking , through your relationship .
`` and usually , the first questions are , `` oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? '' ''
and for me , one of the most profound stories someone shared with me , that then became my story , was — for those of you who have n't seen the film , and it 's not a spoiler — it 's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents , where people get in front of humvees and they get killed .
the gunner was throwing candy .
they used to throw candy to the kids .
`` and then i 'm going to tell her . '' '' so when i talk about a disconnect , it 's not only for maybe those people who do n't know a soldier , which there obviously are . you know , these days , it 's not like world war ii , where there was a war front and a home front , and everybody seemed involved . ''
`` and often , i 'll hear people say , who maybe know that i did this film , and they say , `` '' oh , you know , i 'm against the war , but i support the soldiers . '' '' and i 've started to ask them , `` '' well , that 's nice . what are you doing ? ''
and i would just say it 's my hope , and i would ask you guys to please , you know , reach out a hand .
`` ♫ i think i 'm ready to do my thing ♫ ♫ i think i 'm ready to take my chances ♫ ♫ i 've been dining out and all stressed out ♫ ♫ due to the circumstances . see ? ♫ ♫ i got ta get up , get up , get up , get up ♫ ♫ wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up ♫ ♫ i see what you 're saying ♫ ♫ we sent a demo to the world , they said it sounds like take 6 ♫ ♫ i said `` '' hold on , wait a minute , i 'll be back with the remix '' '' ♫ ♫ they looking at us funny , we ca n't make any money ♫ ''
that 's the percentage we recycle .
and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
a four-month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach .
hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display .
and this .
but no fishmonger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish .
we simply can not store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
this is brian rooney for nightline , in long beach , california .
charles moore : thank you .
again , we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing .
it 's spreading so quickly that it 's possible to imagine reaching billions of the world 's poor this way .
the more cash we give to the poor , and the more evidence we have that it works , the more we have to reconsider everything else we give .
thank you .
but look closely , and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science .
from the vantage point of our 21st-century biological laboratories , we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge .
the last of our kind .
we are , however , the measurers of many things .
now let that sink in for a second .
what is even more tragic is that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there , but their biology remains sorely under-studied .
and there are animals out there that do truly astounding things .
but like all good magicians , they 're not really releasing their secrets readily to me .
these animals did not get the memo .
so if we 're going to study animals that break the rules , should n't how we study them also break the rules ?
stanford , i majored in ecology and evolution .
the brown administration , and a bunch of my friends , basically leveled the energy efficiency of california , so it 's the same now , 30 years later , even though our economy has gone up 80 percent , per capita .
and we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state .
by mid-century we 'll be about 80 percent urban , and that 's mostly in the developing world , where that 's happening .
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like .
the aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming : 1.3 million people a week coming to town , decade after decade .
they are poor , but they are intensely urban . and they are intensely creative .
the aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters , all one billion of them , are building the urban world , which means they 're building the world — personally , one by one , family by family , clan by clan , neighborhood by neighborhood .
they start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by .
and that 's how they work .
and the nations they 're in can help .
and the scale is terrific .
the main event is , these are not people crushed by poverty .
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .
they do n't even have to get rich yet . just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer , higher-quality kids , and the birthrate goes down radically .
where do you think the action is going to be ?
so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms , nuclear is about even with solar and wind , and ahead of solar — oh , i 'm sorry — with hydro and wind , and ahead of solar .
here 's the design of an early one from toshiba .
almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation-proof .
and so i would like to see the gnep program , that was developed in the bush administration , go forward aggressively .
my fellow environmentalists , on this subject , have been irrational , anti-scientific , and very harmful .
and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization .
even in the best-resourced countries in the world , this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
it is n't surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives .
and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists and psychologists , particularly in the developing world .
and it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions , then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care .
similarly , using a randomized control trial in rural pakistan , atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors , who are community maternal health workers in pakistan 's health care system , could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed , again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates . roughly 75 percent of mothers recovered as compared to about 45 percent in the comparison villages .
now for me , task shifting is an idea with truly global significance , because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries , i think it has a lot of significance for better-resourced countries as well . why is that ?
this is nasa 's famous picture of the pale blue dot .
here we are at the edge of the solar system , out at the kuiper belt .
spitzer 's suggestion was we do this in space .
we build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that 's created , and boom , we get to see planets .
this sounds formidable , but brilliant engineers , colleagues of mine at jpl , came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this .
last summer , we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman .
those petals have to rotate into place .
you can see jupiter , you can see saturn , uranus , neptune , and right there in the center , next to the residual light is that pale blue dot . that 's earth .
we want to see that , see if there 's water , oxygen , ozone , the things that might tell us that it could harbor life .
and they face limitations , constraints , they may be weak , they may be located in the wrong part of the world , they may be einstein , stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed , as was the case for ramanujan for a long time , a great mathematician but nobody noticed .
but let 's face it , the secretary of state does n't know much about iran .
there 's a good reason that we do n't do that , and there 's a good reason that using game theory and computers , we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people .
now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head .
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
they care about the outcome . they 'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible .
they 're careerists , they also care about getting credit — there 's ego involvement , they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome , or as important , if it 's their druthers , to block an outcome .
i remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate .
how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two ?
i 've taken inputs on positions and so forth , run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction , and these are the simulated dynamics , the predictions about the path of policy .
so you can see here on the vertical axis , i have n't shown it all the way down to zero , there are lots of other options , but here i 'm just showing you the prediction , so i 've narrowed the scale .
that 's where , according to my analyses , the iranians were at the beginning of this year .
it would achieve some national pride , but not go ahead and build a weapon .
that 's not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure , if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices .
these are the ayatollahs , mostly based in qom , who have great clout in the religious community , have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder , because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction , a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind .
again , whether we 're talking health policy , education , environment , energy , litigation , mergers , all of these are complicated problems that are predictable , that this sort of technology can be applied to .
we 've got 800 people in tehran who watch tedtalks .
so let 's turn that off . we 're indoors .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire 's just a foundation .
this is data from a skate park , and this is mabel davis skate park in austin , texas . ( skateboard sounds ) and the sounds you 're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park , and it sounds like chaos , but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap , but successful tricks end with a pop , whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble , and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong , and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park .
( applause ) it 's all eight hours of the cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression , and i really like this image , but a lot of people think it 's fake .
this is fairly amazing to me .
thank you . ( applause )
sw : that 's nice . can you be polite ?
e : [ squawks ] sw : yeah .
a lot of her research goes on in caves , which can get pretty dusty .
well , that 's really cool , but what einstein 's really hoping is that maybe he 'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .
einstein , would you like to ride in burt 's spaceship ?
( laughter ) little splat at the end there . einstein , did that hurt ?
e : [ bobbing head ] ( laughter ) sw : let 's get down for everybody . come on now .
einstein : ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
you were saying that you were really embarrassed , because you 're in love with a pirate ?
she thinks al gore is a really good-looking man .
and we did n't think he 'd be in town then , so einstein wanted to do something special for him .
`` so let 's see if einstein will sing `` '' happy birthday '' '' to al gore . ''
sw : again .
`` einstein , do you want to say `` '' hi '' '' to all the owls ? ''
sw : very good .
sw : and a pig ?
( laughter ) sw : what about a skunk ?
e : [ kissing noise ] sw : and what do you say when it 's time to go ?
failing that , visualized information can just look really cool .
let me point out some that i really like .
then of course , the iraq war , predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003 .
what has that cost the world ? let 's take a look at that .
let 's take a look .
bird flu .
these little green peaks are asteroid collisions .
see this line , this is a landscape for violent video games .
but april is n't a particularly massive month for video games .
data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights , and it 's all around us , and it can be mined very easily .
and , all right , i 'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit .
let me show you this .
shall we see ?
who would do that ?
so there 's a titanic amount of data out there now , unprecedented .
i 'm not quite sure i 've succeeded .
i started as a programmer , and then i worked as a writer for many years , about 20 years , in print , online and then in advertising , and only recently have i started designing .
and i 've never been to design school .
and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that 's the amount we 're actually aware of .
the eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color , shape and pattern .
it 's the language of the eye .
so that might well chime with your view that america is a sort of warmongering military machine , out to overpower the world with its huge industrial-military complex .
let 's have a look .
of course , 2.1 million .
it actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration .
they 're not as true as they could be .
this is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements .
so supplements above this line are worth investigating , but only for the conditions listed below , and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not worth investigating .
it 's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space .
so the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and i can update it in a second .
it 's kind of living .
often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly , like this one , the recent icelandic volcano .
was it the planes or the volcano , the grounded planes or the volcano ?
please meet jane .
within 24 weeks , she 's on bed rest at the hospital , being monitored for her preterm contractions .
and after many trials and tribulations and years of endeavors , we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips , except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body .
we can also engineer these systems , so they can integrate energy sources , and can have wireless transmission capabilities .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
at this moment , we gave ourselves a big mental high five .
in addition , as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital , they encouraged us to make sure that our electronics worked with typical medical adhesives that are used in a hospital .
so when we reached this point , we had some other challenges , from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective , to make sure that we could make it used practically .
well , not so fast .
in the last 50 years , global meat consumption has more than quadrupled , from 71 million tons to 310 million tons .
over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day .
so how do we fix this ?
it takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest , riots and further malnutrition .
we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos .
mission blue truly changed our lives .
every single fishing vessel combined , small and large , across the globe , together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption .
and talk about farming — for farming you need resources .
experts agree that it 's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet .
and why is that ?
they do n't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do .
( laughter ) and it needs very little water , which is counterintuitive , but as we say , it swims in it but it hardly drinks it .
it 's destroying our oceans .
the worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it .
have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean ?
salmon is a carnivore , it has no way to digest soy .
we really need a transparent food system that we can trust , that produces healthy food .
( applause )
if you go to the site of the blowout , it looks pretty unbelievable .
signs of their outrage ...
at that moment , we transcend space and time together .
i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist .
so today , i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology .
( fuse blowing ) all right . let 's start with theater .
`` there are no special effects in `` '' upwake , '' '' no artifice . ''
( applause ) thank you .
so this is , relatively , a new show that we 're now beginning to tour .
and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another .
zero does not speak , is neither man nor woman .
and zero wants to go to the moon .
there is a revolution .
it 's a human and technological revolution .
it 's conceptual . it 's universal . it 's beyond words and numbers .
we are not here to question the possible ; we are here to challenge the impossible .
in the science of today , we become artists .
( applause )
and i gave my own views ...
that paper up there had its roots in this .
vertices minus edges comes out to be zero .
does it work ? does n't it work ? and so on .
we lived on robert e. lee boulevard .
and when i was five , my parents gave me an orange schwinn sting-ray bicycle .
`` `` '' andy , andy , how are you doing ? '' '' she said , using the name of my older brother . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' i 'm bruce , '' '' i said , and promptly passed out . ''
and my doctor , on a whim , sent me to get a full-body bone scan , which showed that there was some growth in my left leg .
would they yearn for my approval , my love , my voice ?
a few days later , i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice .
`` will you help be their dad ? '' '' and i said to myself i would call this group of men `` '' the council of dads . '' '' now as soon as i had this idea , i decided i would n't tell my wife . okay . ''
because you do n't need the get-to-know-you session at that point .
and the first one was no family , only friends .
so a few weeks after my diagnosis , we went up to vermont , and i decided to put jeff as the first person in the council of dads .
get off the bus . seek out what 's different .
only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases .
and if you did see the sanjay special , you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis .
then he took my fibula from my calf , cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh , where it now lives .
because in those opening weeks , we all had nightmares .
`` one day , my daughter tybee , tybee came to me , and she said , `` '' i have so much love for you in my body , daddy , i ca n't stop giving you hugs and kisses . ''
`` and when i have no more love left , i just drink milk , because that 's where love comes from . '' '' ( laughter ) and one night my daughter eden came to me . ''
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .
`` i was like , `` '' david cries when you invite him to take a walk . '' '' ( laughter ) but he 's a literary agent , which means he 's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams do n't come true . ''
`` so one day near the end of my journey , i said , `` '' come on girls , let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge . '' '' we set out on crutches . ''
walking upright , we are told , is the threshold of what made us human .
and we encourage anybody to join this effort .
and every now and then , find a friend , find a turtle , and take a long , slow walk .
thank you very much .
( applause )
what i 'm going to offer you is a recipe , a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good , which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest .
what can we actually do ?
after the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in europe for over 40 years .
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .
partly , they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high , but it 's not just that . there 's also a range of new discoveries .
uganda has just discovered oil , in about the most disastrous location on earth ; ghana has discovered oil ; guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground .
and the short run — say , the first five to seven years — is just great .
in fact , it 's hunky dory : everything goes up .
well , the short run , it 's hunky dory , but the long run , it 's humpty dumpty .
so i thought , well , maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion .
democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies .
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
they got instant democracy in the 1990s : elections without checks and balances .
if the british treasury can be out by a factor of 10 , think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like .
why on earth are they not there ?
i grew up in a culture of self-effacement .
`` my wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks , and the blog comment said , `` '' collier is not charismatic — ( laughter ) — but his arguments are compelling . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) if you agree with that sentiment , and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry , you will realize that i need you . ''
and that was the mythology of skill .
and since richard put me on this whole thing with music — i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab — it relates a lot to music .
but i 'm going to explore skill , and juggling , and basically visual music , i guess .
i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it 's also time — where the feet were , where the balls were .
juggling three balls is simple and normal .
you can change the rhythm , if you get out of the lights .
and then you get crazy .
it 's learning skills — like being in a high-speed car crash .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
( laughter ) no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who 's got his hands around that mess , ok .
( applause ) now , what i wanted to get to is that you 're all very bright , very tactile .
ok , so since you all do n't understand what the five-ball pattern is , i 'm going to give you a little clue .
now , do me a favor : follow the ball that i ask you to follow .
you want to do it ? yeah ? ok .
little , ring , middle , index . and then open .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
ok ? so , what you 're doing is , you 're going la , la , la , and you 're getting this . ok ?
( laughter ) ok ? here we go .
( applause ) how did you do ? well ? ok. the reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face throughout their lives , a moment of learning , a moment of challenge .
it 's a moment that you ca n't make sense of .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
( laughter ) you know , what are you supposed to do ?
well , as a juggler , what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment .
another moment . ( rattling )
time . how can you look at time ?
( applause ) all right . ok. can we show the video of the triangle ?
( laughter ) the only other thing is , it was a real shock .
anyway , balance : constant movement to find an approach to stillness .
( laughter ) balance : making up the rules so you ca n't cheat , so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body .
oh , let 's see here .
( applause ) so , i 'll come back to that in a second . but working with one ball , now , what if you attach something to it , or change it .
sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with .
okay . pretty much everybody .
it tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex , and it 's generally the woman who makes more noise .
now , since darwin 's day there 's been what cacilda and i have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution , and you 're all familiar with it , even if you have n't read this stuff .
what cacilda and i have argued is that no , this economic relationship , this oppositional relationship , is actually an artifact of agriculture , which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest .
so we 've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved , until agriculture , as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex , flexible social systems , networks , that our ancestors were very good at , and that 's why our species has survived so well .
now , this makes some people uncomfortable , and so i always need to take a moment in these talks to say , listen , i 'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous , but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers .
in a hunter-gatherer band , there are no strangers .
you 've known these people your entire life .
what i 'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism .
now , in addition to being a great genius , a wonderful man , a wonderful husband , a wonderful father , charles darwin was also a world-class victorian prude .
there 's no shame associated with sexual behavior .
so there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book .
edward wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation .
ca : so a question .
that 's hot enough to melt lead .
alright .
and this was one of those cases that went on and on .
i actually found three separate recipes in the literature .
`` he said , `` '' if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made . '' '' which i thought was an interesting idea , theory . ''
and i got a copy of this dvd .
( laughter ) this is to mimic the weight of the boar . ( laughter )
( laughter ) and , interestingly , this has been observed in female macaques , but only when mounting another female . ( laughter )
this is basically a penis camera on a motor .
that is what they would do . pretty amazing .
( laughter ) and in fact , he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .
and the meme-ome , you know , quite simply , is the mathematics that underlies an idea , and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it , which i want to share with you now .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful .
so you 've got food economy and local food at the top , you 've got greenhouse gases , solar and nuclear waste .
what you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a broader concept of the environment .
and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here , and i 'll throw to eric for the next part .
there 's a talk about gratitude .
but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom .
and then , of course , there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere , in their own special place , and we call that the colleen flanagan index .
and those algorithms , whilst being kind of useful , are also very , very narrow , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear .
or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it .
and as i said , we do n't know how hard that is . it might be — after all , most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee , so we 're sort of three and a half or four times , have four times the longevity of most mammals . and in the case of the primates , we have almost the same genes . we only differ from chimpanzees , in the present state of knowledge , which is absolute hogwash , maybe by just a few hundred genes .
which , by chimpanzee standards , is very good indeed .
and i guess i better skip all the rest of this , which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and — ( laughter ) — and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you .
( applause )
but they lose , right ?
so they 're smart , but poor .
`` and these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what 's called a `` '' theory of mind '' '' circuit , or `` '' mentalizing circuit . '' '' that is , it 's a circuit that 's used to imagine what other people might do . ''
so we know that those two-step players are doing something differently .
so there 's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more .
`` they might be eligible to be on `` '' real housewives , '' '' the tv show . ''
you can see it looks different than the one before .
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
so here are some things we learned today .
( applause )
it 's something we spend about a third of our lives doing , but do any of us really understand what it 's all about ?
two thousand years ago , galen , one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world , proposed that while we 're awake , our brain 's motive force , its juice , would flow out to all the other parts of the body , animating them but leaving the brain all dried up , and he thought that when we sleep , all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back , rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind .
now , that sounds completely ridiculous to us now , but galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day .
but that does n't make a lot of sense , does it ?
and yet , it lacks lymphatic vessels , which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste wo n't work in the brain .
so the brain has this large pool of clean , clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid .
but what 's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain , they do n't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of csf .
if you think about it , using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution , because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it 's packed full of cells , so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system .
this is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain .
it 's almost nothing .
but in patients with alzheimer 's disease , amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain 's cells , instead of being cleared away like it 's supposed to be , and it 's this buildup of amyloid-beta that 's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease .
so we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared from the brain when it 's awake versus when it 's asleep , and we found that indeed , the clearance of amyloid-beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain .
but in the brain , the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops , because when it comes to cleaning the brain , it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that 's at stake , which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow .
the bad news is that 's not true .
there are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people 's heads , illnesses , etc .
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .
ah-hah .
so , he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice .
that 's a lot of women who do n't get justice .
if you 're in the u.s. , it 's mostly the blacks .
`` you ca n't have barriers , because it breaks through your prejudices , breaks through everything that you have as your mask , that says , `` '' i am this , i am that , i am that . '' '' no . it breaks through those . ''
and it reaches somewhere where other things do n't .
and in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change , we need a language that reaches through .
imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women .
and it was discovered , and who endorses this , that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over , can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through .
and here is one of the ways we get it to people .
boy : grand-dad , tell me the solution please .
( applause ) i think it 's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives .
( music ) but , what if ...
and if it 's in you , then it 's in me too . oh , dear .
want to kill that cyclist on the way to work , and string up your cousin 'cause she 's such a jerk . oh , dear .
hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who ca n't even afford to give them food .
so , what is it that we require ? what is it that we need ?
can i have my last audio track please ?
he invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling .
some whistled well .
`` no way , that 's impossible ! no no no no no ! that 's not possible . '' '' till finally one prince said , `` princess , i accept , you have defeated me . '' ''
( whistling ) thank you .
basil jones : but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hyena .
ak : haa haa haaa .
it 's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
bj : so every moment it 's on the stage , it 's making the struggle .
ak : well actually i prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
bj : his mother was a puppeteer .
bj : this is adrian and thys stander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor katherine , riding on a ladder .
bj : and the two manipulators are inside .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
ak : joey , joey , joey , joey .
he 's working the leg .
and it 's very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
you 'll notice , of course , that the puppet is made out of cane lines .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
it 's three heads making one character .
( applause ) mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me . ( applause )
i really am honored to be here , and as chris said , it 's been over 20 years since i started working in africa .
i had just left wall street , cut my hair to look like margaret mead , given away most everything that i owned , and arrived with all the essentials — some poetry , a few clothes , and , of course , a guitar — because i was going to save the world , and i thought i would just start with the african continent .
but literally within days of arriving i was told , in no uncertain terms , by a number of west african women , that africans did n't want saving , thank you very much , least of all not by me .
and so , i lived in kigali for about two and a half years , doing these two things , and it was an extraordinary time in my life .
i think the market can help us figure that out , but there 's got to be a charitable component , or i do n't think we 're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in .
it 's a nonprofit , venture capital fund for the poor , a few oxymorons in one sentence .
so that 's about 50,000 people affected .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make coartem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
samuel 's kids are in private school , and he 's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production — dignity being more important than wealth .
i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago , and some of you visited a to z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in east africa .
it 's gone from socialist tanzania into capitalist tanzania , and continued to flourish . it had about 1,000 employees when we first found it .
it costs , at manufacturing point , six dollars to produce these , and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it , so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net .
she grew up on a farm in austria , very poor , did n't have very much education .
but because she had the opportunity of the marketplace , and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education , her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams .
and my wish , when i see those women , i meet those farmers , and i think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day , is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility , and that they also can believe and get access to services , so that their children , too , can live those lives of great purpose .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
( music ) ( applause ) so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
hello .
the world does not see all people like me as champions .
i am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities , or , too often , how they do n't see them at all .
using rigorous scientific research , dr. hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer .
lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities .
special olympics also addresses critical health needs .
also , our coaches teach us about nutrition and health .
the day before our game , the nigerian basketball team went to the world games healthy athlete screening , where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time .
special olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport .
jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in newfoundland — not just special olympics , all powerlifters .
special olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves .
i hope you will think about getting involved with special olympics .
thank you very much .
well , this is about state budgets .
now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent .
so this is combining the federal level , which is the largest , the state level and the local level .
it perpetuates deficit spending .
`` it 's riddled with gimmicks . '' '' and really when you get down to it , the guys at enron never would have done this . ''
where 's the brain trust that 's in error here ?
just look at this spending .
no , they wasted their money on this . what about this thing ? — it really is quite phenomenal .
and the numbers are used to make decisions .
we need better accounting .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have .
but in fact , their work was sort of pushed off .
so we need these pieces .
but we have to draw those people in , because this is about education .
i 'm a daughter , i 'm a friend , i 'm a sister , i 'm a pupil , i 'm a cousin , i 'm a niece , i 'm a neighbor ; i 'm the employee who served everyone coffee in the café under the railway .
what i never anticipated is that almost overnight , this published letter would go viral .
`` i 'm sure i will . '' '' people around the world began tweeting under this hashtag , and the letter was republished and covered by the national press , as well as being translated into several other languages worldwide . ''
she spoke of when mandela was taken to court by the south african rugby union after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs .
in the courtroom , he went up to the south african rugby union 's lawyers , shook them by the hand and conversed with them , each in their own language .
at the time of hearing these words , i did n't really know why they were so important , but i felt they were , and i wrote them down in a notebook i had on me .
but i 've thought about this line a lot ever since .
it 's still an issue many people blame victims for .
because sometimes these questions do n't have easy answers .
and if we allow social media to deliver that , then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice , indeed .
one example among many .
but there were problems .
later when this material was translated into a common european language , which is to say latin , they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x .
and once that happened , once this material was in latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
why is it that x is the unknown ? x is the unknown
( laughter ) and i thought that was worth sharing .
and the car sped off .
he was convicted . he was sentenced to life imprisonment , and transported to folsom prison .
the other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that 's related to various brain functions but i can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line : the brain abhors a vacuum .
it happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
they retained me , as a forensic neurophysiologist , because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification , which obviously makes sense for this case , right ?
this is looking down to the east , where the shooting vehicle sped off , and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers .
so in fact , we found the same identical conditions , we reconstructed the entire thing again , he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff 's officers to protect him in this community , all right ? ( laughter ) we had him stand actually slightly in the street , so closer to the suspect vehicle , the shooter vehicle , than the actual teenagers were , so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street .
at this point , i became a little concerned .
this is what he saw .
the opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
all our memories are reconstructed memories .
they 're malleable . they 're volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they 're correct .
`` in a discussion forum for other doctors , someone took credit for `` '' twitter-bombing '' '' my account . ''
becoming a doctor was my dream .
she was one of those doctors who , if you fell and you broke your arm , she would ask you why you were n't laughing because it 's your humerus . get it ?
she went through surgery and radiation , and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book .
what i saw behind every excuse was deep fear , and what i learned was that to become a doctor , we have to put on our white coats , put up a wall , and hide behind it .
jonathan , a 28-year-old law student , says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with lgbtq patients and specializes in lgbt health .
one after another , our respondents told us that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one — that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets , they want to first understand their doctor 's values .
just because doctors have to see every patient does n't mean that patients have to see every doctor .
`` from a gastroenterologist in portland : `` '' i devoted 12 years of my life to being a slave . ''
i went to the same school as her daughter .
my parents and i trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for , and she had no need to hide from us .
i understood what her directives meant so well , but i was a physician .
i do n't hide anything from them .
they ask me how i could be so brave .
habitat would be all about gardens , contact with nature , streets instead of corridors .
we prefabricated it so we would achieve economy , and there it is almost 50 years later .
shenzhen did n't even exist as a city .
thirty years later , this is beijing today .
on the left is manhattan today : blue for housing , red for office buildings , retail .
and in the last two or three years , we 've actually been , for the first time , realizing the quality of life of habitat in real-life projects across asia .
a hundred years after we 've begun building with tall buildings , we are yet to understand how the tall high-rise building becomes a building block in making a city , in creating the public realm .
( applause )
as a kid , i used to dream about the ocean .
and i can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old , encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef .
thomas peschak conservation photographer in my 40 years on this planet , i 've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for national geographic magazine and the save our seas foundation .
and the pristine seas i used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find .
as we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth , i 've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand .
and while this approach has merits , i have come full circle .
in fact , dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively .
( music ) however , when plankton densities increase , the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains , and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after .
capturing and sharing moments like this — that reminds me why i chose my path .
now , on the other side of the peninsula lies cabo pulmo , a sleepy fishing village .
my hope is that in the future , i will have to search much , much harder to make photographs like this , while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that 's it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
`` now i had this picture taken , and it was put up on my facebook page last week , and somebody wrote in , `` huh , why does he have him standing at attention like that ? '' ''
and so i play a little game with them before i make them stand at attention .
`` and i let them go for about 10 seconds , then i go , `` '' at ease ! '' '' `` `` huh ! '' '' ( laughter ) `` yes , general . yes , general . '' ''
it gives them structure .
do n't start telling me why you did n't do something .
in 18 weeks , they have a skill . they are mature .
`` i spend a lot of time with youth groups , and i say to people , `` '' when does the education process begin ? '' '' we 're always talking about , `` '' let 's fix the schools . ''
`` that 's when you start to imprint on the child that `` '' you are special , you are different from every other child in the world . ''
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're , much to the distress of my children , they are acting just like we did . you know ? you imprint them .
i wanted to see if my memory was correct , and , my god , it was . ( laughter ) straight c everywhere .
and i say to young kids everywhere , as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you , always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing , and when you find those two things together , man , you got it .
and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority .
america has paid me . i never forget where i came from .
this is n't about taking certain guns away from all people .
we can all appreciate how brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands .
and — ( applause ) and the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the american public : 90 percent of americans support expanding brady background checks to all gun sales — including 90 percent of republicans , more than 80 percent of gun owners , more than 70 percent of nra members .
that 's about the percentage of the american public that believes the moon landing was a fake .
but what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across america ?
and every day , people are dying as a result .
and a lot of those people are children .
and i 'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in america , that moment is here .
some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably , until very recently .
we 're still outfunded , yes , by the corporate gun lobby , and ultimately that needs to change .
and we 're on offense .
you know , they say that the internet democratizes information .
it 's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like .
after that recent terrible tragedy in san bernardino , we jammed congressional switchboards .
we put 15,000 calls into congress in 24 hours .
and when they do , it 's always because the american public shakes them .
and as i was trying to think about how to end my remarks , i 'd glance up at her screen every now and then , and it seemed that every time i did , i 'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker .
and ultimately it dawned on me : what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence .
i mean , think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time , how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal — some even glamorous or sexy — have become stigmatized in just a generation or two , once they became conversations about our common ground .
there 's just something about them that works on our emotions .
rm : all right , got it ? here we go .
roman mars : according to the north american vexillological association .
i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool .
here 's why .
now when we think of our senses , we do n't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones , which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
in fact , nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .
now this is a video that i 'm going to show you of a girl who 's born deaf .
okay , play that video please .
i mean literally , they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .
back then you could n't even look at the eardrum .
girl : yes i do . i remember writing every chapter .
( laughter ) it comes in handy .
in fact , most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad .
language is very different . language is very precise .
go ahead and play this one .
most cochlear implant users can not tell the difference between an instrument .
( trumpet ) the trumpet .
the brains remain hardwired for music .
( music ) text : beethoven does n't excite her . ( music )
( trumpet ) but she jumps to action when called to duty ! ( trumpet )
and the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain .
( laughter ) and it 's one of the most awful things — heartwarming , but awful . ( laughter )
it 's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys , or vice versa for some , but it 's a little more than that .
they do pretty much everything anybody else in society does .
i was n't impulsive , i did n't react right away , because i know this is their house .
all he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately .
`` he said , `` '' yeah , i 'm good , i 'm good . '' '' we let go , he shook my hand , said he gave me my respect , gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way . ''
in some instances , we 're in it together with the c.o.s .
these c.o.s play a big factor in these young people 's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case .
a second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming .
`` that 's nicknamed `` '' gladiator school , '' '' because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they 're tough , being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs , and everybody feels that they 're tough . ''
everything that you 're about to do , i know what you 're gon na do before you do it because i already did it , and i would encourage him not to hang out with x , y and z people .
i want to make my friends understand : china is complicated .
that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world .
it 's not only to defend the chinese regime from overseas , from the universal values , but also to prevent china 's own citizens to access the global free internet , and even separate themselves into blocks , not united .
but we also use a very simple metaphor , the cat and the mouse game , to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between chinese censorship , government censorship , the cat , and the chinese internet users . that means us , the mouse .
so today i want to upgrade it to 2.0 version .
but on the other hand , they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want .
we all know mubarak is technically dead .
so these innovations and clones , as the weibo and microblogging , when it came to china in 2009 , it immediately became a media platform itself .
but also , the cat , the censorship , is not sleeping .
why ? because they have the data .
and so it 's very simple , because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy , this independent kingdom .
so chinese in china , censorship is normal .
something you find is , freedom is weird .
it 's very simple , because chinese central government does n't need to even lead the public opinion .
so my conclusion is very simple .
why are n't palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters .
woman : we saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that .
fatah party member : we must empty our minds of traditional thinking .
fatah , hamas and the popular front !
but there were others around me who were n't even cowering .
in a village called wallajeh , which sits very close to jerusalem , the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus .
they were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the west bank or jerusalem .
so we organized a screening .
so they kept on going .
the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools .
but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
this was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered .
outside haiti also , things were looking different .
we wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera — the trilogy emergency response application — which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
kibera is one of africa 's largest slums .
you can find out about the health centers .
and they are giving a voice to themselves .
my colleague , jason peat , who runs this program , tells me it 's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
we are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart , fast mobile devices .
one idea that i 'd like you to consider , for instance , is to take a look at our it departments .
we need technology as a core organizational principle .
( applause )
all of my work begins very simple .
and then i compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
these clipboards are filled with numbers .
that begins my translation process .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
you see , boiling rivers do exist in the world , but they 're generally associated with volcanoes .
and as you can see from the red dots here , which are volcanoes , we do n't have volcanoes in the amazon , nor in most of peru .
i was handed a mug , a tea bag and , well , pointed towards the river .
it was just part of their everyday life .
they drink its water .
now , after years of work , i 'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication .
your regular cup of coffee , 54 degrees c , an extra-hot one , well , 60 .
eyes , apparently , cook very quickly . they turn this milky-white color .
what 's , again , amazing are these temperatures .
but here 's the thing : the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism .
basically , it works like this : so , the deeper you go into the earth , the hotter it gets .
we refer to this as the geothermal gradient .
what is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle ?
thank you very much .
and that situation can not be right . we must do something about it .
a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
most of this is in developing countries , and the majority is in africa .
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries — not in the west — and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pains , shortness of breath , sweating ?
in a look at the map of the u.s. — the graph here , 10 million people here , 10 million here .
if you can not secure the parents , you can not guarantee the security of the african child .
what are the risk factors ?
only less than one percent are adequately treated .
in eight short years , non-communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in africa .
this is a typical african hospital . we ca n't depend on the elites — they go to usa , germany , u.k. for treatment . unbelievable .
if they help , that 's good ! but that is not my expectation .
several years ago , we started thinking about it .
talk about sustainable investment , no one is interested .
we go for modular units . units that have multi-modality functions have modular components . easy to repair , and because of that , we do not take things that are not durable and can not last .
( applause ) we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .
we currently have three locations in the caribbean , and we 're planning a fourth one .
we encourage them to bring children .
so we are pleased with that .
so , we emphasize training . training is critical .
when have you been appointed to play god ?
i mean — he did n't know me .
but i listened for her check-ins every few minutes .
but it mattered to me that he survived .
i do n't smoke cigarillos anymore .
i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and i just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
who i was on my business card mattered to me .
to them , it did n't matter if i was rich or poor , the color of my skin , whether i was male or female , my sexual orientation , who i voted for , whether i was educated , if i had a faith or no faith at all .
how much do you get paid ?
do you know ?
most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary .
there 'd be arguments , there 'd be fights , there might even be a few people who quit .
but then , 1971 started aerovironment , with no employees — then one or two , three , and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects .
the company did not succeed , and he could n't pay the money back , and i was the guarantor of the note . so , i had a $ 100,000 debt , and i noticed that the kramer prize for human-powered flight , which had then been around for — ( laughter ) — 17 years at the time , was 50,000 pounds , which , at the exchange rate , was just about 100,000 dollars .
but that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how airplanes would , how hang gliders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the gossamer-condor-type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one did n't . and it was just , keep the weight down — 70 pounds was all it weighed — but let the size swell up , like a hang glider , but three times the span , three times the cord .
it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income tax .
but while this was going on , in 1982 , i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation — their annual prize — and i had to prepare a paper on it , which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there 'd be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of — all the change in it .
what 's the population of the earth ?
( music ) her designers ' attention to detail and her construction gives helios ' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere .
this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she 's sliding along on the ocean waves .
let 's have the next video . this shows the other end of the spectrum .
here , but — ( applause ) — anyway . ( applause )
now generally , it 's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all .
so here 's the example .
because for me , equations and symbols are n't just a thing .
we can actually build for you , very rapidly , a physical object .
they have been around for almost 30 years now , which is quite amazing to think of , but they 're only just starting to filter into the public arena .
and that data , layer by layer , gets passed through the machine , starting at the base of the product and depositing material , layer upon layer , infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process .
and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
in this case , we can see a laser sintering machine developed by eos .
and this is quite an extraordinary idea , but it is reality today .
and on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
and actually what 's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse .
so you can now create one-offs very easily .
and very hard to even create this by hand .
it 's very , very , very detailed inside with the design .
this technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and , i believe , cause a revolution in manufacturing .
you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily .
but this is not really mass customization ; it 's known as variant production , variations of the same product .
and also , you can engage in shape manipulation of that product , but within boundaries that are safe .
`` and when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design , they click `` '' enter '' '' and this data gets converted into the data that a 3d printer reads and gets passed to a 3d printer , perhaps on someone 's desktop . ''
we 're now , instead of shipping a product across the world , we 're sending data across the internet .
and applying this to the idea of building up what 's in our bodies .
it 's very intricate .
using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
we 're all different sizes and our companies the same .
( applause ) one , two , three , four .
now you 've got to picture aunt zip at 105 years old in sodom , north carolina .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
and he played his bluegrass style of music , but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from africa , along with the banjo .
it was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument .
you think money grows on trees . you 've never worked a day in your lives .
`` she went up to the foreman ; she said , `` i 've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . '' ''
of course , we were just eight and 10 .
`` do n't want it to leave me behind . '' '' and from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : `` '' good news , good news : chariot 's coming . ''
good news : chariot 's coming . good news : chariot 's coming .
`` and i do n't want it to leave me behind . '' '' ''
but if you have children , you know it does n't often work that way .
but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day , and that was an eye-opener .
do n't want it to leave me behind .
and i do n't want it to leave me behind . it was a few years ago , but i sort of remembered this story , and i told it at a concert . my mom was in the audience . after the — she was glad to have a story about herself , of course ,
it was made to play hawaiian music back in the 1920s , before they had electric guitars , trying to make a loud guitar .
and then african-american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck , just like that — a nice merlot works very well .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
now , you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes , but you know that 's not going to get you where you want to get .
open up now .
( laughter ) we were n't stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
that was pacific palisades ; it probably is still there , back there .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and — let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this .
i experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four .
as luck would have it , six months after we arrived , they too had a military coup .
there were no coups .
everything worked . great education .
six years later , i returned to the country .
everything was different .
the first is it made me fall in love with africa .
you see , all these countries i lived in , the coups d'état and the corruption i 'd seen in ghana and gambia and in zimbabwe , contrasted with the wonderful examples i had seen in botswana and in south africa of good leadership .
it 's because in africa , we have weak institutions , like the judiciary , the constitution , civil society and so forth .
`` i think i 'd like to stay in it forever . '' '' ( laughter ) well , you just can . ''
think warfare , corruption , human rights abuses .
i believe that the next generation to come after this , generation four , has a unique opportunity to transform the continent .
one billion people will need jobs in africa , so if we do n't grow our economies fast enough , we 're sitting on a ticking time bomb , not just for africa but for the entire world .
now , erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of madagascar , but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in madagascar .
now , what i like about this story is that it shows that opportunities to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere .
do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance , or that god gives them to us ?
( applause )
it came as a part of my participation in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a 79 percent reduction in violent crime over an eight-year period in a major city .
i wanted my own television ministry .
you 'd hear it almost every night , when you were cooking dinner , telling your child a bedtime story , or just watching tv .
i was doing funerals of 18-year-olds , 17-year-olds , and 16-year-olds , and i was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
i even tried to rap sermon one time .
this is why we have the police , right ?
`` as soon as the question , `` '' why me ? '' '' came , the answer came just as quickly : why me ? because i 'm the one who ca n't sleep at night thinking about it . ''
after about two weeks of volunteering at the high school , i realized that the youth that i was trying to reach , they were n't going to high school .
and then we did an amazing thing for preachers .
( laughter ) ( applause ) all right , come on , you 're cutting into my time now , okay ? ( laughter ) but it was amazing .
`` we said to them , `` '' we do n't know our own communities after 9 p.m. at night , between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. , but you do . ''
you are the subject matter experts , if you will , of that period of time .
so talk to us . teach us .
and one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless and uncharacteristically bold in their violence .
we know that 80 percent of life 's most defining moments take place by age 35 .
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking .
they just made it up .
now these companies have backed new laws like the animal enterprise terrorism act , which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits .
but right now , companies like transcanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists .
the fbi 's training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence , they 're about public relations .
the first of these ag-gag prosecutions , as they 're called , was a young woman named amy meyer , and amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street .
when i found out about her story , i wrote about it , and within 24 hours , it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges .
over and over throughout history , people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent .
it 's almost a symptom .
`` as a medical provider , i 'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other , so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says , `` '' i 'm going to die today , '' '' we are trained to reevaluate the patient 's condition . ''
that all changed with one incident .
he simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face .
`` as we talked , she had said to me , `` there was so much more i wanted to do with my life . '' ''
however , she perished prior to freeing her .
so books really are alive .
but at the same time , i 'm thinking about this idea of erasure , and what 's happening now that most of our information is intangible , and this idea of loss , and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers , but the information itself , now that we do n't have a physical backup , has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it .
and i have several dictionaries in my own studio , and i do use a computer every day , and if i need to look up a word , i 'll go on the computer , because i can go directly and instantly to what i 'm looking up .
it allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story , and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story , and that 's when we saw modernism emerge , and we saw painting go into different branches .
i was a college student in engineering .
but it was n't like that at all .
and then inserts these long , thin instruments and a camera , and actually does the procedure inside the patient .
a lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull .
( laughter ) if i had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me .
because what 's the difference ?
so , the more i did this research the more i thought there has to be a better way to do this .
i used this mechanism .
and the friction that 's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip .
right there .
it kept me up at night .
that first day in the operating room i never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar .
he was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions , and he was talking about what i could expect for the recovery , and what was going to happen .
they brought all sorts of different computers with them .
and these were all incompatible .
the frustration was all this unlocked potential .
it 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
`` but then — ok , when ted started , there was no web so things like `` '' click '' '' did n't have the same meaning . ''
alright , that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
who 's at the event ? whatever it is about that person , where they were born , things like that .
so , i can go ahead and look that thing up .
so he wrote a program to take the data , extract it from wikipedia , and put it into a blob of linked data on the web , which he called dbpedia .
think of the diversity of the web . it 's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
it 's actual useful . it 's got value .
we want unadulterated data .
and i 'm going to ask you to practice that , ok ?
audience : data .
here we are at ted , and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now — curing cancer , understanding the brain for alzheimer 's , understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable , understanding how the world works .
in fact , i 'll just go into one area — if you 're looking at alzheimer 's , for example , drug discovery — there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
now , they are sticking it onto — linked data — and now they can ask the sort of question , that you probably would n't ask , i would n't ask — they would .
but , that 's not true .
`` you just — you log on to your social networking site , your favorite one , you say , `` '' this is my friend . '' '' bing ! relationship . data . ''
we need to do that with linked data .
so , linked data — it 's huge .
you get this really huge power out of it .
i want you to demand it .
and they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank .
and days have turned into months , months into years .
`` and he said to her , `` '' i 'm sorry , my love , that i put you in this situation . ''
the sun was blazing during the day .
messages started coming in .
or that game the other day ? was that awesome ?
there 's no dynamic , there 's no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone .
louis daguerre invented photography in 1829 , and earlier today , when you whipped out your smartphone and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich , and you know who you are — ( laughter ) — was n't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with iodized silver ?
was woodstock awesome ? yes , it was awesome .
and finally , finally some of you ca n't wait to come up and tell me how awesome my powerpoint was .
i will save you the time .
my twin brother is a documentary filmmaker , and for one of his first films , he got an offer from a distribution company .
even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior .
power comes in lots of forms .
in negotiations , it comes in the form of alternatives .
we have a lot of leeway in how to behave .
and so it 's the low-power double bind .
she took his perspective , and she noticed something really important .
and it worked brilliantly .
well , one of the ways is be a mama bear .
another way we can earn strong allies , especially in high places , is by asking other people for advice .
and if we do , we 're not likable .
but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments , we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable .
and if you use those tools — and each and every one of you can use these tools — you will expand your range of acceptable behavior , and your days will be mostly joyful .
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains .
( whoosh ) this electric hush , as if they could sense what was about to happen .
( music ) and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach , cal state fullerton and riverside community college , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and — ( applause ) — and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
if we fix cities , actually it 's a big deal .
`` it 's called `` '' talk to me . '' '' well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us . ''
and i 'll show just a few examples — again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world — that 's a cellphone network — and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that 's collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
it 's when italy won the soccer world cup .
some of you might remember , it was italy and france playing , and then zidane at the end , the headbutt .
italy wins . yeah .
you saw the big peak .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer , how they came together .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
the whole building is made of water .
here 's the building working .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but then reality 's always unpredictable .
here is the video .
it 's something we 're working on for the london olympics .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today 's pressing challenges — think about climate change or co2 emissions — how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
( applause )
and that is what origami used to be .
it 's become an art form , a form of sculpture .
the first law is two-colorability . you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
the directions of the folds at any vertex — the number of mountain folds , the number of valley folds — always differs by two . two more or two less .
`` and you 'd think , `` '' can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? '' '' but indeed , the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin , and yet they govern all of chemistry , all of life , all of history . ''
what 's the most abstract form ? it 's a stick figure .
if i make the flap as skinny as possible , i get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed .
there 's other ways of making flaps .
it 's an artist 's rendition , but it flew in a japanese telescope in 1995 .
now , there is actually a little origami in the james webb space telescope , but it 's very simple .
they called it the eyeglass .
folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures .
and they adopted that for their first generation , which was not 100 meters — it was a five-meter .
seven years ago , a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company .
`` that 's literally all it is . '' '' so i obviously declined to invest . ''
why was i so wrong ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) since then , i have traded hair for teeth . ( laughter )
she has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate .
there 's a sweet spot where originals seem to live .
we asked people to generate new business ideas , and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are .
take leonardo da vinci .
what about martin luther king , jr. ?
the night before the biggest speech of his life , the march on washington , he was up past 3am , rewriting it .
what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish .
if you wanted firefox or chrome , you had to doubt the default and ask , is there a different option out there , and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser .
in every past version , the main character has been an evil queen .
the things we wish we could redo , if you look at the science , are the chances not taken .
do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults , too ?
why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times ?
so if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
so we 're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces , make eye contact with you , make a full range of facial expressions , understand speech and begin to model how you 're feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you .
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
so , if they achieve human level intelligence or , quite possibly , greater than human levels of intelligence , this could be the seeds of hope for our future .
we specked it out to actually be doable with a very , very low-cost bill of materials , so that it can become a childhood companion for kids .
interfacing with the internet , it gets smarter over the years .
chris anderson : thank you so much . that 's incredible .
( applause )
i am a reformed marketer , and i now work in international development .
in the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east .
and due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
and so while i was in the drc , i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including damien .
they like the generics .
their marketing is slightly different .
( applause )
( laughter ) and we 're trying to figure that out , because it is an amazing capability .
( laughter ) this is not about overwhelming force , but proportional force .
`` it 's your oil , not ours . '' '' which is the truth . it 's their oil . ''
we do n't have anything to translate that will into action .
`` what we do have is the u.s.-enabled leviathan force that says , `` '' you want me to take that guy down ? i 'll take that guy down . ''
all security dominated .
they 've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the cold war .
( laughter ) so we were home alone for eight years .
it 's not our system of governance .
that 's the scary part .
it 's going to be the department of agriculture for the 21st century .
this is the military the rest of the world wants us to build .
it 's why i travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries .
you need the experience .
the rule is going to be this .
absolutely not .
i want them to be marines .
you 'll see the pattern — airborne , just like carriers .
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .
and i founded my country 's first graphic design and new media college .
`` here 's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme `` '' education is a right . '' '' some logos designed by my students . ''
this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world .
shü-mom is a writing system .
that is , until 1998 , when one yale professor john coleman darnell discovered these inscriptions in the thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western egypt , and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 b.c. , centuries before mesopotamia .
it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
i 've had some time to think it over .
but they are not applicable in all situations .
so , it 's logical that you 'd have one there , on the minor road entering the major .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
( applause )
since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
there are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex — like defusing a bomb .
thank you .
i first actually got into this topic when i heard about the ebola outbreak last year .
so with h1n1 , there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to 17 other people .
and then i tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin , throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation .
so it 's very cost-effective to install and we can do this directly overnight .
instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns , we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones .
so you 'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again , but this time , we 're able to effectively push that down to the filters for elimination .
so you 'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all .
in the past , the sars epidemic actually cost the world about 40 billion dollars .
and in the future , a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars .
so before , it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months , spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something .
so what i 'm really interested in is creative problem solving .
`` why were you there ? who pays for your trips ? '' '' — all these little details . ''
`` northwest flight seven coming into seattle on march 12th '' '' or whatever . ''
a couple weeks later , i 'd call again , let them know .
`` just wanted to say , `` '' hey guys . ''
basically , what i decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that 's cool .
see that ? they wo n't let me on a plane with that , but they 'll give it to me on the plane .
this is in warsaw .
and when you 're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence , you 're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner .
and after piecing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .
and i bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville .
so there 's points , and these points are actually being cross-referenced .
sometimes you just get this , just an empty hallway in salt lake city , january 22nd .
this , by the way , is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in california — vietnamese sandwich .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
now it 's all done on my iphone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
and really , it 's not the most user-friendly interface .
and we 're getting to that .
so in a way , i 'm glad that i 'm completely obsolete .
i 'm watching who 's watching me .
and i came up with these .
so these are some of my sample logs .
and just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there .
you can see the national security agency likes to come by .
central intelligence agency .
not really sure why they show up , but they do .
and i 'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .
so it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it 's done .
bg : on the day you are in a place where there is no coverage , the fbi gets crazy ?
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
but there 's actually a large aspect of technology that 's much more predictable , and that 's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings , they have urgencies , they have tendencies .
i call it cognifying — cognification — also known as artificial intelligence , or ai .
but it 's more than that .
it starts with maybe a simple low iq in a rat or mouse , and maybe there 's more in a chimpanzee , and then maybe there 's more in a stupid person , and then maybe an average person like myself , and then maybe a genius .
but in other cases they may be lower .
so we 're going to take these things , these artificial clusters , and we 'll be adding more varieties of artificial cognition to our ais .
that 's the whole feature of it .
( laughter ) just driving , ok ?
we may need a two-step program , which is to invent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems , say , like dark energy or quantum gravity .
the second aspect of this is that we are going to use ai to basically make a second industrial revolution .
and you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times , and that formula was what brought us the industrial revolution .
it 's like a new commodity ; it 's a new utility .
that 's available right now .
and robots are going to be bots , they 're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done .
( laughter ) we 're really good at things that are inefficient .
it runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that do n't work , otherwise you 're not learning . it runs on the fact
we 're in the first hour of what 's coming .
that means that you 're not late .
i would watch nova on pbs .
our school would show bill nye the science guy .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
now , this is n't new . anyone who 's used google earth has seen this before , but one thing we like to say in our group is , we do the opposite of google earth .
and i mention this because there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead , that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there 's no more spacecraft out there .
granted , we do n't have everything in between , because some of the data is hard to get .
we 're now riding along with voyager 1 .
it looks like i 've paused the program .
with a 3d visualization like this , we can not only just say voyager 1 flew by saturn .
thank you . ( applause )
when i saw a piece of technology called kinect — it was called natal — i was inspired , and i thought for a moment , maybe it 's possible to address that one problem of storytelling , to create a character which seemed alive , which noticed me , that could look me in the eyes and feel real , and sculpt a story about our relationship .
now , i 'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick , but it 's a trick that actually works .
that means no two people 's milos can be the same .
why not just , instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad , why not use your body just to lean on the chair — again , relaxed ?
he 's now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that 's his voice .
and we 'll do that in a second .
they 're fine with teaching milo for the first few throws , but then they want to beat milo , where women , they 're more nurturing about this .
pm : so , milo 's being called back in by his parents , giving us time to be alone and to help him out .
we 've all done it as parents ; we 've all done it as children .
he 's just moved house . he 's got no friends .
now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to milo .
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
and their love [ for studying ] was so big that i cried .
even nuclear seems to be making a comeback .
but when you look at the percentage of global electricity from clean energy sources , it 's actually been in decline from 36 percent to 31 percent .
well , it turns out to be quite a bit .
there 's just a lot of poor countries that are still using wood and dung and charcoal as their main source of energy , and they need modern fuels .
they 're doing a lot of clean energy .
sometimes you have to go places to really get the right data , so we traveled to india a few months ago .
`` but last year we did just five , and the year before that , we did five . '' '' so , let 's just take a closer look at nuclear . ''
and i , myself , have been very excited about it .
we were there with mit and uc berkeley engineers .
because we 're in a little bit of a climate crisis right now .
`` that will save money and time . '' '' and the engineer just looked at me and said , `` '' let me ask you a question : would you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before ? '' '' so what about the other reactors ? ''
but it 's really big and bulky , that 's part of the safety , and nobody thinks it 's going to ever get cheaper than the reactors that we have .
but when we got there and interviewed people and even looked at the internal documents , they 're now saying they 're going to do about five .
we 're actually talking about taking reactors down before their lifetimes are over .
germany 's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that .
i mentioned the united states — we could lose half of our reactors over the next 15 years , which would wipe out 40 percent of the emissions reductions we 're supposed to get under the clean power plan .
what we found is that the world is actually at risk of losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years .
in other words : we 're not in a clean energy revolution ; we 're in a clean energy crisis .
everybody 's scared of the accidents .
it 's caused by our fears .
there 's not very much of it .
that means there 's always going to be people that think it 's a big problem for reasons that maybe do n't have as much to do with the actual waste as we think .
well , what about the weapons ?
for years , i 'd seen photos of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith , much like the stereotypical image painted of the american muslim experience .
frustrated by this myopic view , my friend and i had this crazy idea : let 's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of ramadan and share those stories on a blog .
but i believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts i 've ever received .
and then i had to quickly learn international policy , because i was asked to work on the un convention that protects people with disabilities .
and that tool is called design thinking .
the second is observing people in real-life situations and empathizing with them .
and finally , implementation : ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable .
this looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world .
but what i quickly realized was that i was missing out on something .
well , this is because i experience conversations as rhythms .
similarly , design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often , because eventually , you will succeed .
my observation skills have been honed so that i pick up on things that others would never pick up on .
design thinkers often seek out extreme situations , because that often informs some of their best designs .
and haiti — it was like a perfect storm .
but they came with pre-determined solutions .
`` and they were competitive about this : `` you pommies , your rates of heart disease are shocking . '' ''
but it 's not just australia that has better health than britain .
and it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
it 's not the heart . what do you do ?
`` it 's a species close to human , with several advantages over mice : they 're free , you do n't shave them , they feed themselves , and nobody pickets your office saying , `` save the lab medical student . '' ''
but what we found was that we could n't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice .
could the sun activate those stores into the circulation , and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system ?
now , we 're still collecting data .
but this is a separate mechanism from vitamin d .
and what we 've shown is that doing a sham irradiation — this is the thick line here — this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays do n't hit the skin .
`` and restructured the whole thing , including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place `` '' the battle of anghiari '' '' on a specific area of one of the two walls . ''
that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about 60 years later , well , those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo .
well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . look at these portraits .
they 're magnificent . you see leonardo at work .
we can , as we said , we can zoom in . then we can scroll .
okay ? let 's go and find the elephant .
so all we need is one finger . just wipe off and we see the elephant . ( applause ) ( applause ) okay ? and then if we want , we can continue the scroll to find out , for example , on the staircase , the whole iconography is going to be changed . there are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple , and there are a lot of figures showing up . see ?
well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .
we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values , these cultural values that we badly need , especially today .
as long as we live a life of curiosity and passion , there is a bit of leonardo in all of us . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
what i 'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter , and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea .
and in particular , i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .
and when evolutionary biologists talk about design , they really mean design by natural selection .
and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this .
you actually see a great potential , but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf , and may actually be very resistant , when one tries to introduce ideas .
and i 'm going to be talking , to begin with , as i said , about diarrheal disease organisms .
so , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens , even hundreds of other individuals .
the whole point is that a person who ca n't move can still infect many other individuals .
so , one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria , and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water , tend to be more harmful .
and the answer is — yep , they are .
i mean , if this would require thousands of years , then it 's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens .
if the organism produced a lot of toxin , you might find 10 million , or 100 million .
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission , thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact , or person-food-person contact — both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .
other countries , in which you 've got a lot of waterborne transmission , there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness , right ?
there 's a little ethical problem in this experiment .
she got rehydration therapy , she perked up , within a few days she was looking like a completely different person .
but interestingly , just that thing happened in 1991 .
each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person — a lot of variation on which natural selection can act .
they did n't — they solved the problem in chile .
but , before we get too confident , we 'd better look at some of those other countries , and make sure that this organism does n't just always evolve toward mildness .
well , in peru it did n't .
it would n't be causing severe disease .
if we look in the beginning of the 1990s , we see , again , a lot of variation .
well , they decided to mosquito proof every house in northern alabama .
every row across here represents one of those 11 zones .
and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete .
because when we 're dealing with infectious diseases , we 're dealing with living systems .
we 're dealing with living systems ; we 're dealing with systems that evolve .
it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners , and so on .
so the other thing i really like about this , besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease , is that often the kinds of interventions that you want , that it indicates should be done , are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow .
if we know that we 're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water , then i think that we can say , let 's push the effort into that aspect of the control , so that we can actually solve the problem , even though , if you just look at the frequency of infection , you would suggest that you ca n't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply .
they have to find a cure , and if they can not find a cure , he will die .
we 're not doing so well here .
so as miraculous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it 's not that great .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it , hiv .
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the '40s and '50s , '60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address — as we 've seen in the case of hiv .
`` so during the last 15 years , i 've been working to actually study the earlier interface here — what i 've labeled `` '' viral chatter , '' '' which was a term coined by my mentor don burke . ''
this is a picture of a central african hunter .
it 's actually a fairly common picture .
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood — that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .
so if we 're going to study viral chatter , we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals .
we look at the diseases , which are in the animals as well as the humans .
nathan wolfe : this species , yeah . and there 's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals .
but in fact that 's not the only question they 're going to ask you about this .
when i arrived i did n't speak a word of french , and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he 's about to solve this problem .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
so from that day on , i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
these were the ones i 'd like to draw — all variations of four legs and fur .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that 's what a dinosaur looks like .
but it 's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes .
for instance , take these sea turtles .
they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .
( laughter ) he ca n't spin a web anytime ; he 's got to pull his pants down first . ( laughter )
and then i 'm going to attempt onscreen animation here .
he 's a great white shark .
and then i 'll introduce you to one more character , this guy , ernest , who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body .
this next one here , i did a story on the census of marine life .
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
i did another story on marine debris .
`` i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business , and they — i asked them , `` '' so what 's one issue you would like everyone to know more about ? '' '' and they said — this one friend of mine said , `` i 've got one word for you : plastic . '' ''
what i 'm trying to tell readers is that plastic does n't really go away ; it just continues to wash downstream .
and so i killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for 15 years .
you really do n't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins , so i kind of exposed that .
imagine you 're in an enormous room , and it 's as dark as a cave .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you ca n't see anything .
it 's big , it 's heavy . you ca n't carry it away , so you bang it with your hammer , and you break off a piece .
and you 're getting all kinds of cool stuff .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
`` and part of what mission blue is about is yelling , `` '' stop ! '' '' so that each of us — explorer , scientist , cartoonist , singer , chef — can turn up the lights in their own way . ''
he 's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics .
it was actually retracted from the journal lancet , in which it was published , and that author , a physician , had his medical license taken away from him .
furthermore , one of the ingredients in vaccines , something called thimerosal , was thought to be what the cause of autism was .
based on epidemiological data , we know that one of the causes , or one of the associations , i should say , is advanced paternal age , that is , increasing age of the father at the time of conception .
in particular , there 's a medication , valproic acid , which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take , we know can increase that risk of autism .
on the other hand , there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings , suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone .
so the question becomes , how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are .
so in fact , at the simons foundation , we took 2,600 individuals that had no family history of autism , and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases ?
this baby we know is going to be in the clear .
and so in fact , identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets , to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that 's really what we need to do in autism .
i want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
and i stood there beside two very good friends of mine , richard weber and kevin vallely .
it 's going to be 40 below , every single day .
a couple of buddies of mine and i had finished a 111-day run across the entire sahara desert .
and while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in northern africa .
crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
i 'm telling you , crossing these things with 170-pound sled , that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds , because that 's what it felt like .
we were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well , about 10-hour trekking days , 15-hour trekking days , sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal .
in turn , students , people from around the world , would ask us questions .
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
and do you get along ? i certainly hope so , because at some point or another on this expedition , one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle , and put it in an infected blister , and drain it for you .
the first thing i want to do is say thank you to all of you .
so everywhere we look , pretty much across the board , we worry that the people we depend on do n't really have our interests at heart .
instead , all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime .
so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos , and they need to measure out round columns .
dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass .
wise people know when and how to bend the rules .
the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
if you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself , what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people .
together they comprise practical wisdom , which aristotle thought was the master virtue .
he was supporting his wife and a child , and the child was going to parochial school .
all this would do is wreck a family .
and it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life — a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge .
so here was the consultant 's advice : first , do n't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do .
you need to have incentives .
first , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
if you reward teachers for kids ' test scores , they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation .
so canny outlaws are better than nothing , but it 's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time .
he was in a court called the veterans ' court .
and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging .
and what the veterans ' court did , was it treated each criminal as an individual , tried to get inside their problems , tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves , and did n't forget about them once the judgment was made .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
there are now 22 cities that have veterans ' courts like this .
so here 's is a system-changer , and it seems to be catching .
and in order to be an effective doctor , you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease .
indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
thanks .
if you 're sentenced to a jail term in santa barbara , california , you should know that if you do n't like the standard accommodations , you can buy a prison cell upgrade .
over the past three decades , we have lived through a quiet revolution .
the difference is this : a market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organizing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale .
if the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws , then inequality would n't matter very much .
but when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life — decent health care , access to the best education , political voice and influence in campaigns — when money comes to govern all of those things , inequality matters a great deal .
they 've tried this , actually .
in dallas , texas , they have a program that offers eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read .
who will get our discussion started ? yes ?
then they stop reading ?
elizabeth loftus : i 'm elizabeth loftus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?
here 's why .
and so , in the end , the question of markets is not mainly an economic question .
there 's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use dna to self-assemble those functional structures .
and so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale .
and this is demonstrating that through random energy , we can build non-random shapes .
last year at ted long beach , we built an installation that builds installations .
so today for the first time , we 're unveiling a new project , which is a collaboration with stratasys , and it 's called 4d printing .
these are parts being printed with multi-material properties .
and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves .
let 's go back to infrastructure .
so i want to remind you today of the harsh realities of assembly in our world .
so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you 're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world , how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale , so that we can go from a world like this to a world that 's more like this .
we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives .
and that shirt that i had n't worn in years ?
we want space efficiency .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
thank you .
and that day i knew that when i grew up , i was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
instead , our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that could n't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
the biophony is all of the sound that 's generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place .
and i want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe .
and here 's lincoln meadow before selective logging .
this is after selective logging .
the static-like sounds that are very low , that you 're going to hear right now .
a colleague of mine was recording in the american midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
( beaver crying ) yeah . well .
the maldives , as i 'm sure you 're aware , are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of india here .
i need to explain a little bit about monsoons .
`` now , monsoon , the root of the word `` '' monsoon '' '' comes from the word `` '' season . '' '' so , it 's just a season . and there are two seasons in most of south asia . ''
and in the summer india heats up , gets very hot .
that 's what brings the monsoon rain .
now , i 'm a marine biologist , but i 'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist , i suppose .
but this guy is an exception .
and this is called the globe skimmer , or wandering glider .
and , as the name might suggest , it is found pretty much around the world .
did n't notice them .
but after some time , after some months , one day as i was going out and about , suddenly i noticed hundreds of dragonflies , hundreds of dragonflies .
and they were there for some time . and then they were gone .
and i asked people about them and yes , they knew , but they did n't know anything , where they came from , or anything .
and the maldives , and i 'm sure some of you have been there — so here is home .
so , maldives , beautiful place .
but in maldives , no fresh water . so , what on earth is going on ?
and there is the answer , 21st of october .
not every year , that 's the average date .
you 'd think they 're coming from india . it 's the closest place .
maldives is a long archipelago .
how on earth are they doing that ?
i wanted to know about their seasonality , what time of year , this is when they first arrive , but how long are they around for ? does that give any clues ?
what happens , actually , is there is two air masses .
so , if you 've got india here , when the front is up above india you 're into the southwest monsoon .
so , as it comes over towards malé i 'm standing in malé underneath the front .
i know because we have reports from seychelles , which fit in as well , down here .
and they are breeding in the rains of africa .
the wind will swoosh them out across here .
they 'll hatch out in six weeks . by that time the seasonal rains have moved on . it 's not there , it 's down here .
there 's a convergence . so , wherever the rain is falling , the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that 's rising .
a quite incredible feat .
there is more to the story .
but it 's also called the amur falcon .
and if you 're a falcon it 's quite a nice place to be in the summer .
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern india .
and these birds , what i 've done is i 've complied all the records , all the available records of these birds , put them together , and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies .
flying at night over the indian ocean 2,424 meters .
and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from india to east africa eats insects , large insects , the size of dragonflies . thank you very much .
i 'm a psychologist , but rest assured , i will not bring it to the scrotal .
as they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning , clearly in need . the question is : did they stop to help ?
( laughter ) now this is a — it 's a little test i encourage you to try out at a party .
for one thing , he 's almost seven feet tall .
in a sense , the room itself is the elephant in the room , but we do n't see it . and we 've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere . consider this .
and it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt .
there 's a company , bennett and company , that supplies polo.com , victoria 's secret — they , because of their ceo , who 's aware of this , in china formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater .
and we found out that he was hispanic , he did n't speak any english , he had no money , he 'd been wandering the streets for days , starving , and he 'd fainted from hunger .
immediately someone went to get orange juice , someone brought a hotdog , someone brought a subway cop .
it 's about a tenth of a millimeter .
that 's how small that is .
so this whole world , the nano world , this area in here is called the nano world , and the nano world , the whole micro world that we see , there 's a nano world that is wrapped up within that , and the whole — and that is the world of molecules and atoms .
the petal of that flower looks like that , so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects , and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here , this is the style of that flower , and you notice that it 's got these little — these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs . these are nectar spurs .
but when you look closer at this , look at what 's there .
so mountains are built up , and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth , and they become grains of sand .
there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels , and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean , and it 's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
now something 's interesting here . this looks very different than any sand on earth that i 've ever seen , and i 've seen a lot of sand on earth , believe me . ( laughter ) look at this hole in the middle . that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon .
again , income inequality is not a good thing .
and guess what ?
history always does it .
thank you .
my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater — at least i thought it was beautiful .
( laughter ) and i was so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater .
and i 'm thinking , no , this is not possible .
but so , curious , i run up to the child — of course scaring the living bejesus out of him — grab him by the collar , turn it over , and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater .
i had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers .
but at the same time , i started a micro-finance bank , and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen , which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks , which now is a worldwide movement — you talk about a meme — but then it was quite new , especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade .
what we did n't understand , what was happening all around us , with the confluence of fear , ethnic strife and certainly an aid game , if you will , that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside rwanda , that at that time , 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid .
they now make four dollars a day , which is pretty much middle class for india , and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
it 's estimated that africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease .
today , three years later , the company has employed another thousand women .
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture .
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision , its playfulness , its innovation and its promise of imminent violence .
it is also not a monument to design , it is a monument to design 's utility .
( applause ) okay , what is this object ?
it looks terrible . is it a little hot plate ?
and yet i forget about it all the time .
most people do pick the paper .
it 's biodegradable . it 's reusable .
in some cases , it 's recyclable .
so what happens is , we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions .
and environmental folklore is a really important thing because we 're trying to do the right thing .
but how do we know if we 're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment ?
and you see , the choices that we make as an individual , but the choices that we make in every single job that we have , no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order , has an impact on all of these systems .
its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , but this is a net situation .
we need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems .
and as i was just explaining , food waste is a problem .
but essentially , this is a big problem .
we 've had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
so we need to design things like this far better if we 're going to start addressing serious environmental problems .
this is design-led system change , design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable .
`` how do i make the materials green in the manufacturing ? '' '' would you ask me those questions ? ''
so imagine if you designed kettles , you actually found a way to solve these system failures , because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system , just because the product has n't thought about the problem that it 's going to have when it exists in the world .
and this is what i call behavior-changing products : products , systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front .
now , this is a technology arena , so obviously these things are quite popular , but i think if we 're going to keep designing , buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do , which is astronomically high , there are seven billion people who live in the world right now .
these are communities , and this is happening all over the world .
`` i said , `` '' how come you 're not doing sustainability ? i know you know this . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , recently i pitched a sustainability project to a client , and turned and he said to me , 'i know it 's going to cost less , i know it 's going to sell more , but we 're not pioneers , because pioneers have arrows in their backs . ' '' '' i think we 've got a roomful of pioneers , and i hope there are far more pioneers out there , because we need to solve these problems . ''
can we stand to have more relationships ?
teaching and learning should bring joy .
its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails , or worse , turns against its own people , people have somewhere to go , to live in safety and dignity until they can go home .
but not from a top-down institutional perspective , rather from the perspective of a refugee .
in the camp , she might get assistance , but there are very few prospects for amira and her family .
education is often of poor quality .
and so when amira and her family have used up their basic savings , they 're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution .
for refugees , that choice is the global refugee regime today .
we chose uganda not because it 's representative of all host countries .
they 're completely unnecessary journeys , and last year , they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on europe 's borders and within european territory .
man 8 : okay , a12 , right there !
you 're standing around there and you 're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass .
so when we developed glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
and also we wanted to free up the ears , so the sound actually goes through , conducts straight to the bones in your cranium , which is a little bit freaky at first , but you get used to it .
i just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment .
and lastly i 've realized , in experimenting with this device , that i also kind of have a nervous tic .
so , i 'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .
it is able to move around its environment .
so here we are . these are protocells , patterning their environment .
and then they are fossilized over millions of years .
now a block of limestone , in itself , is n't particularly that interesting .
but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere .
so , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .
now , this is n't going to happen tomorrow . it 's going to take a while .
secondly , these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems , which means they can perform in similar ways .
they think i 'm a bit crazy , but that 's another story .
it was about a boyfriend . the girl on the top , she 'd kissed the wrong boy , and they 'd started having a fight .
i wanted to put them on a pedestal like they 'd never been seen before .
`` the whole world came running , and it was a bizarre experience , because everybody , from everywhere : `` '' who are they ? what are they ? how many are they ? ''
it 's all made out of his human hair .
perhaps i have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where i actually fit .
you may not be reflected in his eyes , but there is something extraordinarily important about these people .
and my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i 'm attempting to elaborate upon here .
at the age of 17 , i was recruiting people from cambridge university to this organization .
they would have felt isolated , until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon .
well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .
and that 's the power of social movements .
which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists .
and i believe that 's for four reasons .
to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .
what i mean by that is , if the world superpower today was a communist , it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism , than it is today with the world superpower being america , occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals .
is it just about grievances ?
mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising .
but to get to that stage , where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric , but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship — i.e . you 're voting in a democracy , in an existing democracy , and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box .
to get to that stage , we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground .
but generally , the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region , the middle east and north africa region .
and the aspiration that we have at the moment — as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism — is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that .
if you take public transit , it 's about two hours .
the american way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many , many american cities , and as a result , they have seen a decline of relations , of the things that make us happy .
leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio , and he created a recycling project in the slum .
at the end of last year , december 16 , he received an eviction order by the rio de janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years .
leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low-income communities in rio , and jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created .
obrigado . thank you .
i 've been in afghanistan for 21 years .
today , i would like to tell you a story , the story of a big change , and the story of the people who made this change possible .
but as soon as the fighting intensified , the physical rehabilitation was suspended .
it 's something that comes out from the past .
it 's 21 years , but they are still all there .
the man was without legs and only with one arm .
`` so i said , `` '' well i will give him some money . '' '' and so the following day , i went to the orthopedic center . ''
`` give him some money . '' '' but mahmoud and his son were already there . ''
`` it 's not a priority . '' '' but najmuddin told me , `` '' listen now , we 're here . '' '' at least we can start repairing the prostheses , the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like mahmoud . '' '' i said , `` '' no , please . we can not do that . ''
it 's really dangerous .
but finally , the great day arrived .
mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs .
we could not possibly stay indoors , with all these sandbags at the windows .
and we ran .
and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .
dignity can not wait for better times .
it was the easiest way .
and it 's even cruel to think of anything like this .
we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .
`` it became a policy of `` '' positive discrimination , '' '' we call it now . ''
everybody benefits from that — those employed , of course , because they get a job and dignity .
i have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be implemented in other countries .
it is possible and it is not difficult .
and you should see me during the match .
and the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray .
so i hope that you do n't wait for school lunch hero day to say thank you to your lunch staff , and i hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be .
thank you .
when i found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
`` i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . '' '' ( laughter ) i swear . ''
the act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
they all matter .
mark bezos : thank you .
they are very important to how we communicate with each other .
by the end of the talk , we 're going to see it move .
and we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face , and different principle directions of light from the light stage , to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face .
but they basically created a digital puppet of her , where you can pull on these various strings , and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took .
`` and , in addition to the coarse-scale geometry , they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called `` '' displacement maps '' '' that animate as well . ''
image metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
you can see all the wrinkles happening there .
this is bruce lawmen , one of our researchers in the group , who graciously agreed to get captured running in the light stage .
and thank you very much .
i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child .
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
but more and more frequently these days i 'm seeing terrible things underwater as well , things that i do n't think most people realize .
this is a photo that i made showing one of these pups that 's only about five or seven days old — still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly — that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase .
this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
and because i love sharks — i 'm somewhat obsessed with sharks — i wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
one of the locations was this place called tiger beach , in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .
you know , we know almost nothing about them .
you know , we 're losing them faster than we can possibly find them .
but , you know , here we see a shark that 's maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water .
but that 's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore .
i actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman 's permission , i cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida .
and these are animals that had never seen humans before , and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .
you know , i read that the pilgrims , when they landed at plymouth rock in massachusetts in 1620 , wrote that you could walk across cape cod bay on the backs of right whales .
and we ca n't go back and see that today , but maybe we can preserve what we have left .
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story .
so when the fish control the urchin population , the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium .
i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea , and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it , and i do n't think it 's too late .
the second , or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world , you have pockets , like slums , or shantytowns , or poorer areas , which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city , so it 's us and them .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments — you 've been listening to all that in the morning — it 's always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine , should be .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
there are such areas , but — anyway , i 'd never heard that anywhere else .
the first one was done in new delhi in 1999 .
so we thought that this is what was happening : that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet . but under what circumstances ?
so , it has to be the other way about .
`` and as soon as they saw me they said , `` we need a faster processor and a better mouse . '' ''
so , madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier ; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to .
this is the desert to the west . near the pakistan border .
so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power , so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running .
so if they have access to the computer , they will teach themselves , including intelligence .
i could n't find a single correlation with anything , but it had to be in groups .
and that may be of great , you know , interest to this group , because all of you are talking about groups .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you lift the adult intervention .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
`` a typical example being , `` '' sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . '' '' they do n't have a way to determine which way to answer this question ; perhaps none of us do . ''
so here are my four sentences then .
powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology , but it was not meant for education , it was meant for making boardroom presentations .
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
a time for even grimmer stuff than that , like in last april 's new yorker magazine .
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
i say this guy — alberto giacometti , shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss 100 franc note .
it works a little something like — this is a recent google search for four in the morning .
results vary , of course . this is pretty typical .
where was wislawa szymborska during all this ?
( laughter ) coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .
( laughter ) video : homer simpson : we have a tennis court , a swimming pool , a screening room — you mean if i want pork chops , even in the middle of the night , your guy will fry them up ?
would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
what happened to william jefferson clinton ?
now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . what 's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . that 's pitiful , and it 's preventable .
thank you .
my self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry , and it still always tastes funny in my mouth .
and you , you get to share mine .
so in one level it went from something like 13 dollars to 266 , literally in the space of four months , and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours .
`` `` sub-prime pedaling . '' `` barclays takes you for a ride . '' ''
so what 's starting to happen , if you think about money , if you sort of boil money down to an essence , it is literally just an expression of value , an agreed value .
it seems farfetched , but when you think about it , in america in 1860 , there were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes .
so i think , you know , will we be standing on stage buying a coffee — organic , fair trade coffee — next year using ted florins or ted shillings ?
thank you very much .
( laughter ) and what this data represents for our family at a personal level , the impact has already been immense , and we 're still learning its value .
my son is leaving red ink . i am leaving green ink .
and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
and just for contrast , we can do this with any word .
`` and we look , and we find , as you would expect , a contrast in the landscape where the word `` '' bye '' '' occurs much more in a structured way . ''
this has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space .
philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you 're seeing .
and you do n't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people 's conversations , you just tune into publicly available social media feeds .
and the same idea now can be built up .
and what we 're seeing here , these skyscrapers now , are commentary that are linked to content on television .
same concept , but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere .
and so fundamentally , rather than , for example , measuring content based on how many people are watching , this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content .
and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family , we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people .
they talk to other people .
so a lot of people are following this person — very influential — and they have a propensity to talk about what 's on tv .
and i think the implications here are profound , whether it 's for science , for commerce , for government , or perhaps most of all , for us as individuals .
`` and then i went on to reflect , `` '' is n't it amazing , this entire database , all these recordings , i 'm going to hand off to you and to your sister '' '' — who arrived two years later — `` '' and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? '' '' and he was quiet for a moment . ''
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once — captured on film .
can you do it ?
the second is an aim : we should have more trust .
i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
but , of course , i can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined .
`` and you might say , when you understood the answer to that , `` well , i trust some of them , but not others . '' ''
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust .
let me give you a simple commercial example .
i 'd like to have you look at this pencil .
they are the slaves .
and they 're the masters .
indeed , a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons .
but alas , that hole has closed up .
it was not going to work , so i decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had , at least some of them , had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons .
they approached the most powerful judge , lord mansfield , who was chief judge of the court of king 's bench , and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of james somerset .
now , courts and legislatures draw lines all the time .
and so we chose chimpanzees , and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition .
they can anticipate tomorrow , which is why it 's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee , especially alone .
they have some kind of moral capacity .
they can do some simple math .
tommy was a chimpanzee . we found him in that cage .
now , all these cases are still going on .
i was n't quite sure what i was looking at .
the last time i 'd painted , i was 16 years old at summer camp , and i did n't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface , because that 's not what this project was about for me .
i was having so much fun with this process .
and that 's architecture .
and look at these solid , stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements .
this is a nice building .
it 's about a new kind of public amenity for the city , a place to gather and read and share .
we wear all black , we get very depressed , you think we 're adorable , we 're dead inside because we 've got no choice .
we have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love .
so as we get closer to the '80s , we start to reengage those symbols .
they 're easy , they 're cheap , because instead of making places , we 're making memories of places .
ordinarily , the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction .
paul goldberger said that bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics , academics , and the general public were completely united around a building .
and it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism .
it 's never going to happen again , i think , because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete , of steel , or of the elevator , and it 's a media revolution .
now we can make nearly instantaneous , emotionally charged symbols out of something that 's brand new .
that 's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of livingston , to the people of livingston , and say , there 's no one answer to what a library is today .
architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings , and you are n't the hapless public , the consumer that wo n't accept anything that they have n't seen anymore .
and i 'm going to share my music with you , but i hope that i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story , tells a story about how i used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention , and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that i was asking in my discipline , and how boredom also , in a sense , pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional , narrow definition of a composer .
in fact , that was a piece by beethoven , and so i was not functioning as a composer .
just now i was functioning in the role of the interpreter , and there i am , interpreter .
anyway , but i guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity , but as i 've presented them to you today , they 're actually solitary enterprises , and so pretty soon i want to commune with other people , and so i 'm delighted that in fact i get to compose works for them .
the full score is 72 feet wide .
and undefined pictographic glyphs . ( laughter ) now this was a really exciting experience for me .
they follow the second hands , and as they pass over the various symbols , the players respond musically .
so in these two capacities , i 've been scavenger , in the sense of taking , like , the subway map , right , or thief maybe , and i 've also been designer , in the case of making the wristwatches .
`` this is `` '' tlön , '' '' for three conductors and no players . ( laughter ) this was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language , which produced no decibels to speak of , but affectively , psychologically , was a very loud experience . ''
and secondly , i feel it 's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people , these amazing talks that we 've had .
( applause ) i 've been studying chimpanzees in tanzania since 1960 .
moreover , we know that in different parts of africa , wherever chimps have been studied , there are completely different tool-using behaviors .
what we find is that over these 40-odd years that i and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as i say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there is n't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom .
we find that they show emotions , similar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
they 're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we did n't have about 50 years ago ?
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
`` everything is hopeless — we 're always being told so by the media . '' '' and then i met some who were angry , and anger that can turn to violence , and we 're all familiar with that . ''
shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls .
every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you ca n't actually — even if you stay in bed all day , you 're breathing oxygen and giving out co2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that — you 're making a difference in the world .
one for animals , including domestic animals — and i have to say , i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got to gombe and the chimps from my dog , rusty , who was my childhood companion .
it 's going to depend on which country they 're in — and we 're already in 60-plus countries , with about 5,000 active groups — and there are groups all over the place that i keep hearing about that i 've never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves .
because they 're buying into it , and they 're the ones who get to decide what they 're going to do .
how many more minutes ? two , one ?
it 's what i 'm devoting most of my energy to .
`` but the kids do ask me — and this wo n't take more than two minutes , i promise — the kids say , `` '' dr. jane , do you really have hope for the future ? ''
we can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help .
it 's really up to us .
so , let 's explore .
it felt like a revolution .
and so jon had a brilliant idea : he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to create this dance troupe — the league of extraordinary dancers , the lxd .
it 's based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
there 's millions connected .
so , it 's easy to find the good stuff , and when you 've found it , you can watch it in close-up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it .
you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you .
so , this possibility of a new type of global recognition , i think , is driving huge amounts of effort .
and the hardest part about that is probably the light , because it means you have to open up , you have to show your stuff to the world .
it 's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation .
if you take programmers , you know , the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation .
if it 's all puppies , porn and piracy , we 're doomed .
it packs a huge amount of data , and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it .
here , let me introduce you to sam haber .
and i have to tell you , as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines , i find this strangely beautiful .
there 's a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
here 's one such frustrated scientist , moshe pritsker , the founder of jove .
he told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this .
reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .
so , that primal medium , which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
now , ted is just a small part of this .
and so , as we 've thought about this , you know , it 's become clear to us what the next stage of ted 's evolution has to be .
but the good news is they are out there .
( video ) christopher makau : hi . my name is christopher makau .
i 'm one of the organizers of tedxkibera .
there are so many good things which are happening right here in kibera .
there 's a self-help group .
because of a scarcity of land , we are using the sacks to grow vegetables , and also [ we 're ] able to save on the cost of living .
if you do n't have that , you do n't have understanding .
if you want to tie a tie knot , there are patterns .
when we throw something up in the air , it falls down .
this is also an invented language .
here you see just lines with different widths .
they stand for numbers for a particular book .
so i have to continue my investigation and look for the true pattern .
well , no .
one perspective is , it 's a sum .
this is one of the most beautiful equations .
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 is a television or a computer screen .
so these are all nice representations , but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number .
they sound like this together . ( beeps ) this is the sound of four-thirds .
i 'm just viewing a number from another perspective .
i can even make a little hi-hat .
well , as a matter of fact , you 've seen a bunch of r 's , and you 've generalized and abstracted all of these and found a pattern .
so what i 'm aiming for here is saying something about how understanding and changing your perspective are linked .
and i can change the axis , and then i can view it from another point of view , but it 's the same thing , but it looks a little different .
this is the graph structure of an octahedron .
do you see what i 'm doing here ?
we can hear the sound of the waves .
we can do a little game .
it 's a wonderful way to train your brain .
( applause )
and in front of all that noise , you do a very small gesture .
noise becomes music .
( laughter ) all those great people here , virtuosos , they make noise , they need me to do that .
so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want , and you have perfect harmony . it does n't work .
then you have the clapping audience , yeah , actually taking part in doing the music .
`` you know , arthur rubinstein , the pianist , used to say that , `` '' anywhere in the world , people that have the flu , they go to the doctor . ''
the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time .
people who build this wonderful concert hall .
can you sing , please , the first note of don giovanni ?
audience : ♫ aaaaaaah ... ♫ itay talgam : come on , with me . if you do it without me i feel even more redundant than i already feel .
( laughter ) and then — sort of — ( laughter ) so not only the instruction is clear , but also the sanction , what will happen if you do n't do what i tell you . ( laughter )
`` so he says , `` '' if i 'm — ( applause ) if i 'm responsible for mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told . ''
`` three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of la scala , musical employees , i mean the musicians , saying , `` '' you 're a great conductor . we do n't want to work with you . please resign . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' why ? because you do n't let us develop . ''
now , either he is senile , and does n't remember his own music , because he wrote the music .
itay talgam : good . now like a karajan . since you 're already trained , let me concentrate , close my eyes . come , come .
( laughter ) but i 'll tell you how they do it . no cynicism .
`` and when karajan is asked about it he actually says , `` '' yes , the worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction . ''
why are the eyes closed ?
no , it 's not , because he is not telling them what to do .
but how does it really work together if it does n't give them instructions ?
( laughter ) it is very tiring . yeah ?
`` i have a short notice to give you . '' '' you know , when it 's needed , the authority is there . it 's very important . ''
( music ) another solo now . see what you can pick up from this . ( music )
so again , the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work , and creative and all of that .
so control is no longer a zero-sum game .
( laughter ) did you see lenny 's face ?
you can see the baton left his hand . no more baton .
you 're seeing here images of three years , four-year-olds , and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation .
i was 15 when i was gang-raped by eight men .
i never felt like a victim , then or now .
but what lingered from then till now — i am 40 today — is this huge outrageous anger .
two years , i was ostracized , i was stigmatized , i was isolated , because i was a victim .
right from the age of 15 , when i started looking around me , i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices , but have absolutely no respite , because we do n't allow them to come in .
i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families , and children from well-to-do families , who are getting trafficked .
and we are silent about them .
we think the person likes to do what she 's doing .
we felt , one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage .
my biggest challenge is society .
i 'm asking you , in your limited world , can you open your minds ? can you open your hearts ?
and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know .
that is , every day , 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes .
that 's a haiti earthquake every eight days .
or maybe you turn to the past .
maybe it would have been much worse , or maybe it would have been better .
so what do you do ?
to give the aid , and hope and pray that something comes out of it ?
or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen ?
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
`` so this is what you call a `` '' last mile problem . '' '' the technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it does n't happen . ''
for 10 dollars , you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them .
`` `` '' not so fast , '' '' say other people . ''
`` they 're not going to use them , or at least they 're not going to use them as bed nets , maybe as fishing nets . '' '' so , what do you do ? ''
and a third question : education .
how do you know ?
imagine you are a mother in udaipur district , rajasthan .
so let 's try them .
afterwards , the camp — just having the camp — increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent .
so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions .
and the third one is : do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
we can just run an experiment .
and now we can see what happens .
so , how about the purchasing ?
they need to know : out of all the things i could do , what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
now i 'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .
and that 's not bad . for your hundred dollars , you get between one and three extra years of education .
we need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to guide policy .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
and they are good , scientific , robust answers .
so , why is that ?
you can not helicopter people out of poverty .
here 's an example of how this can be powerful .
they are not beautiful and do n't kill anybody .
and yet , when the young global leader in davos showed the numbers i gave you , they started deworm the world .
so this evidence is powerful .
it 's not going to be easy .
these economics i 'm proposing , it 's like 20th century medicine .
it 's a slow , deliberative process of discovery .
i 'll tell you what happened .
so how do you feel about that — the whole — ma : well , it 's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .
`` you want to get the feeling of the room , and `` '' do people like me ? '' '' and `` '' will i really say something intelligent ? '' '' and all of a sudden i thought , `` '' well , wait a minute . ''
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
`` only girls are secretary of state . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) pm : because in her lifetime — ma : that would be so . ''
the women in bosnia were being raped .
but it was one of the first times that i did n't have to cook lunch myself .
ma : well i do think , when there are more women , that the tone of the conversation changes , and also the goals of the conversation change .
( laughter ) but the bottom line is that there is a way , when there are more women at the table , that there 's an attempt to develop some understanding .
`` now i have a saying that i feel very strongly about , because i am of a certain age where , when i started in my career , believe it or not , there were other women who criticized me : `` why are n't you in the carpool line ? '' ''
and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .
and my motto is that there 's a special place in hell for women who do n't help each other .
( applause )
i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design , and studying design in the public sector .
how did i get started in this business ?
a couple of years into the process , i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around , looking for design .
but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
and since that time in amsterdam , i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities , looking at design for common evidence of design that really is n't under so much of a designer 's signature .
and , approaching a building from a distance , you do n't see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a diebenkorn or something .
but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life — kind of unintended piece of design .
and going a little closer , you get a different perspective .
antoine predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in san diego called petco park .
red can be comical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana .
so , there 's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go .
i notice this stuff because i walk a lot , but here , private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector .
cities are the place where we 're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .
but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant , and almost an international model .
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
we 've based the design of our settlements , our business models , our transport plans , even the idea of economic growth , some would argue , on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity .
already that 's fallen to about 11 .
the moment when the world on average passes this peak , people wonder when that 's going to happen .
we have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
`` there is the story of `` '' the elves and the shoemaker . '' '' the people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them . ''
now we have the seven-league boots in the form of ryanair and easyjet .
and it 's an idea that i think is very prevalent at these ted talks , the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis , that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints , the idea that we 'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side , the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world .
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face , and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need .
it 's sensitive to place and to scale .
this is a photograph of the bristol and district market gardeners association , in 1897 .
promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who do n't have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they are n't using anymore .
what does it look like if that 's not the case ? and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody ?
the challenge , of course , is to answer this question : what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?
think about it . if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile , but it had to start off to be this big , then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .
( laughter ) and you can absolutely never , absolutely never , because of history and the inherited plan , start with a clean slate .
and they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system because we 're biomechanists . it 's actually a pogo stick .
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick . how is that true ?
and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down , but they 're also bouncing side to side at the same time .
human technologies have tended to be large , flat , with right angles , stiff , made of metal . they have rolling devices and axles . there are very few motors , very few sensors .
they can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself .
let 's go to the video , and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries .
now , i said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks — they 're bouncing along as they move . and you can see that in this ghost crab , from the beaches of panama and north carolina .
it actually leaps into the air , and has aerial phases when it does it , like a horse , and you 'll see it 's bouncing here .
( laughter ) ( voice : oh my god . ) ( applause ) robert full : it 'll go on different surfaces — here 's sand — although we have n't perfected the feet yet , but i 'll talk about that later .
they 're going at a meter a second . how many think the one on the left is running up the wall ?
and here 's some video at 1,000 frames per second .
here are the robots that they inspire , the mecho-geckos from irobot .
first we 'll see the animals toes peeling — look at that .
peeling in the animal . peeling in the mecho-gecko — that allows them climb autonomously . can go on the flat surface , transition to a wall , and then go onto a ceiling .
and if you look at the toes , they have these little leaves there , and if you blow them up and zoom in , you 'll see that 's there 's little striations in these leaves .
the smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae , and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends , to get very close to the surface . in fact , there 's the diameter of your hair — a gecko has two million of these , and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends .
do they do it by interlocking ? that 's kind of a like a velcro-like thing .
if you need a message , if nature 's not enough , if you care about search and rescue , or mine clearance , or medicine , or the various things we 're working on , we must preserve nature 's designs , otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
so if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants .
and the correlation , of course , is that denser places tend to have lower emissions — which is n't really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place , suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable .
so we 're talking about things like infill development : really sharp little changes to where we have buildings , where we 're developing .
urban retrofitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .
and this is a huge , huge energy savings , because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars .
all around the world , we 're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life .
and when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we 're starting to see , what you find is , in fact , even more access suffused into spaces .
and as we just heard earlier , of course , we 're also learning how to put information on dumb objects .
and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time , use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .
buildings are becoming bundles of services .
we cool them with breezes . we heat them with sunshine .
this is vancouver 's propaganda about how green a city they are .
do they , perhaps , include green infrastructure , so that we can take runoff and water that 's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ?
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?
`` because right now , our economy by and large operates as paul hawken said , `` '' by stealing the future , selling it in the present and calling it gdp . '' '' and if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we 're going to run out of future really fast . ''
we all have our biases .
bias can be about race , it can be about gender .
and it almost tripled their chances of getting in .
what does that tell us ?
but , hey .
`` can you imagine me walking in and being like , `` hey boys , this is what 's up . this is how it 's done . '' ''
and the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it , but i 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it .
and two out of every three do n't have an executive who 's from a minority .
and most of the minorities that are at that sort of level are non-executive board directors .
so their influence is n't that great .
`` you 're like , `` '' oh my god , how bad is that ? what can i do about it ? '' '' well , fortunately , we 've identified that there 's a problem . ''
and as i 've said before , we live in a world where we 're looking for an ideal .
think about it .
she 's an inspiration .
and if you do n't know where to find someone different , go to the places you would n't usually go .
i know you 've been given a lot of challenges today , but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently , because diversity is magic .
thank you .
and after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes , it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed .
and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil .
the whole world , at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves , only gives us about 45 years .
sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still do n't understand what it is i 'm drawing .
all different materials , all different styles , all different times , drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of rome .
they continue without their tablecloth , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .
so , he keeps on moving , approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street .
everybody knows carletto , because he 's in entertainment , actually ; he 's in television .
he removes it , the problems are solved , everybody in the palazzo is happy .
and then i thought , that 's too complicated . no , i 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i 'll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale , so you can see the top of sant'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space .
you can see that in 1635 , it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever .
but more importantly , i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco , which is more often the case .
ok , if i do n't open the book the whole way , if i just open it 90 degrees , we 're looking down the front of the pantheon , and we 're looking sort of at the top , more or less down on the square .
so , these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on , which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon — she lives outside the walls of the city of rome — to someone in the city .
i have all the pieces : there 's santa maria della pace , there 's a soccer ball , there 's a little bit of a bird 's wing — nothing 's happening , so i had to rethink it .
`` past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about ; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon `` '' ristorante '' '' sign , and so on . ''
he removes the message from the leg of the bird ; this is what it says .
they 'd been struck by a sperm whale , which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship 's hull .
as their ship began to sink beneath the swells , the men huddled together in three small whaleboats .
no search party was coming to look for these men .
and i think it 's no accident that we think this way .
but maybe it 's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults .
`` the same incredible imaginations that produced `` '' the origin of species , '' '' `` jane eyre '' and `` the remembrance of things past , '' also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontăť and marcel proust . ''
well let 's return to the year 1819 for a moment , to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship essex .
but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water .
like all stories , fears have characters .
picture a cannibal , human teeth sinking into human skin , human flesh roasting over a fire .
if i 've done my job as a storyteller today , you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship essex .
if an earthquake strikes tonight , i used to worry , what will happen to our house ? what will happen to my family ?
once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
looked at from this angle , theirs becomes a story about reading .
a good reader has an artist 's passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader 's intuitive reactions to the story .
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios .
thank you . ( applause )
hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , u-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin ' .
( laughter ) listen , you 'll see being dead is dandy .
he forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me — the guy who usually goes too far .
i 'd be like some kind of internet genius , and me , i 'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that — pop ! — i 'd go wireless .
this region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults , and this is actually a meta-analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world , and they all show the same thing , that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence .
this is the same set of shelves from his point of view .
`` there are three trucks there . you 're going to instinctively go for the white truck , because that 's the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , `` '' oh , he ca n't see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , '' '' which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial . ''
you 'll see that this is exactly the same condition , only in the no-director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule , whereas in the director condition , they have to remember to take into account the director 's perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior .
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain .
so for example , take risk-taking . we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . they do .
so the limbic system is right deep inside the brain , and it 's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing . it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things , including taking risks .
and you 're on the inside , and it 's everything you hoped it would be .
and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way , we 're going to think about it like this .
and so we got this , or we had a choice of that . oh , stop clapping .
this one , this is going to be the new world trade center : a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it .
now , i do n't mean romantic as in , this is a nice place to take someone on a date .
and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time .
everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one .
this is just the outline of it , and you can see , does it look like a regular building ? no .
what makes the building expensive , in the traditional sense , is making individual parts custom , that you ca n't do over and over again .
that 's because it 's cheaper .
and they said , well , it 's summer , what do you do ?
so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
they took photographs , they fed the photographs into their computer program , and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into — at their instructions , using standard software with slight modifications — a set of instructions for pieces of wood .
looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
this is happening by itself .
and finally , it 's about comfort , it 's about making you feel good in places that you would n't have felt good before .
this is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
this is where people were handing them in , and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them .
otherwise , that little girl is n't going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged .
( applause ) over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more retouchers were needed , and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
within japan , by july , we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata , further north to a town called yamada .
the older ladies sometimes had n't seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it 'd start being fixed .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that was n't still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
you woke up , felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door , encountered new colleagues and had great discussions , and felt in awe when you found something new .
now the brain may not look like much from the outside — a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous — but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
and part of that 's because we 're bathing the brain in the chemical .
this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance .
that 's also why , perhaps , most of the drugs , and not all , on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too .
so again , we 're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control .
so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
and he 'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
these are the dopamine neurons , which some of you may have heard about , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder — a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning — where a tone ends with a brief shock .
the animal will react by freezing , sort of like a deer in the headlights .
and the animal 's going to hear a tone — and a flash of light occurred there .
and there 's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner , so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
okay , there it goes . right now .
and now you can see , just 10 minutes into the experiment , that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory .
and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin .
i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
eb : right , yeah .
eb : sure , yeah . we 're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings , and use that to understand more about the brain .
let me start off showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before .
and if this happens , an inland sea would fill a good portion of the mississippi valley .
for , in weather , we 're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters , but with life itself .
larry brilliant : should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ?
there 's two degrees , or three degrees of climate change baked into the system .
even though we 've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb , and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade , as he had forecast , we eat as if we were 20 billion .
that 's why in june of this year , we passed , as a species , 51 percent of us living in cities , and bustees , and slums , and shantytowns .
darfur is , at its origin , a resource war .
last year , there were 85,000 riots in china , 230 a day , that required police or military intervention .
and unlike destabilized world in the past , it will be broadcast to you on youtube , you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones .
what will that do to bangladesh ? let 's take a look .
and we 'll watch as global warming makes them melt . more water comes down , the deforested areas , here in the tarai , will be unable to absorb the effluent , because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water .
now we 're looking down south , through the kali gandaki .
and now let 's look from the south , looking up , and let 's see this in relief .
a minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas , coupled with increasing flows from the himalayas . and take a look at this .
as many as 100 million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate into india and into china .
this is the difficulty that one country faces .
with the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans , we live in each other 's viral environment .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in central africa from it ?
but they 're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did .
and on july 7th , around the world , i learned only yesterday , there will be global live earth concerts .
now , that does n't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most .
and you 've heard so many inspiring stories here , and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine .
it should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history .
it 's not ancient history .
when you read the biblical plague of boils , that was smallpox .
and most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created .
doctors , health workers , from 30 different countries , of every race , every religion , every color , worked together , fought alongside each other , fought against a common enemy , did n't fight against each other .
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
and i think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what i call a filter bubble .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
in a broadcast society — this is how the founding mythology goes — in a broadcast society , there were these gatekeepers , the editors , and they controlled the flows of information .
in 1915 , it 's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities .
it was a journey , an expedition in antarctica , the coldest , windiest , driest and highest altitude continent on earth .
so as camping trips go , it was a long one , and one i 've seen summarized most succinctly here on the hallowed pages of business insider malaysia .
of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us , none had made it to the pole and back , and five had died in the process .
this is captain robert falcon scott .
and for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished .
as a kid , i was inspired by the literature of adventure and exploration , and i think we 've all seen here this week the importance and the power of storytelling .
so it 's a bit different these days , and there are also acres of junk .
i think it 's a marvelous thing that humans can exist 365 days of the year with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters , but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes .
as much as you might like to think , as i do , that you 're the kind of person who does n't quit , that you 'll go down swinging , hypothermia does n't leave you much choice .
being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar , which is that i 've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that i can find .
on the way back down to the coast , our crampons — they 're the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier — broke on the top of the beardmore .
behind us lay an unbroken ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles .
we 'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot , something i 'd been dreaming of doing for a decade .
there 's something in that .
a room like this , nonetheless .
they had waited their whole lives for this moment , just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world , and just as my grandmother waited for the oprah winfrey show to come on channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock .
and as she made her way to the altar , i snuck right in behind her , because i knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven .
and i thought that if i held on to her hand during this prayer , i might go right on with her .
i had believed .
i can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me ; when the thing i believed most certainly turned out to be , if not a lie , then not quite the truth .
but when i found myself back home one winter break , with my face planted in the floor , my hands tied behind my back and a burglar 's gun pressed to my head , i knew that even the best education could n't save me .
( laughter ) we did n't know where 'd we go or how we 'd get there , but we knew we had to do it .
we went on 8,000 miles across america in the summer of 2013 , through the cow pastures of montana , through the desolation of detroit , through the swamps of new orleans , where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line .
but it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that i 've come to share with you today .
under a full-size replica of a whale , i sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds .
no , i was disturbed because i had finally realized that i was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant .
but this time , the false savior was me .
you see , i 've come a long way from that altar on the night i thought the world would end , from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of god and took a text to be infallible truth .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
the gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing , it asks that you believe a new thing : that it is possible not to believe .
this doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization , mbas across america , out of business .
we have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission .
and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook .
handwriting is a disappearing art .
and one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body .
it all boils down to two issues . one , humans are not rats , and two , despite our incredible similarities to one another , actually those tiny differences between you and i have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us .
and this is a schematic of a bioreactor we 're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular , scalable way .
i will start by posing a little bit of a challenge : the challenge of dealing with data , data that we have to deal with in medical situations .
it 's a fantastic device .
and let me step back in time .
imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this .
but of course , the block of data just contains the amount of x-ray that 's been absorbed in each point in the human body .
this is a huge challenge for us to do that .
i want to look at the heart .
so please go back home , tell your kids to play more games , because that 's what i need .
so really what i 'm doing is using these fantastic little devices .
it 's very high-resolution , and it 's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details .
and this is a bit of science fiction now , so we 're moving into really the future .
he 's taken the pen , and he 's moving it towards the heart , and he 's putting it on the heart , and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient .
and this , i think , is really the future for heart surgeons .
so this is really neat .
so this is something that we 've been working on .
so he could actually see things in the goggles .
so this is a cat scan — computer aided tomography .
and then , of course , i get the whole data set from the lion .
the only problem is to fit it into the machine .
and you might want to cuddle this one , until you change the functions and look at this .
so , some very talented people .
what about art ?
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
all of them are not angels , but they 're not monsters either .
that 's where i realized the power of paper and glue .
not a smile — that really does n't tell about who you are and what you feel .
we called the project face 2 face .
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
( applause ) we even pasted on israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and , you know what , even easy .
so for example , in june 2008 , i was watching tv in paris , and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de janeiro — the first favela of brazil named providencia .
`` and she said , `` '' you know what ? ''
they were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
`` i 've been seeing it around me the last few days . '' '' so that 's a really symbolic pasting , because that 's the first one we did that you could n't see from the city . ''
everyone there understood the project .
so how can we know about the project ?
so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them .
`` are you an ngo ? are you the media ? '' '' art . just doing art . ''
during that time , you have n't thought about what you 're going to eat tomorrow .
this is kibera , kenya , one of the largest slums of africa .
this time we covered the roofs of the houses , but we did n't use paper , because paper does n't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house — vinyl does .
`` `` oh , that guy just moved . '' ''
( applause ) thank you .
so we did n't get caught this time .
each project — that 's a film from women are heroes .
( applause ) and that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
that 's rio .
they are home .
i say we are an urban animal .
they have strange names : uclg , united cities and local governments ; iclei , the international council for local environmental issues .
and the list goes on : citynet in asia ; city protocol , a new organization out of barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries .
they fix sewers , they get the trains running .
bloomberg in new york was a democrat , then he was a republican , and finally he was an independent , and said the party label just gets in the way .
they get things done .
but the second thing about mayors is they are also what i like to call homeboys , or to include the women mayors , homies .
you can run for the senate out of a different state , but it 's hard to do that as a mayor .
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be .
cities do n't worry about number one .
organizations like the c40 , like iclei , which i mentioned , have been working together many , many years before copenhagen .
los angeles cleaned up its port , which was 40 percent of carbon emissions , and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon .
they are sharing what they do , and they are making a difference by shared best practices .
yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders , a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders , maladies sans frontières , médecins sans frontières , of economics and technology without borders , of education without borders , of terrorism and war without borders .
mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors , and i love that idea , because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us , of you and of me .
it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves .
with all the risks to his safety and his health , some would say no .
we have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with .
we ca n't solve for death .
i know some of you are working on this .
i heard about this lake , lake imja .
i put on my ipod , i listened to some music , i got myself as aggressive as possible — but controlled aggression — and then i hurled myself into that water .
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters , and then i realized very , very quickly , i had a huge problem on my hands .
take some time to rest and think about things .
and remember , never ever swim with aggression .
and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self-cleaning , dry adhesive has been made .
from the simplest version in nature , one branch , my engineering collaborator , ron fearing , at berkeley , had made the first synthetic version .
and so has my other incredible collaborator , mark cutkosky , at stanford — he made much larger hairs than the gecko , but used the same general principles .
lynn verinsky : honestly , it 's going to be perfectly safe . it will be perfectly safe .
but she actually used these on smooth surfaces — two of them — to climb up , and pull herself up .
here is the actual robot .
if we can show some of the video , you can see it climbing up the wall .
so what they did was they asked us an important question .
and you can also have active tails .
it can also be used in defense .
and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
and the way it does it , is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left , and it swings its other way to yaw right .
it can actually swim through the air .
what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ?
you can see it even better from down on top .
watch the whip of its tail as it does it . look at that .
so now we were really confused , because there are no reports of it gliding .
now watch up there and you can see the landing . did you see it hit ?
it actually uses its tail too , just like we saw in the lab .
and of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it .
naturally , they blew up a shack , and caltech , well , then , hey , you go to the arroyo and really do all your tests in there .
so , that 's what we call our first five employees during the tea break , you know , in here .
wherever anybody else looks , look somewhere else , and go do something different , you know , and doing that .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
it 's not very appropriate to do it now . some people tell me to do it ; i think , well , that 's not really proper , you know , these days .
some of the most brilliant engineers i know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them .
you 've got to do what you want to do .
is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars ?
and one of the first , or the easiest , places we can go and explore that is to go towards mars .
it has polar caps . it has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours , so it has weather . so , it 's very similar to some extent , and you can see some of the features on it , like the grand canyon on mars , or what we call the grand canyon on mars .
it is like the grand canyon on earth , except a hell of a lot larger .
so , that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet .
and these rovers , people wonder now , what are they doing today , so i thought i would show you a little bit what they are doing .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that 's the rover on the surface .
as i said earlier , it looked very much like earth , so you see sand dunes .
and as you can see , this is a picture of the spacecraft put on mars , but i thought that just in case you 're going to miss that show , you know , in 17 days , i 'll show you , kind of , a little bit of what 's going to happen .
bc : from this point , we 're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour down to 900 miles an hour .
and that would be bad .
bc : we 've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity .
and edl itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes .
ce : hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
to give you an idea of the size , you know , of that parachute relative to the people standing there .
hopefully it all will work , you know , it will work that way .
so it will have an arm which will take samples , put them in an oven , crush and analyze them .
so that 's why you have these gaps , is because a small satellite , you know , is being formed in that location .
and that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one .
so this is a yellowstone , you know , of saturn .
and somehow , through some dynamic effect , we 're having these geysers which are being , you know , emitted from it .
you barely can see ourselves . so what i did , i thought i 'd zoom on it .
howard is not so easily placated .
had he been racing against the winner of the 1904 olympic marathon , he would have won by nearly an hour and a half .
to give you a sense of how much it is , i want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist ross tucker .
in 1954 , sir roger bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile .
as of the end of last year , 1,314 men had run under four minutes in the mile , but like jesse owens , sir roger bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today .
only 530 are left .
that was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug .
but as that idea started to fade away , as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type , you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches , a form of artificial selection took place , a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports , and athletes ' bodies became more different from one another .
the financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed , and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance .
and that 's not the only way that nba players ' bodies are unique .
had leonardo wanted to draw the vitruvian nba player , he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse , not a circle and a square .
so in sports where large size is prized , the large athletes have gotten larger .
and as the large got larger , small got smaller , and the weird weirder .
in swimming , the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs .
and this shows in athletes ' bodies today .
we think of kenyans as being great marathoners .
thirty-two kalenjin men did that last october .
there 's no explosion there .
what 's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once , and they 're throwing themselves across the room .
but the more we learn about how that limiter functions , the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit , in some cases by convincing the brain that the body wo n't be in mortal danger by pushing harder .
and we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running .
they have no buns because they do n't run upright .
thank you very much .
but unlike the other speakers , i 'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world .
or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy .
`` and there 's another in-joke among statisticians , and that 's , `` how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician ? '' ''
this evening , there 's a reception in the university 's museum of natural history .
`` when they say to you , `` '' what do you do ? '' '' — you say , `` '' i 'm a statistician . '' '' ( laughter ) well , except they 've been pre-warned now , and they 'll know you 're making it up . ''
so here 's the scene for the first question i 'm going to ask you .
so on this side , you 've got a number — you 've done it lots of times , so you get it accurately — which is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail .
we start tossing a coin , and we get a head — and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful , or awesome , might be about to happen .
on this side , there 's a different experience .
you 're a little bit excited with the first head — you get rather more excited with the next tail .
if it 's a tail , you crack open the champagne .
another way of thinking about it — if we tossed a coin eight million times , then we 'd expect a million head-tail-heads and a million head-tail-tails — but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps .
it 's another way of getting the intuition .
there 's a much deeper connection , which i do n't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
and we 'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that .
but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated — you 'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story — but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .
and i will give you two little snippets — two examples — of projects we 're involved in in my group in oxford , both of which i think are rather exciting .
there 's a second big project , recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country , involving very large studies — thousands of individuals , with each of eight different diseases , common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes , and coronary heart disease , bipolar disease and so on — to try and understand the genetics .
it gets it right 99 percent of the time .
come on — everyone 's got to get involved .
it 's not the answer , and it 's not because it 's only part of the story .
amongst all these other people who do n't have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time .
here 's the key intuition .
each of them taken together is unlikely .
here 's a more topical example of exactly the same thing .
he looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like sally clark 's is about one in 8,500 .
so if a family suffers from one cot death , you 'd put them in a high-risk group .
they 've probably got these environmental risk factors and/or genetic risk factors we do n't know about .
the other explanation is that she was guilty .
now , we probably think a priori that 's unlikely .
and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that 's unlikely , because of the presumption of innocence .
it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence .
we know the children died .
well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life .
it 's also true — and , although , you , as a collective , are very special in many ways , you 're completely typical in not getting the examples i gave right .
it 's very well documented that people get things wrong .
we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly — and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
`` and everyone said , `` '' well , that 's fine . he 's an expert . '' '' so we need to understand where our competence is and is n't . ''
`` it 's all very well to say , `` '' let 's do our best to present the evidence . '' '' but more and more , in cases of dna profiling — this is another one — we expect juries , who are ordinary people — and it 's documented they 're very bad at this — we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on . ''
then i realized , maybe that 's a little bit lofty for now .
sr : so what was going on in my brain while i was recalling the memory of an ex ?
it should act at the speed of the brain , in milliseconds .
so steve , how about let 's zap the brain with electricity ?
so your best response of defense is trying to be undetected .
they want to know , what 's going on in this new box ?
but the moment we turned on the laser , like you see now , all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode .
could we possibly even turn it into a false memory ?
xl : indeed , we are living in a very exciting moment where science does n't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination .
sr : and finally , what do we make of all this ?
nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we 're sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
first , there 's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking .
it 's a place where we do n't have to worry about how we 're being perceived by the outside world .
it 's a place of loyalty and trust .
the men often recounted their doctor 's recommendations to cut salt in their diet or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking or to reduce stress .
that means that almost every single black man either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it .
denny , like many barbers , is more than just an artist , a businessman and confidant .
he was also orchestrating a voter registration drive to give a voice to his customers and his community .
first , the barbershop is not a medical setting , and so it does n't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that .
after all , conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk : stress and high blood pressure , food and high blood pressure , relationships and high blood pressure , and yes , what it 's like to be a black man in america and high blood pressure .
you can concretely take action .
these pioneers paved the way for my professional journey with barbershops and health , which began in chicago in medical school .
what is your barbershop ?
here 's an example : if i were to tell you , let 's play a little coin toss game , and i 'm going to flip a coin , and if it comes up heads , i 'm going to pay you 10 dollars , but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me , most of you would say , sure , i 'll take that bet . because you know that the odds of you winning are one half , the gain if you do is 10 dollars , that multiplies to five , and that 's more than i 'm charging you to play . so , the answer is , yes .
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .
but in fact , there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place .
you kind of shout out the sound , s — and the word comes .
you also have a 20-dollar bill .
and i 'm going to show you one or two of them .
( laughter ) the comparison changes how we evaluate him .
so i 'm telling you something you already knew : namely , that comparison changes the value of things .
they 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
in fact , these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they 're going to enjoy the potato chips .
but if you drove across town , you could get it for 30,900 .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it 's worth 100 bucks no matter what you 're saving it on . people do n't think that way .
`` i mean , compared to all these people who hate me when i try to speak their language and hate me more when i do n't , these people are just wonderful . '' '' and so you tour france with them , and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner , and what do you find ? ''
now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ?
what you see here are two lads , one of them larger than the other : the fireman and the fiddler .
here are the results of what i just showed you .
we already know , for example , in the united states , more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes — because they were scared — and driving on highways , than were killed in 9/11 . ok ?
is terror the right response ?
what is it ?
second , these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again .
i think in the case of terrorism , it is n't .
ca : there 's no question .
but if you got attacked , that was something you could do something about .
dg : well , you know , the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves .
aubrey de grey : my name 's aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .
`` i think in general you 're battling a very fundamental human tendency , which is to say , `` '' i 'm here today , and so now is more important than later . '' '' ca : dan , thank you . members of the audience , that was a fantastic session . thank you . ''
and the kind of social network i 'm talking about is not the recent online variety , but rather , the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years , ever since we emerged from the african savannah .
so , i form friendships and co-worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today .
a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now .
so here on the y-axis , we have the percent of the people affected , and on the x-axis , we have time .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect , and then you get the plateau of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
for instance , sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties .
but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view , you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and b .
now , who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network ?
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services .
so the random group is in the red line .
if we could understand the structure of networks in villages , we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads .
so the truckers are just going about their business , and they 're buying fuel .
or , finally , it can be more fully active — as i know subsequent speakers will also talk about today — where people might globally participate in wikis , or photographing , or monitoring elections , and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena .
`` in fact , the availability of these data , i think , heralds a kind of new era of what i and others would like to call `` computational social science . '' ''
this was how computing began .
do n't forget : a computer came out ; it had no software .
you 'd buy that thing , you 'd bring it home , you 'd plug it in , and it would do absolutely nothing at all .
she 'd make this kind of , like , wall of tofu cooking , and it would confuse the customers , because they all thought it was a restaurant .
like back here , there 's like , concrete block technology here , and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu , because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing , and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard .
and that was torture , real torture .
because , you see , we 'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it , like , knife in , zap , zap , zap . we thought , wow .
so i kind of switched . i went to mit , finished .
this is the first sort of play thing i did , my own serious play .
now , i was saying , well , that 's the whole point : it 's moving .
it lasts forever . it 's a very strange medium .
this is actually bad : human experiments .
and someone sits down and draws a picture .
`` and then someone discovered this `` '' a-ha moment '' '' where you could use coordinate systems . ''
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people , called a human-powered computer .
and this computer 's programmed to do only one thing , which is , if you move your mouse , the mouse changes on the screen .
he 's the guy that kind of discovered me , and kind of got me going in digital media .
it 's real simultaneity . it 's nothing we 're used to working with .
`` and also , at the same time i was frustrated , because i would go to all these art and design schools everywhere , and there were these , like , `` '' the computer lab , '' '' you know , and this is , like , in the late 1990s , and this is in basel , a great graphic design school . ''
and here 's this , like , dirty , kind of , shoddy , kind of , dark computer room .
i made — i took my old macintoshes and made different objects out of them from tokyo .
and so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction .
this is a series of lamps i made . this is a bento box lamp : it 's sort of a plastic rice lamp ; it 's very friendly .
i 've done shoes for reebok as well , as a kind of a hobby for apparel .
we have this gene defect in our mind .
this is also out there , you know .
i 'm , like , how did this happen , kind of thing ?
i brought you guys together again .
and so i realized it was o.k . to go .
and i say , well , i 'm going to bring the future back to risd .
it 's a strange exuberance about materials , about the world : a fascination that i think the world needs quite very much right now .
so , it was sort of the right idea at the right time .
leibniz , who came a little bit later — this is 1679 — showed that you did n't even need subtraction .
but , there 's one catch . this is the fatal — you know , we saw it in starting these programs up .
so , the programming has to be perfect , or it wo n't work .
such a computer would open up universes , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instruments .
these were not theoretical physicists .
they were real soldering-gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
all the computers now are copies of that machine .
this is the archetype of the hard disk that 's in your machine now .
and that 's what i 've been doing , this last six months , is going through the logs .
so they are always trying to figure out , what 's machine error ? what 's human error ?
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
`` `` '' no use , went home . '' '' ( laughter ) `` impossible to follow the damn thing , where 's a directory ? '' ''
`` ( laughter ) here , `` '' a mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack , set blower to vibrating . result : no more mouse . '' '' ( laughter ) `` here lies mouse . born : ? . died : 4:50 a.m. , may 1953 . '' ( laughter ) ''
if you 're a mathematician , you get that , because marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there .
`` `` '' i have now duplicated both results . ''
he 's still ahead of some of the stuff that 's being done now .
it was published in the literature .
and they did start to evolve .
and he went around the country after that .
it was n't any sort of creator intelligence , but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence .
and there 's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago .
`` `` there must be something about this code that you have n't explained yet . '' ''
this was published after he died : his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines , what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce .
( applause )
let me take a step back .
we are people with different bodies , gender expressions , faiths , sexualities , class backgrounds , abilities , and so much more .
i have another confession .
bad feminism — or really , more inclusive feminism — is a starting point .
if i listen to degrading music , i am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply .
we can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing .
i found my voice again , and i started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure .
in india , we have these huge families .
which means that there are a lot of family events .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes .
it works just purely on its form .
the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors , and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup .
but i really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective .
because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries .
`` so he took really long to reach this position , and then all this while , i 'm thinking , `` '' oh my god , is he really going to do it ? ''
so it happens a lot , so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms , making them feel much more confident ?
others will turn to their friends , their family , looking for support .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
here 's the crux of the obstacle .
but the way that our institutions are designed , in our rather 18th-century , centralized model , is to channel the flow of values through voting , once every four years , once every two years , at best , once a year . this is a rather anemic and thin way , in this era of social media , for us to actually express our values .
we 've entrenched them . and we know that the smartest person always works for someone else .
we live in a cambrian era of big data , of social networks , and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent .
but private communities , private , corporate , privatizing communities , are not bottom-up democracies .
we need to think about how to open up the api of government , and the way that we 're going to do that , the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution — because we have to maintain those public values , we have to coordinate the flow — but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks , all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions , to engage in the practice of governance .
but it 's not just about policing government .
it 's also about creating government .
and we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data , not simply to make apps , but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government .
and so , really , so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet .
it wasn’t a function of how old or how sick they were — it was mainly how much they changed , and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little naive .
everybody who smokes knows it’s not good for you , and still 30 percent of americans smoke — 80 percent in some parts of the world . why do people do it ?
and i’ll talk more about this , but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking — it’s loneliness and depression .
and telling people they’re going to die is too scary to think about , or , they’re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary , and so they don’t want to think about it , so they don’t .
the most effective anti-smoking ad was this one .
`` you’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth , and `` '' impotence '' '' — the headline is , `` '' impotent '' '' — it’s not emphysema . ''
you feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
on a low-fat meal , the blood flow doesn’t go down — it even goes up .
but it doesn’t last , which is the problem .
and it’s the volume of food that affects satiety , rather than the type of food .
if you don’t remember anything else from this talk , three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent .
and that’s how your body excretes waste , is through your breath , your bowels and your perspiration .
and whether or not you have conventional treatment , in addition , if you make these changes , it may help reduce the risk of recurrence .
but also , through mechanisms that we don’t fully understand , people who are lonely and depressed are many times — three to five to ten times , in some studies — more likely to get sick and die prematurely .
just take a look at one study . this was done by david spiegel at stanford .
i grew up in a typical american town near st. louis .
my six siblings and i were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble .
for example , if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour , both of us will need an assistive device called a car .
using a mouse cursor i control with my head , these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser .
with this drone setup , we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination , where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else , and perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables .
i would have died .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
( applause ) thank you .
this meeting has really been about a digital revolution , but i 'd like to argue that it 's done ; we won .
this is showing making bits , this is showing — once again , slowed down so you can see it , bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing .
this was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically , where you write a code , much like protein folding , that specifies their structure .
you can do other things . that 's in 2d . it works in 3d .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that do n't control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
you know , hundreds of people came in begging , all my life i 've been waiting for this class ; i 'll do anything to do it .
they had no conventional technical background .
when a user screams into scream buddy , their scream is silenced .
this student 's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you 're awake ; this is one that defends — a dress that defends your personal space .
you do n't need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique .
ken olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
there was a girl who insisted we stay late at night — ( video ) : kids : i love the fab lab .
this is late at , you know , 11 o'clock at night and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time .
and , again , that was just for the joy of it .
it was very chaotic , it was n't , sort of , clear what was going on .
in dc , i go to every agency that wants to talk , you know ; in the bay area , i go to every organization you can think of — they all want to talk about it , but it breaks their organizational boundaries . in fact , it 's illegal for them , in many cases , to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology .
i thought that 's the projection 20 years hence into the future , but it 's where we are today .
the hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering , but it 's here today .
now why is that curious ?
when i first got interested in this , i thought , well , it 's a straightforward problem in biology .
i think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness .
either it does n't exist at all , or it 's something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it 's not part of science .
here 's how it went .
and i have only one real message in this lecture , and that is , consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis , digestion , mitosis — you know all the biological phenomena — and once you accept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate .
`` some days it goes up and some days it does n't go up . '' '' no . it goes up whenever i damn well want it to . ''
dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
you ca n't get rid of it .
well , the first one i said was , consciousness does n't exist , it 's an illusion . well , i 've already answered that .
and the bottom line of this part of my talk is this : you can have a completely objective science , a science where you make objectively true claims , about a domain whose existence is subjective , whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness .
so the objection that you ca n't have an objective science of consciousness because it 's subjective and science is objective , that 's a pun .
that 's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity .
i wo n't demonstrate pain behavior , but i can tell you i 'm not having any pains right now .
when i got my current job , i was given a good piece of advice , which was to interview three politicians every day .
for 30 years , i 've been covering school reform and we 've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes — charters , private schools , vouchers — but we 've had disappointing results year after year .
and it 's produced a great amputation , a shallow view of human nature .
we 're really good at talking about skills and safety and health ; we 're really bad at talking about character .
and so this is part of what life is , but it 's not all of what life is .
the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species , the unconscious mind does most of the work .
people with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they 're actually sometimes quite helpless .
`` and the `` '' giant '' '' in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning — antonio damasio . ''
we emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply interpenetrated , one with another .
and we see this when lovers walk down the street , when a crowd in egypt or tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion , the deep interpenetration .
we are now children of the french enlightenment .
the first gift , or talent , is mindsight — the ability to enter into other people 's minds and learn what they have to offer .
a second skill is equipoise , the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind .
men drown at twice the rate of women , because men think they can swim across that lake .
and that comes in tremendously handy , because groups are smarter than individuals .
and then the final thing i 'll mention is something you might call limerence .
( laughter ) so this screenshot is from a sales video that gamma produced .
they really are selling their software around the world .
as i said , it 's a $ 5 billion industry .
( music ) you have to hack your target .
`` [ skype & encrypted calls , target location , messaging , relationships , web browsing , audio & video '' '' ] being stealth and untraceable . ''
`` [ `` '' immune to any protection system hidden collection infrastructure '' '' ] deployed all over your country . ''
they 've spoken at the conferences .
so as i said before , governments that do n't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software , and so for that reason , you see that the government of , say , tunisia , might use the same software as the government of germany .
they 're all buying off-the-shelf stuff .
my friends at an organization called the electronic frontier foundation — they 're a civil society group — obtained hundreds of documents from the fbi detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies .
i 'd never heard of it .
there were lots of former u.s. government contractors who had at one point worked for the remote operating unit , and were describing in surprising detail on their cvs what they had done in their former job .
we all use the same technology , and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys , they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too .
the other thing about formula 1 in particular is we 're always changing the car .
so how do we do that ?
can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better ?
now , when you look at some of the data on the screen above , things like heart rate , pulse , oxygen , respiration rates , they 're all unusual for a normal child , but they 're quite normal for the child there , and so one of the challenges you have in health care is , how can i look at the patient in front of me , have something which is specific for her , and be able to detect when things start to change , when things start to deteriorate ?
and so we installed a real-time link between the ambulance and the hospital , just using normal 3g telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care .
it 's telling us that something is going wrong .
the green is us learning what is normal for that child .
so we have a very ambitious program .
we think that the race is on to do something differently .
( applause )
i started taking a look as well at different perimeters , because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data .
and it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset , so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through at & t 's data and revealing itself .
`` so you 're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city , until we approach new year 's eve , where everybody says , `` '' happy new year ! '' '' ( laughter ) so this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city . ''
i asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left .
and i collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
i think there 's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil — something we can all relate to , this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing .
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
`` i expected people to be wondering , `` '' why did i draw a sheep ? '' '' and i think it 's a pretty valid question . ''
this basically allowed — what you see on the left side is the original frame , and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they 're doing .
( laughter ) so the last mechanical turk project i 'm going to talk to you about is called bicycle built for 2000 .
and i was writing software to visualize laser scanners .
this is actually two of my favorites : the pin-board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke .
a whole youtube channel of people submitting really interesting content .
collaborator six : watching the video in my room , i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
it 's the sum total of his life , all the things that had happened — the bad things , the good things .
i 'll use a mix .
and the clean , clear water that comes out the other end is traveling underground to water each person 's yard .
this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
do you want this in your yard ?
i got really curious about this question .
and i care so much about this question , that i work for a nonprofit called recode .
but it was allowed in five other states nearby .
and all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure .
`` brave and open-minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying , `` yeah , that shit makes sense . '' ''
i keep showing examples where everyone 's reusing everything on-site .
`` every time you flush the toilet , i want you to think , `` '' where is my poop and pee going ? ''
after graduation , and despite knowing that i wanted a phd in astrophysics , i fell through the cracks .
it was a poster that saved my dream , and some really incredible people and programs .
the american physical society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists .
one hundred percent of the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study by joan c. williams at uc hastings reported facing racialized gender bias , including being mistaken for the janitorial staff .
beyond that , though , it underscores that the women of color in stem do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face .
do not think for one minute that because you are who you are , you can not be who you imagine yourself to be .
hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you ca n't even imagine .
`` dr. alexander said it this way : `` '' i 'm used to walking between two cultures . ''
`` his name was barnaby jack , and this technique was later called `` '' jackpotting '' '' in his honor . ''
i 'm here today because i think we actually need hackers .
he believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution .
and i feel the same way .
they scare us .
in true ted fashion , here is my most embarrassing picture .
i remember one late night i found a bit of php code .
but with great power comes great responsibility , and you all like to think that if we had such powers , we would only use them for good .
what would you do then ?
making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community , and it is controversial , but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day .
frustrated with the exchange , he took to use his own discovery to post on mark zuckerberg 's wall .
but i think there 's a greater story here still .
`` it worked so well , in fact , one guy even used it to download an episode of `` '' how i met your mother . '' '' but while egypt 's future is still uncertain , when the same thing happened in syria just one year later , telecomix were prepared with those internet lines , and anonymous , they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the syrian military by defacing their website . ''
hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century .
he 's the nsa director and u.s. cyber commander , but instead of his four star general uniform , he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt .
i think he saw untapped potential .
the rules of the game are not that clear anymore , but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field .
thank you . ( applause ) hack the planet !
and the farthest galaxy is a trillion , trillion kilometers away .
as an astrophysicist , i have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects in our universe .
in this image , i 'm interested in where this white blob forms and if , as a result , there 's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material .
as we more confidently localize where these gamma ray blobs are forming , we can better understand how jets are being accelerated , and ultimately reveal the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed .
so the conclusion with the families — and this is important , not our conclusion — with the families , was that we had a problem .
we had to innovate .
the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability .
in 2012 , we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center , and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation .
we wanted to have a working space with the right light , with the right temperature , with the right air .
so we asked ourselves : does the typical office building help us in that sense ?
so we thought , well , maybe we have to turn this scheme inside out .
you do n't require sophisticated programming .
thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation .
so this alternative was irresponsible .
done well , of course .
there is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question .
and what they said was , look , fine to protect the city against future tsunamis , we really appreciate , but the next one is going to come in , what , 20 years ?
but every single year , we have problems of flooding due to rain .
by doing so , we were able to save four million dollars , and that is why the forest is today under construction .
for one year , i would say yes to all the things that scared me .
no , but yes .
and a crazy thing happened : the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear , made it not scary .
i made a vow that from now on , every time one of my children asks me to play , no matter what i 'm doing or where i 'm going , i say yes , every single time .
and it 's had a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it 's also had a stunning side effect , and it was n't until recently that i fully understood it , that i understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career .
four television programs , 70 hours of tv — ( applause ) three shows in production at a time , sometimes four .
( applause ) now , i do n't tell you this to impress you .
and it is all of those things at the same time .
the hum is more than writing .
now , my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan .
they 're baby titans .
i was a titan you could take home to your mother .
we play , and we 're joined by her sisters , and there 's a lot of laughing , and i give a dramatic reading from the book everybody poops .
i feel it .
the real hum is love-specific .
the real hum is singular and original .
the real hum is god 's whisper in my ear , but maybe god was whispering the wrong words , because which one of the gods was telling me i was the titan ?
it 's a law , so i do n't have a choice , and i do n't have a choice , not if i want to feel the hum .
i 'm not interested in doing it the way i 'm interested in doing work .
i work all the time because i like working .
you can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play .
my kids are my happy place , they 're my world , but it does n't have to be your kids , the fuel that feeds your hum , the place where life feels more good than not good .
`` `` '' wan na play ? '' '' starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways i 'd given up on right around the time i got my first tv show , right around the time i became a titan-in-training , right around the time i started competing with myself for ways unknown . ''
work does n't work without play .
it takes a little time , but after a few months , one day the floodgates open and there 's a rush , and i find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody , full on groove inside me , and around me , and it sends me spinning with ideas , and the humming road is open , and i can drive it and drive it , and i love working again .
i am not that hum . that hum is not me , not anymore .
i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends .
love 's hum .
wan na play ?
so here 's what suki would do in search of a mate .
we were walking along with my husband in one of abu dhabi 's big fancy malls .
here are three of mine .
one day , i got to present my research to a roomful of mba students .
`` it 's just never going to happen . '' '' it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications , but once i did , i reached three conclusions . ''
as for the arab woman , our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband .
you need to work your life .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since alia was six months old .
this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation , whether an au pair , nursery , part-time nanny that you share with someone else .
i have done this ever since alia was a baby .
it was a young consultant , a saudi lady and friend , who helped me sell my first project in saudi arabia , a market i was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
i remember it clearly .
`` and when that happens , are you sitting there going , `` no , the movie 's about to start , '' or are you going , `` '' that 's fantastic . i 'm looking forward to it . ''
now i 'm going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
it is n't just about nice .
pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl 's drawing .
well it obviously is n't .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
but they 're both different .
i ca n't tell you how wonderful this is .
and of course , a racing bike does n't have a prop stand , but this one , because it 's a road bike , it all goes away and it folds into this little gap .
but unfortunately , the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty .
i moved three things by a millimeter .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
while she 's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you , something horrible 's going on down here .
the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on .
now i 'm using microseconds wrongly here , so please ignore me .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i 've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but i have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
it 's fantastic , is n't it ?
form follows function ?
it informs , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we 've even thought about it .
thank you very much .
( video ) groucho marx : charlie , you should have come to the first party .
( music : seinfeld theme ) ( video ) george costanza : oh boy , i was up til four in the morning watching that omen trilogy .
`` i was surprised at the tedster/ '' '' rugrats '' '' overlap . ''
( video ) didi pickles : it 's four o'clock in the morning .
roy : no , it 's not an accident . you wanted to get out of the house anyway , right ?
`` ( movie montage of `` '' it 's 4 a.m. '' '' ) ( laughter ) rives : so somewhere along the line , i realized i have a hobby i did n't know i wanted , and it is crowdsourced . ''
but i was also thinking what you might be thinking , which is really , could n't you do this with any hour of the day ?
if this is confirmation bias , there is so much confirmation , i am biased .
there are seven four in the mornings , and they 're all very dire .
`` someone sent in h.g . wells ' `` '' the invisible man . '' '' someone else sent in ralph ellison 's `` '' invisible man . '' '' `` `` the great gatsby '' '' spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows , and the most famous wake-up in literature , perhaps , `` the metamorphosis . '' ''
first paragraph , the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach , but we already know , cockroach notwithstanding , something is up with this guy .
`` so that 's lucy from the peanuts , `` '' mommie dearest '' '' , rocky , first day of training , nelson mandela , first day in office , and bart simpson , which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category , people waking up , in my big old database . ''
i started archiving .
( music ) l.d . was my college romance .
i have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards , not just from l.d. , from my life , but for decades .
it sounds silly , but i thought , okay , the way the world works can be changed , and it can be changed by me in these small ways .
`` and the creator of this , he said , `` this is fire . i call this fire . '' ''
we know how it 's supposed to work , so we ca n't suppose all the things that could be possible .
`` i 'm going to use them a different way . '' '' so let me show you a little demo . ''
flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin .
i do n't even have access to a facial piercing if i wanted to .
and this young woman , she made what she called a hula-looper , and as the hula hoop traveled around her body , she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there .
so i 'll just plug it in , and now it 's on by usb .
you guys are facing that way , so i 'll hook it to this one .
get a bowl of water . this is just photo booth on your mac os .
`` we 're like , `` '' we 're sponsoring you , man . ''
and so next time you 're on an escalator and you drop an m & m by accident , you know , maybe that 's an m & m surfboard , not an escalator , so do n't pick it up right away .
two hundred years of modern science .
but here 's the problem : say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane .
of course , you 're going to find thousands of scientific papers — great papers , where scientists are going to say this is a great material , there are lots of things we can do with it .
and we produce this mountain every year .
think about insects .
it turns out , they make this wonderful material , which is called resilin .
but in fact , the reason is much more fundamental .
so every living cell , whether coming from a plant , insect or human being , has a dna that encodes for nanobio building blocks .
why collagen ?
the source of all that collagen is actually coming from dead bodies : dead pigs , dead cows and even human cadavers .
but it 's not the only one .
and more recently , even , we 've been able to launch into the market here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers , that is now approved for use in the clinic .
this is happening now .
in the future , we believe we 'll be able to make many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us — collagen , nanocellulose , resilin and many more .
now , this heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor .
and the text is the dna of life .
and along the way i 've started noticing — i 'm on my third generation of kids — that they 're getting bigger .
but i 'm the oldest sixth grader you 'll ever meet , so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i 'm hoping to share with you all today .
and it starts with three people .
and i do n't like weeding , and i do n't like back-breaking labor .
and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america with our bronx borough president .
really scholastic , if you ask me .
we are poised , ready , willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we 've never even imagined .
produce pete ca n't believe what we grow .
so we started giving back .
and thank god trinity wall street noticed , because they gave us the birth of green bronx machine .
now , how does it start ? it starts in schools .
group by broccoli , group by your favorite vegetable , something you can aspire to .
how does it start ? well , look at jose 's attention to detail .
and behold the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
we 're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent .
i expect them to be engaged , and man , are they !
black field , brown field , toxic waste field , battlefield — we 're proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
and we take orders for flowers . i 'm putting the bake sale to shame .
and again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we 're really creating a moment .
forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance .
amazed people . the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
self-sustaining entities , 18 months return on investment , plus we 're paying people living wage and health benefits , while feeding people for pennies on the dollar .
one got us invited to the white house , one 's a recent incarnation .
but most importantly , just love them .
i 'm steve ritz , this is green bronx machine .
it is n't just that . we 're seeing it all over the world .
my field , the field of psychology , has n't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .
( laughter ) and freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system — which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
but unfortunately , we need this system in part .
we 've come away from the freudian gloom , and people are now actively studying this .
we do n't seem to have a word for that .
they like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies .
there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes — about 50 percent — but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for .
and the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times .
it gives objects what 's called incentive salience .
`` the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it 's quite interesting , is use of the first person singular — `` i , '' `` me , '' `` my , '' not `` '' we '' '' and `` '' us '' '' — and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone . ''
the other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status .
i end with a few quotes .
`` then do what you have to do . '' '' thank you . ''
`` i went to school , i got good marks , i had a very low-key after school job in my mum 's hairdressing salon , and i spent a lot of time watching `` buffy the vampire slayer '' and `` dawson 's creek . '' ''
i was n't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all .
and in fact , i am sitting on this stage looking like i do in this wheelchair , and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you . right ? ( laughter ) yeah .
they are not things to do with our bodies .
they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary .
and i know what you 're thinking .
i 'm learning not that i am luckier than them , though .
it 's just not going to happen .
i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
thank you .
but most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them .
that 's a third of the world 's population .
and even then , the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business , averaging around 150 dollars .
we could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network .
these are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person 's creditworthiness .
and after analyzing all of these different data points , we took the first risk and gave jenipher a loan .
but it proves trust .
`` i went out and did a lit review , 3,000 articles on the key word `` '' slavery . '' '' two turned out to be about contemporary — only two . ''
they are not causal , they are actually supporting factors .
but that does n't make you a slave either .
all around the world i 've been told an almost identical story .
ten miles , 100 miles , 1,000 miles later , they find themselves in dirty , dangerous , demeaning work .
now , that kind of slavery is , again , pretty much what slavery has been all through human history .
i just want to share a little clip for you .
d : exciting stuff indeed . gentlemen , thank you very much .
there are no roads there , so they carry loads of stone on their backs , often of their own weight , up and down the himalaya mountains .
`` i do n't know if you 've ever had a daydream about , `` '' wow . what would it be like to meet harriet tubman ? ''
well , first , before i even tell you the cost i 've got to be absolutely clear .
well , amazingly , in places like india where costs are very low , that family , that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery — so , that granddad there , was born a baby into slavery — but the total cost , amortized across the rest of the work , was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education .
in the united states , north america , much more expensive . legal costs , medical costs ...
that 's important , all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom , because we 'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in 1865 .
dumped without political participation , decent education , any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives , and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination .
now , this woman lived in a village in nepal .
okay , thank you so much .
i was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia .
there 's a long tradition in asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender .
there is a hindu goddess , hijra goddess .
she convinced me that if i joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments , and that night , i won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among 40-plus candidates .
i could no longer live my truth for and by myself .
i am here , exposed , so that one day there will never be a need for a november 20 vigil .
they acted sweet .
they really enjoyed each other 's company .
and the girls decided to make it an annual event .
the fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them did n't even have for a while .
even the guards cried .
`` i 'll never forget that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said , `` daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? '' ''
`` then i remembered the quote from gloria steinem , which goes , `` '' the truth will set you free , but first it will piss you off . '' '' ( laughter ) so — ( laughter ) so with that in mind , i 'm going to set about trying to do those things here , and talk about dying in the 21st century . ''
while i give this talk , in the next 10 minutes , a hundred million of my cells will die , and over the course of today , 2,000 of my brain cells will die and never come back , so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece .
we have machines that go ping .
there 's many of them up there .
`` so we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like `` '' lifesaving . '' '' i really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we do n't . ''
he 's got pneumonia , and he looks like he needs intensive care .
so i go down to the ward and see jim , and his skin his translucent like this .
you can see his bones through the skin .
jim was 94 . ( laughter ) and i realized that something was n't happening here .
one in a hundred .
now , i work in acute care .
what we know is that obviously we are all going to die , but how we die is actually really important , obviously not just to us , but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards .
in miami , it 's three out of five people die in intensive care .
the dying process of those with terminal illness that we 've just seen occurs to younger people .
she 's the one he 's looking at , and [ she 's ] the one he 's coming for . can you see that ?
there has to be a little side road off there for people who do n't want to go on that track .
the small idea is , let 's all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .
i think we have to get onto this .
i suggested we should have occupy death .
`` yeah , yeah . sure . '' '' ( laughter ) so that one did n't really run , but i was very struck by this . ''
so i 'm an opponent of euthanasia , but i do think we have to give people back some control .
this is a quote from dame cicely saunders , whom i met when i was a medical student .
she founded the hospice movement .
thank you . ( applause )
in hospitals there , there 's a community of nurses , physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years : lassa virus .
and it was frightening , frightening for us all .
we 'd already set up this kind of capacity for lassa virus , we knew how to do it , the team is outstanding .
and it came into sierra leone not as that singular case , but as a tidal wave .
now , that 's incredibly important when you 're trying to figure out how to intervene , but the important thing is contact tracing .
and there are so many ways that we can form communities like that .
so in the early part of the epidemic from kenema , we 'd had 106 clinical records from patients , and we once again made that publicly available to the world .
we 're all in this fight together .
this is olusosun dump , the largest garbage dump in lagos , and 2,000 people work here , and i found this out from this fellow , andrew saboru .
i think what we have is a pickle problem .
big businesses have recognized this , and what 's fascinating about this slide , it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off .
`` we want our products in that store . '' '' and then there 's mobile phones . ''
now , most of the phones there are not second-hand at all .
you can buy pirated dvds , of course .
you look at supermarket sales .
they dated it from 2000 b.c. , so it 's 4,000 years old .
in this respect , the data has gone from a stock to a flow , from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic .
now , one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we 've always collected information on , but another reason why is we 're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data .
you know that somewhere , probably in a telecommunications carrier 's database , there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you 've been at all times .
now think , for example , of the issue of posture , the way that you are all sitting right now , the way that you sit , the way that you sit , the way that you sit .
so what could we do with this ?
maybe , if we aggregated the data , maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds .
one of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning .
arthur samuel knew something else .
so he wrote a small sub-program alongside it operating in the background , and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move .
he plays the computer . he wins . he plays the computer . he wins . he plays the computer . he wins .
`` we changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say , `` '' here 's a lot of data around the vehicle . ''
why do n't we use data about the person 's high school transcript ?
their fitbit , when it 's able to identify biochemistries , will show that they have aggressive thoughts .
think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it 's cancerous or not .
i wanted my monument to live in the world , and to circulate .
thank you .
that 's the first thing .
so , magnificent creature , is n't it ?
and this enables them to orient in complete darkness .
`` indeed , the very famous philosopher thomas nagel once said , `` '' to truly experience an alien life form on this planet , you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying , echolocating bat in complete darkness . '' '' and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat , you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it . ''
now , if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you , and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats , that 's probably not that surprising , because here in western culture , bats have been demonized .
but most bats are voracious insect predators .
they 're going to — they are very threatened in the united states of america alone .
well , it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation , we 're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops .
now when we 've been doing this , we 've realized that there 's variations within our genome .
so in my lab , we 've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
some ? how about 30 ?
so therefore , they must have something within their dna that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses , particularly of flight . they expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size , but do n't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects .
and hopefully in the next five years , i 'll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
these are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science .
benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation .
some did , not everybody .
it 's a future we do n't know the details of , but it 's a future that has signs , just like benki saw the signs around him .
egos , systems of government — figuring it out — massive change .
and in addition to that , we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future , a say we have n't even really started to hear yet — china , india , russia , south africa and benki 's own brazil , where benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution .
but you know all that .
you also know that we ca n't just keep doing what we 've always done , because we 'll get the results we 've always gotten .
of being a leader and a human in the world .
since that time , samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health ngo 's in india .
even that was n't enough .
sanghamitra told me just last week — she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough .
`` our dream is for our partners , our husbands , not to be given to us because of a horoscope , but to be given to us because they 've been tested for hiv . '' '' if you are lucky enough to meet sanghamitra and ask her why and how , how have you achieved so much ? ''
he 's been a soldier , a teacher , a politician , a vice-mayor and a business man .
`` but if you sat down and asked him , `` '' who are you really , and what do you do ? '' '' he would tell you , `` '' i 'm a collector , and i curate a museum . '' '' i was lucky ; i had heard about him for years , and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum in chengdu . ''
for example , he 's got over one million pieces documenting the sino-japanese war , a war that 's not talked about in china very much and whose heroes are not honored .
why did he do all this ?
he has nine other buildings — that are already open to the public — filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history .
two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the cultural revolution , a period that actually most chinese would prefer to forget .
and they have humility .
we ca n't wait for the next generation , the new joiners , to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need .
but the good news is that we do n't have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
more recently , we 've tried therapy dogs , wilderness retreats — many things which may temporarily relieve stress , but which do n't actually eliminate ptsd symptoms over the long term .
now , like any training , the best ptsd treatments require repetition .
you begin drowning in worries about dangers that are n't present .
you begin not trusting family or friends .
you turn it way down .
we train veterans to be fiercely rational , to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering , say , an ied here in peacetime america .
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room , where he could plan escape routes , where he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon .
because ...
but we must ensure that the science , the energy level , the value that we place on sending them off to war is at the very least mirrored in how well we prepare them to come back home to us .
this much , we owe them .
almost like a ghost , is n't it ?
château lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar .
bill koch is a florida billionaire who owns four of the jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious .
with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes , i decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine .
( laughter ) this was the first one .
it may come from wagyu cattle , but it 's not from the original , appalachian hyogo prefecture in japan .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real kobe , and one of them is wolfgang puck 's restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
i was really happy when i was done .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
that said , a lot of work goes into these .
but no compliments .
there 's a water jet that cleans you .
i do n't think it 's that bad of a deal .
and it was really amazing .
there 's not much of it left .
`` bipin desai is a u.c . riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , `` '' i 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the '47 cheval blanc . '' '' and it was going to be a double vertical — it was going to be 30 vintages of cheval blanc , and 30 vintages of yquem . ''
and it was an invitation you do not refuse .
there were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
( laughter ) we are going to focus on charles today , because it is charles ' 100th birthday .
the whole thing about this , though , is that , you know , why am i showing it ?
in some it is hot .
eames demetrios : now , this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the united states .
and yet , how did it start ?
so that was just a little snip .
and you know , those of us with kids often want our kids to take music .
this is something called a splint .
and they 'd been working on furniture before .
this is a house that charles and ray designed .
now look at that plastic chair .
the chair is done in 1949 .
this is the earlier design of that house .
the familiar one on the lower right .
and yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much , including what ended up being the ted prize .
design was not something other .
lucia angel , okay , eye .
video : your word is n. carolina .
so let 's watch that . nobody 's ever seen it .
so my point is that this scope of vision , this holistic vision of design , was with them from the beginning .
so this is charles ' voice .
there are things like silver-plated thalis .
but it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf .
`` `` beyond the age of information is the age of choices . '' ''
design is not just for designers anymore . it 's a process . it 's not style .
because a cave landscape , like this deep shaft in italy , is hidden , the potential of cave exploration — the geographical dimension — is poorly understood and unappreciated .
because we are creatures living on the surface , our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed , as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere .
so karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks , fractures , can easily dissolve soluble lithologies , forming a drainage system of tunnels , conduits — a three-dimensional network , actually .
and if we have a look at other planets like , for example , mars , you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet .
and in 2009 , i had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains , which are in the orinoco and amazon basins .
and they are , really , a lost world .
so how can it be possible ?
it was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain .
we did n't find a dinosaur .
so the implications for science are enormous , because here you could find , for example , microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine , or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties .
so they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation .
( applause ) fs : i have to thank the photographers from the team la venta , because all of those photos are from the photographers .
bg : you bring , actually , photographers with you in the expedition .
but when i look at these pictures , i wonder : there is zero light down there , and yet they look incredibly well-exposed .
and each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
trade has increased .
and perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the 21st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world .
and over the next 18 years have almost tripled .
growth of six percent a year . absolutely incredible .
thomas jefferson , i think , really expressed this quite well .
`` he said , `` '' he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine . ''
so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people .
the way i like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
how else can we create new ideas ?
the real tragedy of the last century is this : if you think about the world 's population as a giant computer , a massively parallel processor , then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line .
india is coming on line .
here is just some data . this is china .
that is something that we should embrace — a wealthy china , a wealthy india , a wealthy africa .
now you can see some of the reasons why i 'm optimistic .
globalization is increasing the demand for ideas , the incentive to create new ideas .
but some of our grandchildren probably will .
oil . oil . this was a big topic .
because the truth is , when they light their candles at ours , there is twice as much light available for everyone .
spread the ideas . spread the light .
by the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
the thought that you would n't want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
if you just walk outside , there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world , putting up wires to get power from where it 's created to where it 's used .
`` we do have a little bit of a reputation in the united states . '' '' so i thought i 'd better look it up first . ''
`` so definition number six is the north american definition of the word `` '' suck . '' '' wires suck , they really do . ''
40 billion of these things built .
they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
this all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife 's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power .
`` and he was thinking , `` '' with all the electricity that 's out there in the walls , why could n't some of that just come into the phone so i could get some sleep ? '' '' and he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer . ''
and those two coils of wire are really , really close to each other , and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly , only over a very short distance .
and then what you do is , you start out with electricity , turn it into magnetic field , take that magnetic field , turn it back into electricity , and then you can use it .
i mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
there are industrial applications .
these electric cars are beautiful .
we put one on the back of the television set .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
i think i heard somebody talk about that before .
so , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
they could go in the floor . they could go , actually , underneath your desktop .
so with my colleagues , daniel leithinger and hiroshi ishii , we created inform , where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it .
or you can visualize 3d information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways .
and you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3d data sets as well , so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them .
how do we move forward from here ?
imagining a solo cello concert , one would most likely think of johann sebastian bach unaccompanied cello suites .
the excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept .
and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists .
and one of the journalists said to her , what 's up ?
and that truth is , or was , in the 20th century , that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements , we did n't have an endangered people 's movement .
there 's a museum , of course , on the mall in washington , right next to lincoln and jefferson .
and that 's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world 's worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
now here — and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon — there is good news , amazing news , in the 21st century , and that is that , almost out of nowhere , there has come into being an anti-genocide movement , an anti-genocide constituency , and one that looks destined , in fact , to be permanent .
now , what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states , at a time of massive over-stretch — military , financial , diplomatic — a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making .
and the peacekeepers i 've mentioned , the force has been authorized , but almost no country on earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm 's way .
so this movement , if it 's to be durable and global , will have to cross borders , and you will have to see other citizens in democracies , not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide , but actually making it such .
he was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in iraq .
these are the places he was drawn to .
he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there .
and their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm 's way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .
and then after timor , 9/11 has happened , he 's named u.n. human rights commissioner , and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out , what do you do when the most powerful country in the united nations is bowing out of the geneva conventions , bowing out of international law ? do you denounce ?
one note on his death , which is so devastating , is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in 9/11 , believe it or not , the bush administration or the invaders did no planning , no pre-war planning , to respond to terrorism .
stateless . the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career .
you 're un-owned .
he just had the rules , he had the norms , and he tried to use them .
`` and in lebanon , southern lebanon in '82 , he said to himself and to everybody else , i will never use the word `` '' unacceptable '' '' again . ''
but by the end of his life , i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from .
all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .
you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person , that regime , is the problem and that you , the united states , are not the problem .
let 's not hype the threat ; let 's actually see it clearly .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
and then somebody complained .
`` a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? '' '' ( laughter ) and i was like , `` '' cool . bring it . '' '' because this time it was n't coming up . ''
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
when one dollar 's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars ' worth of produce .
so what happened ?
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
plus you get strawberries .
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
( applause ) so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , do n't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit — where you talk about doing some shit .
but we see the results of this technology , still .
it is made for a diet which is soft , mushy , which is reduced in fibers , which is very easily chewable and digestible .
those have to pay tuition fees know .
( laughter ) but it 's also , metabolically speaking , expensive .
cooking made it possible that mutations , natural selections , our environment , could develop us .
i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing , the continuation of the unleashing of human potential .
so because of having cooked food , it 's easier to digest .
what kind of criteria did it use ?
and something which maybe you do n't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat .
if you get a stomach ache , if you get a little bit bloated , was not the right food , was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .
`` all the managers in the room say , `` '' you do n't tell me something new , because we know , gut feeling . ''
now if there 's a gut brain , we should also learn to talk with this brain .
now 150 years ago , anatomists described very , very carefully — here is a model of a wall of a gut .
if we could unroll it , get out all the folds and so on , it would have 400 sq . meters of surface .
it has 20 different neuron types .
it 's this brain which makes this reflex .
i took here a model from robotics — it 's called the subsumption architecture .
what it means is that we have a layered control system .
so if we take two types of signals — a hunger signal for example .
so if you override the hunger signal , you can have a disorder , which is called anorexia .
despite generating a healthy hunger signal , the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut .
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens , when the constituents are liberated , they disappear , they go away because they [ were ] absorbed .
and i hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image , which is water .
how can we cook that we have this language developed ?
we have a coctivor 's opportunity , because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward — quite sophisticated to cook — to please ourselves , to satisfy ourselves .
if we add the matrix , if we add the structure language , which we have to learn , when we learn it , then we can put it back ; and around energy , we could generate a balance , which comes out from our really primordial operation : cooking .
thank you very much .
now plants are under threat .
and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us .
this is a nuclear-proof facility .
you label them . you do some high-tech things here and there , some low-tech things here and there .
we have training going on in china , in the usa , and many other countries .
how much does it cost ?
i think that 's cheap , at the price .
how many are there in the human genome ? three billion .
so this is of course orville and wilbur wright , and the wright flyer .
as you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .
so this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow — that 's tracing your name in the sky .
but audacious is what has happened many times before in history .
`` now , the reason i begin by saying `` '' no 9/11 , no war '' '' is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks — the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks — and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we 're about to be engaged in . ''
islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals .
and the goals from the perspective of muslims are , in principle , peace , justice and equality , but on terms that correspond to traditional muslim teachings .
other people would say it means something else .
some people would say that islam means submission .
there are a wide range of different things that islam can mean .
and ostensibly , the same is true of democracy .
but their governments , needless to say , are relatively threatened by this .
now , i began with the war because it 's the elephant in the room , and you ca n't pretend that there is n't about to be a war if you 're talking about these issues .
on the other hand , the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated , even by , and i would say especially by , people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place .
well , what i 'm here to say then is , for people who are skeptical about the war , it 's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the united states and the muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly islamic .
that 's a hopeful message , but it 's a message that 's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us .
so i got out to the street and threw rocks , not realizing i was supposed to throw rocks at israeli cars .
and we 'll eat together .
i have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
and secondly , they are the smallest reality .
but the effect of that presentation is , it appeals to sympathy .
what should we do with it ? we should give food to the hungry .
we should deliver medicines to those who are ill .
we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa , from a challenge of despair , which is called poverty reduction , to a challenge of hope .
sending somebody to school and giving them medicines , ladies and gentlemen , does not create wealth for them .
so , where should we be putting the money ?
we have n't exported one kilogram yet .
we import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from brazil and cuba .
i can tell you , even if you have ten ph.ds. , you can never beat bill gates in understanding the computer industry .
i want to use the example of my own country , called uganda , and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there .
the expected foreign aid : 1.9 trillion .
and i think that if you 're not , there 's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you 're in , if you 're a designer .
children almost always begin by being serious , which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class .
new york is serious .
serious design , serious play , is something else .
and what — the way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was , what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy .
i thought the typeface helvetica was the cleanest , most boring , most fascistic , really repressive typeface , and i hated everything that was designed in helvetica .
( laughter ) so — so , my goal in life was to do stuff that was n't made out of helvetica .
i was n't educated . i just sort of put these things together .
and first i was praised for it , then criticized for it , but the fact of the matter was , i had become solemn .
i spent most of the '80s being quite solemn , turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because that 's who i was , and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead , and getting rediscovered all over again .
and he 's taken on — he 's given , actually — a malpractice suit to handle that 's sort of an easy deal , and in the midst of trying to connect the deal , he starts to empathize and identify with his client , and he regains his morality and purpose , and he goes on to win the case .
this is what theater advertising looked like at that time .
and it was the only job , even though i was doing other jobs .
i did these things , and i still do them .
`` the high point of the public theater , i think , was in 1996 , two years after i designed it , which was the `` '' bring in 'da noise , bring in 'da funk '' '' campaign that was all over new york . ''
`` i said , `` '' why ca n't the signage be on the floor ? '' '' new yorkers look at their feet . ''
and it was serious play .
and then , inexpensive signage .
they were pretty serious , too . it was quite wonderful .
they would take me about six months initially , but then i started getting faster at it .
here 's the united states .
( laughter ) somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery , and i had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago , and i showed these paintings that i 'm showing you now .
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism , and one of those entities is our prisons .
and our prison system itself is stuck .
in the year 2007 , i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections .
we give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
to give you a feel for this idea , imagine the following scenario : you walk into your child 's day care center .
you can see the faces , but they do n't look distinctive , and none of them looks familiar , and it 's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter .
it 's called prosopagnosia , and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain .
brains are like muscles .
what it shows is that region right there , that little blob , it 's about the size of an olive and it 's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there .
so i got back in the scanner , i looked at more faces and i looked at more objects and i got a similar blob , and then i did it again and i did it again and again and again , and around about then i decided to believe it was for real .
your face metamorphosed .
your nose got saggy , it went to the left .
okay , now as you can see , the surface of the brain is all folded up .
there 's another one out on the outside surface again where there 's a couple more face regions as well .
now all these regions i 've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception .
do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses , like hearing ?
( sirens ) ( cello music ) ( doorbell ) in contrast , that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that do n't have a clear pitch , like these .
in fact , a few years ago , there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he 'd found a brain region for detecting food , and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this .
and his region responded the same to both sets of images .
i mean , it could have been otherwise .
the brain could have been a single , general-purpose processor , more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife .
the most fundamental questions remain unanswered .
third , how does all of this very systematic structure get built , both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species ?
there is another way , because essentially , animal products are just collections of tissues , and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues .
if we can succeed here , it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon .
this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
thank you .
and in the dallas mini-mart , a dallas mini-part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a bangladeshi immigrant works the register .
back home , raisuddin bhuiyan was a big man , an air force officer .
he holds a shotgun .
behind the counter , he lays in blood .
soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt , including a fee for dialing for an ambulance .
and years later , he would ask what he could do to repay his god and become worthy of this second chance .
twelve years ago , i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world .
in america , not so much .
metal peppered his face .
the man who shot raisuddin grew up in that stingier america .
he was getting arrested before he shaved , first juvenile , then prison .
his old influences quit him .
he read viktor frankl , the holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos .
by forgiving stroman publicly in the name of islam and its doctrine of mercy .
an america that still dreams , still strives , still imagines that tomorrow can build on today , and an america that has resigned to fate , buckled under stress and chaos , lowered expectations , an ducked into the oldest of refuges : the tribal fellowship of one 's own narrow kind .
the country i am so proud to call my own was n't living through a generalized decline as seen in spain or greece , where prospects were dimming for everyone .
on july 20 , 2011 , right after a sobbing raisuddin testified in defense of stroman 's life , stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved .
but america , generous with second chances to the children of other lands , today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own .
america still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an american .
but it is losing its luster at allowing every american to become a somebody .
for decades , the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10,000 .
if the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened , why were they so narrow in the first place ?
in 1943 , kanner published a paper describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds , ignoring the people around them , even their own parents .
for example , he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism .
one boy in his clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two .
they pounded the pavement in a london suburb called camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community .
the paper offered an alternate story of autism .
lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it .
these changes were n't happening in a vacuum .
by coincidence , as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time .
`` [ seventy ] years later , we 're still catching up to asperger , who believed that the `` '' cure '' '' for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers , accommodating employers , supportive communities , and parents who have faith in their children 's potential . ''
we ca n't afford to waste a brain .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
will i like the color ?
and since you do n't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear — ( laughter ) that means i found a few things .
i 've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
and if you do n't think you look good in something , you 're also probably right .
if you believe you 're a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you ca n't pull off .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
think back when you were just a kid .
( laughter ) well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it 's become pretty clear to me that we do n't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
and of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
most of what 's extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
well it 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .
you breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings .
they get to close the loop with their products .
we 're sieving the material , we 're using magnets , we 're using air classification .
and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
music goes straight to the emotional vein , into your bloodstream and right into your heart .
it was a project from nonny de la peña in mark bolas 's lab in usc .
`` i 'm using the word `` '' consciousness '' '' as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us . ''
now , you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader .
in vr , your consciousness is the medium .
but where are we now ?
this is the lumière brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them .
ok , here we go .
so , first : camera movement is tricky in vr .
in this shot here , where we 're moving up off the ground , i added acceleration .
i did that because i wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground .
( laughter ) vr makes us feel like we are part of something .
`` our film `` '' clouds over sidra '' '' takes you to a syrian refugee camp , and instead of watching a story about people over there , it 's now a story about us here . ''
what do we call it then ?
but here i am , intellectualizing a medium i 'm saying is experiential .
for the people watching at home , we 're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself , and even get a google cardboard of your own to try it with .
we played in cardboard boxes as kids , and as adults , i 'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again .
music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable for a very long time .
only i think this one surpasses it .
( applause )
the story begins in the late '90s .
in truth , liberal arts education no longer exists — at least genuine liberal arts education — in this country .
subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces , with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure .
in effect , civic-mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes .
at the same time , all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda , darfur , myanmar .
we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth .
bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives .
they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines .
but so does the importance of content .
students , in turn , continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .
it undercuts self-righteousness , radically alters the tone and character of controversy , and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground .
this is a political education , to be sure .
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
what is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here , needs to turn its attention to that collaborative , messy , frustrating , contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .
if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning , not the end of this adventure .
( laughter ) basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity .
the problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and you have more choice-driven societies .
what really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people .
before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most .
we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it .
that 's the honest truth .
and i want to speak a little bit , take us back about 30 years .
we 're speaking about the fact that across the terrace , the next tower is the ministry of finance , and there 's a lot of connection with us today , so we 're speaking within your temple today . okay ?
four months ago , we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country .
we are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature .
what was it that they were accused of ?
and to get an idea of what it consisted of , and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing , we can look at this second slide here .
and what we have here — i am not saying so , this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement . he said so .
and he 's telling us that for the $ 1.6 billion cost of the project , one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts .
now , the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector corruption , okay ?
listen . they 've had bailouts on wall street .
only here . so what was the reason for the generosity ?
so i started digging and writing and so and so on , and that work can be found , my personal work can be found at afraraymond.com , which is my name .
the central bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the freedom of information act .
it 's like that joke : i want whatever he 's drinking .
so they hit my question with a question .
that is about three and a half billion u.s. dollars coming out of a small — we used to be resource-rich — caribbean country . okay ?
you see ? but the ministry of finance , the permanent secretary of the ministry of finance , wrote me and said to me , that information is exempt too .
and public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities .
so here we have it . we have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded .
it 's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation .
and this is my reality check .
where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it 's without transparency , it will always be equal to corruption , whether you 're in russia or nigeria or alaska , it will always be equal to corruption , and that is what we are dealing with here .
it 's a huge problem . it 's an economic crime .
and let us continue working together to betterment in this situation , stability and sustainability in our society . thank you .
i think nature gave them a helping hand here .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
and so , you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .
but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you 've never heard of , you can probably live with that .
you see it in the middle east : people who , from gaza , are firing missiles at israel .
and it 's natural to do that .
good , because before i tell you about that good news , i 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .
and if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies , it 's a zero-sum situation .
so , their fortunes add up to zero .
so , there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life .
but it may . and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness , these webs that can be these channels for compassion .
it 's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world .
and i 'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .
so there 's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit .
`` i 'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call `` '' supermassive '' '' black hole at the center of our galaxy . ''
so , despite the fact that i 'm going to talk to you about an object that 's supermassive , and i 'm going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no finite size .
so why is it so important ?
it depends only on the mass of the object .
so , if i were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the university of oxford , it would become a black hole .
and this beautiful picture taken with the hubble space telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes .
almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
nonetheless , it 's given rise to the notion that maybe it 's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes , but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers .
and that 's the reason that for this experiment we 've used the world 's largest telescope .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
you 're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you do n't use this technique — in other words , just a picture that shows the stars — and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and to give you a sense of how short that is , the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy .
stars that we knew about before , that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible , take 500 years .
that 's kind of profound , in a way .
and as you can see , there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle .
so , we 're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
now , truth in advertising . right ?
using observations that are not the ones i 've shown you today , we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young .
and in fact , today , this is what we 're trying to figure out , this mystery of how do you get — how do you resolve this contradiction .
so , in fact , my graduate students are , at this very moment , today , at the telescope , in hawaii , making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage , where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars , and so few old stars .
to do that we 'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
and we hope to be able to test some of einstein 's theories of general relativity , some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form .
second , we 've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact , and understand , maybe , the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are , and how they work .
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .
another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
as recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five .
and i think that 's doable in well under 20 years .
and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator .
and so you end up with two choices .
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
and the answer is , really , that we do n't .
we all had a wonderful education .
that 's part of the reason we 're here today , part of the reason we 're successful .
and if you look at the economy , it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education .
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
that means that if the entire u.s. , for two years , had top quartile teachers , the entire difference between us and asia would go away .
now , the way the pay system works is there 's two things that are rewarded .
for math teachers majoring in math there 's a measurable effect .
and it 's a system with very high turnover .
`` i sat down and i thought , `` '' what is going on ? '' '' the teacher was running around , and the energy level was high . ''
`` what 's going on ? '' '' and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids were n't paying attention , which kids were bored , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board . ''
`` so imagine running a factory where you 've got these workers , some of them just making crap and the management is told , `` '' hey , you can only come down here once a year , but you need to let us know , because we might actually fool you , and try and do a good job in that one brief moment . '' '' even a teacher who wants to improve does n't have the tools to do it . ''
but i 'm optimistic about this , i think there are some clear things we can do .
and in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that dvds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
`` now there 's a book actually , about kipp — the place that this is going on — that jay matthews , a news reporter , wrote — called , `` '' work hard , be nice . '' '' and i thought it was so fantastic . ''
( applause ) now , we put a lot of money into education , and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .
but i — i 'm optimistic .
`` i mean , is there something wrong with you ? '' '' i said , `` '' no , i 've got the best eduction . ''
the education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
who is a professional ?
these are professionals all over the world .
you find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
you come for the money , you do n't come to barefoot college .
it 's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher .
`` i said , `` '' yes , they made the blueprints , but the barefoot architects actually constructed the college . '' '' we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they did n't believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the barefoot architects of tilonia . ''
this is what it looks like today .
but it actually does n't leak .
since 1986 , it has n't leaked .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister .
puppets is the way we communicate .
he is my psychoanalyst . he is my teacher .
he 's my donor .
`` if there 's tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there 's a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , `` '' shake hands . ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) so this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we 've covered all over india from ladakh up to bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained .
in six months , how do we train these women ?
you use sign language .
this woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop — the first village ever to be solar-electrified in afghanistan [ was ] by the three women . this woman
`` i said , `` '' she 'll be happy . she 'll ring you up on the mobile . '' '' she went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger . ''
`` and when i went back six months later , i said , `` '' where 's your husband ? '' '' `` oh , somewhere . it does n't matter . '' ''
( laughter ) success story . ( laughter )
do n't listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
that 's a decent amount .
that 's pretty good too .
soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found , and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of .
given the limitations of our man-made machines , synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food , our fuel and our environment , but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space .
well , i mentioned earlier that we , as a species , were evolved uniquely for planet earth .
as difficult as it is to see , homo sapiens , that is humans , evolves every day , and still continues to evolve .
but then again , what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious ?
thank you .
so the question we really need to ask ourselves is , why , given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual , never mind the scale of the societal problem , why are there no effective treatments ?
( laughter ) but believe me , this is n't going to take very long .
there 's the nerve cell , and then there 's the myelinating cell , or the insulating cell .
and when these four cells work together in health and harmony , they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity , and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think , to emote , to remember , to learn , move , feel and so on .
you get damaged wiring .
you get disrupted connections .
john i saw just last week in the clinic .
just to be clear : it 's not because of doctors .
it 's in spite of doctors , not because of doctors .
all that screening occurs in animal models .
one of them was here in edinburgh , and it must be the only celebrity sheep , dolly .
but crucially , you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts , ideally from an unaffected relative .
but i want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage .
and again there are two ways to think about this , and they 're not mutually exclusive .
and that 's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking , which makes sense , because their nerves are dying .
but i 'd also like to add to john and to others that my own view is , i 'm hopeful for the future .
y2k , the dotcom bubble , stressing about whose party you 're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight , before the champagne goes flat , and then there 's that inchoate yearning that was felt , i think , by many , that the millennium , that the year 2000 , should mean more , more than just a two and some zeroes .
well , we 're approaching 2015 , so we 'd better assess , how are we doing on these goals ?
well , i definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through , and here 's just a few reasons why .
all together , they achieved these results : increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals , life-saving anti-aids drugs ; nearly halved deaths from malaria ; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved .
still , 7.6 million children die every year of preventable , treatable diseases , and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting , a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment .
there 's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake , tens of millions of lives , or deaths , at stake , and , i 'd argue , the security and future of you and your family is also at stake .
so first of all , we 've got to ground this campaign in core polling data .
this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy , where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid .
this openness , this forcing openness , is key , and if it was n't entirely transparent already , i should be open : i 've got a completely transparent agenda .
long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live , with population increases , consumption patterns increasing , and conflict over scarce natural resources .
and look at the state of global politics today .
our world leaders , our global politics , currently ca n't get it done .
i started in 2000. let me finish in 2030 .
( applause )
the r & d piece — it 's crazy how little it 's funded .
back in 1992 , i started working for a company called interval research , which was just then being founded by david lidell and paul allen as a for-profit research enterprise in silicon valley .
i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books — after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people did n't think they could sell .
these people are n't that smart .
the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life ; that we can do good things , that there are things worth doing because they 're good things to do , and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them .
i 'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did — actually , some of the voices are more recent .
girl 1 : yeah , my character is usually a tomboy .
girl 9 : my friend justine kinda took my friend kelly , and now they 're being mean to me .
she asked me to make sure you knew about it .
if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters , we can go into this hidden hallway , and i 'll quickly just show you the interface .
and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives .
`` `` rockett 28 ! '' ''
one held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching .
i stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support , and watched her , and i did n't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring .
and i saw that gave her more tenacity , and she went after it again and again .
mastery is not just the same as excellence , though .
it 's not the same as success , which i see as an event , a moment in time , and a label that the world confers upon you .
painter paul cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again , but at the end of his life , the result was that he had only signed 10 percent of his paintings .
franz kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise , so much so that he wanted all of his diaries , manuscripts , letters and even sketches burned upon his death .
`` `` '' lord , grant that i desire more than i can accomplish , '' '' michelangelo implored , as if to that old testament god on the sistine chapel , and he himself was that adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that god 's hand . ''
we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
i stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room , how your lives might play this out , because i think on some gut level we do know this .
now it occurred to me , as i thought about this , why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice , out of earshot of his archers , that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team , never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins .
it did n't sound like a complaint , exactly , but just a way to let me know , a kind of tender admission , to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious , unfinished path that always required more .
ok. hands up : anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
that 's very good news , because i thought that was what the answer would be .
and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
`` and therefore , we 're not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . '' '' and that 's true . ''
and you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
that 's my answer to the overpopulation question .
i 'm now going to talk about feasibility .
in fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work — even cells we 're not really too good on yet .
but after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
which we can now , as i 've explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .
one has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
so they 'll probably think it 's five years away .
and finally , of course , i think it 's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier , the coping strategy .
we can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
the point about this slide is actually the bottom .
the list on the right is also incomplete .
cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
first of all , i 'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
so of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
( laughter ) it 's got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it 's basically got a 90 percent chance , i think , of succeeding in this .
( applause ) audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
ag : that 's right .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
i have n't told many people this , but in my head , i 've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time .
but i love to talk .
but that is a stereotype , and the stereotypes of things are often , if not always , wrong .
there 's the real world , the world that we all share , and there 's the world in my mind , and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world .
i 've got to rock backwards and forwards , or sometimes scream .
why are people pouring their brilliant individual light into a mold ?
and people would often write off someone who 's nonverbal , but that 's silly , because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for .
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
and here 's the worst news of all .
one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town .
in agile , workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time .
when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters , it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born .
companies followed the waterfall method , right , in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below , and no one had ever consulted the programmers .
inevitably , people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families .
you had blogs pop up , and some manuals were written .
sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever .
`` he said , `` '' in the workplace , adults love it . ''
everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on .
you know , the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves , and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids .
you know , greet five visitors at the door this week , get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed .
it turns out , by the way , our girls are little stalins .
plank number one : adapt all the time .
so time-shift family dinner . that 's adaptability .
enlist the children in their own upbringing .
`` the other one said , `` '' overreaction ! overreaction ! '' '' and started counting , and within 10 seconds it had ended . ''
and we ended up with 10 statements .
we are travelers , not tourists .
we do n't like dilemmas . we like solutions .
`` the family mission statement was on the wall , and my wife said , `` '' so , anything up there seem to apply ? '' '' and she kind of looked down the list , and she said , `` bring people together ? '' ''
suddenly we had a way into the conversation .
so my final plank is , tell your story .
almost anybody who 's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion .
it 's a matter of choice .
things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away .
thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats .
trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey .
but keep in mind , most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before i had tried to understand it .
these survivors do n't need saving .
this is our chance to do the same .
thank you so much .
preston reed : it 's mind-blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored .
so , for roughly 300 years , the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture , because the nose was one-fifth of your head , or because your head was one-seventh of your body .
in the 15th century , the decimal point was invented ; architects stopped using fractions , and they had a new model of nature .
much later , robert maillart 's bridges , which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola .
interestingly , in the last 10 years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery , with the structural engineer chris williams .
and as an architect , i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting , because i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment .
and here we 've broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods , and differentiated those neighborhoods .
but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components , one to another .
so , the first kind of test product we did was with alessi , which was for a coffee and tea set .
and you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size , but always within a , kind of , controlled limit , an envelope of change .
we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site .
the first thing the american missionary gave me was a candy .
and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate — of any race , of any party — in history .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
and the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural , and they are educationally impoverished .
we 're going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the general social survey .
this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year .
`` and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , `` would you not vote for a qualified black president ? '' ''
but also not everyone wants to live in a city , certainly not a city like new york .
you have real neighborhoods and real trees , and real streets you can walk on .
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
( applause )
when you think about it , the oceans are 75 percent of the planet .
it 's one of my favorites , because it 's got all sorts of working parts .
it 's got these fishing lures on the bottom . they 're going up and down .
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases .
and you can sit in a room like this , with a joystick and a headset , and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time .
on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the alps , so the setting here is very dramatic .
bl : the white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees c .
dg : i think that 's one of the greatest stories right now that we 're seeing from the bottom of the sea , is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria .
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water , another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria , which takes the hydrothermal fluid — that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom — and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest .
now , they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them .
these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria .
this is the first time we 've ever tried this any place .
there are smaller animals crawling around .
here 's pagoda structures .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
not only that , but on top — the lifeblood — that plumbing system turns off every year or so .
and then there 's earthquakes , and then volcanic eruptions , on the order of one every five years , that completely wipes the area out .
you 're talking about biodensities and biodiversity , again , higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life .
it 's an incredible story .
what we see when we look back in time , in those sediments and rocks , is a record of earth history .
oceans come and go . mountains come and go . glaciers come and go .
what we 're learning now , it 's almost like a symphony .
thank you .
( applause )
but something weird happened .
i do n't have time to explain it , but it has to do with dna and rna .
so for this reason , i 'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns .
so here 's the word puzzle again .
and for that same amount of time , i 've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers .
( laughter ) i 'm very interested in wonder , in design as an impetus to inquiring .
i think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature , and i 'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth .
this book is taking rather a long time , but i 'm nearly done .
believe it or not , i devised this as a timesaving method .
it did n't exactly work out that way .
so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards , and i made 500 of these .
i 'm just really , really thrilled with them .
but ultimately , i do n't consider that a worthy goal .
what makes something worthwhile for me is the people i work for or with , the conditions i work under and the audience that i 'm able to reach .
and it 's very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we 're not contributing enough , or worse , that all we 're doing is contributing to landfill .
in the 1990s , it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode , and in that mode , you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain .
you could n't do people like this . you could n't do healthy people .
that 's caused a literal revolution , and it 's opened us up to a new experimental preparation . neurobiologists , as you well know , have lots of experimental preps , worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this .
we can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings , and we have a few burgeoning biological measures .
okay , let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do , and it 's in the area of what you 'd call valuation .
valuation is just what you think it is , you know ?
they 're immiscible . they do n't mix with one another .
`` control passes to blue , and blue says , `` '' i accept it , '' '' in which case he 'd get the money , or blue says , `` '' i reject it , '' '' in which case no one gets anything . okay ? ''
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
like a job interview . you sit across the desk from somebody , they have some prior image of you , you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be .
we 're so good at this we do n't really even notice it .
in doing this , what we 've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
we just have n't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously .
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over .
i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america .
what are you in america doing about it ?
the problem of violence was stuck , and this has historically been the case in many other issues .
and then we looked at the maps , and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave , because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics .
we 're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides .
in other words , for t.b . you have to find somebody who has active t.b . who is infecting other people .
make sense ?
the sun was out . everybody was happy .
`` the economist in 2009 said this is `` '' the approach that will come to prominence . '' '' and even a movie was made around our work . ''
so i did n't mean to come up with this at all .
it was a matter of , i wanted actually a break , and we looked at maps , we looked at graphs , we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things .
( applause )
good morning everybody .
so we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
`` `` okay , '' i thought , `` here 's a first world country , let 's see what they can do . '' ''
do you know it took five days to get water to the superdome ?
people were shooting each other on the streets for tv sets and water .
so that 's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
we 're just going to pour that in there .
audience : ugh !
so i 'm just going to put that in there .
and some other bits and pieces , chuck that in there .
okay , so i 'm going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . do you want a drink yet ?
what 's it taste of ?
using the old thinking , of national infrastructure and pipe work , is too expensive .
`` so here is the `` '' thinking different '' '' bit . ''
this will process 25,000 liters of water ; that 's good enough for a family of four , for three years .
( applause ) so , by thinking differently , and processing water at the point of use , mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water .
with 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water .
i found this in the farmers ' market today , and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later , you 're very welcome to .
it grows and is nurtured .
basically a restaurant just like any other .
this is the restaurant , acorn house .
floor : sustainable , recyclable .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with resins , experiment with polymers .
right , here 's a reconditioned coffee machine .
if you can see this orange tree , it 's actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
it serves 220 people a day .
three compost bins — go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week — really good , makes fantastic compost .
`` and i tried taking the dried food waste , putting it to the worms , going , `` '' there you go , dinner . '' '' it was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them . ''
and i ultimately want to recycle that , put it back into the loos , maybe wash hands with it , i do n't know .
the air handling system inside it — i got rid of air-conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there .
i mean , the whole thing is is super-sustainable .
in fact , i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world .
in fact , sainsbury 's , if you 're watching , let 's have a go . try it on .
environmentally conscious businesses are doable .
i was n't very good at reading things .
but instead , i go out and i find things .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
the appearance of them would have been different — which it is in all social animals .
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex , one of the thigh bones , and she actually found some very interesting structures in there .
now it was n't dna ; she did n't find dna .
that was interesting .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when an animal is pregnant , when a bird is pregnant .
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs .
and we did . we got better material .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
we also have transgenesis .
and that 's pretty cool .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
this is a chicken with teeth .
that 's better than a glowing chicken .
he 's also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
birds have basically rudimentary tails .
`` now , i will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up . ( laughter ) why is it that the very word `` '' civics '' '' has such a soporific , even a narcoleptic effect on us ? ''
this is what i want to talk about today , and i want to start by defining some terms and then i want to describe the scale of the problem i think we face and then suggest the ways that i believe cities can be the seat of the solution .
power has a negative moral valence .
it sounds machiavellian inherently .
and the problem we face today , here in america in particular , but all around the world , is that far too many people are profoundly illiterate in power — what it is , who has it , how it operates , how it flows , what part of it is visible , what part of it is not , why some people have it , why that 's compounded .
how does a bias become a policy ?
insidiously , just the way that stop-and-frisk , for instance , became over time a bureaucratic numbers game .
the thing is , though , most people are n't looking for and do n't want to see these realities .
if people do n't learn power , people do n't wake up , and if they do n't wake up , they get left out .
think about a problem in the common life of your city .
well now , recently , the machine has started to get involved in actual city politics , and they 've engineered the election of a former machine member , a young , pro-business recent graduate to the tuscaloosa city school board .
the localism of our time is networked powerfully .
our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work .
so share what you write , do you what you write , and then share what you do .
it propelled me to go on and to co-lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene , and in the intervening decades since then , there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on , what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases .
in fact , for thousands of human traits , a molecular basis that 's known for that , and for thousands of people , every day , there 's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease .
but maybe , if what we 're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention , maybe what we should be doing is studying those who do n't get sick .
they 're not going to help us .
`` now , some of you , i can see you putting your hands up going , `` '' uh , a little odd . ''
and astute clinicians tracked that down , and what they found was they were carrying mutations .
and in some ways , think of it as a decoder ring , a sort of resilience decoder ring that we 're going to try to build .
basically all we need is information .
i took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in england in 1650 .
and so , effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse , you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day .
and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story .
we have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
but in fact , what i would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level .
these are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
`` so they started to think , `` '' could we build a neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts ? '' '' and this is what they ended up coming with . ''
now , that 's a great idea , but what i 'd like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen .
this is a statue from oxford .
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that , in fact , almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab , in front of the microscope .
there are passages where you can read it , and you think you 're reading from a darwin textbook , from the period before he has this epiphany .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
so , in a sense , we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property , you know , building barricades , having secretive r & d labs , patenting everything that we have , so that those ideas will remain valuable , and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas , and the culture will be more innovative .
it 's october of 1957 , and sputnik has just launched , and we 're in laurel maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university .
and these two guys are named guier and weiffenbach .
it was right at 20 mhz , so you could pick it up really easily , because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax , basically .
we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this .
`` and they they start thinking , `` '' well gosh , you know , we 're noticing small little frequency variations here . ''
`` we could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling , if we do a little basic math here using the doppler effect . '' '' and then they played around with it a little bit more , and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties . ''
`` a couple weeks later their boss , frank mcclure , pulls them into the room and says , `` '' hey , you guys , i have to ask you something about that project you were working on . ''
when you build them right , they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of .
thank you very much .
well , i learned a lot of things about ballooning , especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones .
sand , water , all the equipment we do n't need anymore .
and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis .
this can be in spirituality .
throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction .
`` and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man , and i told him , `` '' hey , guy , do n't you think we 're good pilots up there ? ''
`` we fly twice the speed you predicted . '' '' and he told me , `` '' do n't do that . go down immediately in order to slow down . '' '' and i started to argue . i said , `` '' i 'm not going to do that . ''
so , we went down actually .
it 's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .
we took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane .
we landed with 40 kilos .
i just thought it 's a dream and i want to do it .
it takes too much energy . it will cost too much .
that 's for sure .
we have now 70 people in the team working on it .
this is the complete structure of the airplane .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
and what 's the goal now ?
this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible , when we have a team , when we have pioneering spirit , and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard .
and more and more , we 're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project , to talk about the symbol of it , invited by politicians , invited in energy forums , in order to show that it 's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies .
no , the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life , save energy , go to renewables .
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life , to get to the success that you wish to have , to get to the point that really belongs to you , with the potential you have , and the one you can really fulfill ?
so , let 's go for it , and i wish you an excellent adventure in the wings of the future . thank you .
so that 's the basis of the work .
all sorts of people .
afghanistan .
and with our colleagues , we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help make sure that the words are understood and actually create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region .
it meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election .
however , this work of reference is quite high-pitched .
the silent majority needs to know .
let 's help them have a voice .
you had to survive .
so as a rookie teacher , i created opportunity .
but we had to do it .
yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
but what if we get it right ?
well , we 're making school worth coming to every day .
he was 94 when this photograph was taken .
and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories , of human-lived experiences filled with ex-slaves .
it 's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum 's collection using facial recognition .
so this person 's making different faces , and it 's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she 's looking .
so the memorial opened in 2011 , and the museum 's going to open next year in 2014 .
and of course the event itself is so recent , somewhere between history and current events , it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this , an event like this , to actually tell that story .
and when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world — this is obviously part of the landing gear — we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself , between the way that people were telling the stories of the event , and how we ourselves needed to tell that story .
`` and we got this amazing email that said , `` '' while viewing the thousands of photos on the site , i unexpectedly found a photo of my son . ''
( multiple voices ) voice 7 : it was probably about 11 o'clock at night .
voice 10 : trying to frantically get to a radio .
my business partner told me to turn on the television .
voice 3 : and i knew when i saw that , people who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through .
jb : and so as people make their way out of the museum , reflecting on the experience , reflecting on their own thoughts of it , they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself , because they 've gone back up to grade , and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years .
`` and ramos told wald , according to witnesses , `` i 'm not going to leave you . '' ''
some battle oppressive governments .
`` after finishing his bedtime rituals , he looked at me and he asked a question : `` mommy , are we bad people ? '' ''
[ but now ] he was ready to tell .
`` `` '' two boys hit me today in school . ''
i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
they were just influenced by the adults around them .
a courageous woman , her name is najla hariri , she 's a saudi woman in the city of jeddah , she drove a car and she announced but she did n't record a video .
we wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day , june 17 , when women go out and drive .
arrested again , he was sent to detention for one day , and i was sent to jail .
i was n't sure why i was sent there , because i did n't face any charges in the interrogation .
`` i did n't break a law , and i kept my abaya — it 's a black cloak we wear in saudi arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off , but i was so sure of my innocence , i kept saying , `` no , i 'm leaving today . '' ''
`` i was like , `` '' we are the last country in the world where women do n't drive . '' '' so if you look at the map of the world , that only leaves two countries : saudi arabia , and the other society is the rest of the world . ''
`` `` manal al-sharif withdraws from the campaign . '' ''
but you learn lessons from these things that happen to you .
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
saudi arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women 's rights .
the shura council that 's appointed by the king , by royal decree of king abdullah , last year there were 30 women assigned to that council , like 20 percent .
so for me , it 's not about only these small steps .
`` a friend once asked me , she said , `` so when do you think this women driving will happen ? '' ''
i 'm a copy editor .
`` we put the diaeresis , the double dot , over the `` '' i '' '' in `` '' naïve . '' '' we impose house style . ''
ouch .
( laughter ) and it 's true — we get a lot of complaints about commas .
`` there may not be on the sign , but yes , that is new yorker style for `` '' jr. '' '' one wag wrote : [ `` '' please , could you expel , or , at least , restrain , the comma-maniac , on your editorial staff ? '' '' ] ( laughter ) ah , well . ''
`` in this case , those commas are well-placed , except that there should not be one between `` '' maniac '' '' and `` '' on . '' '' ( laughter ) also , if we must have commas around `` '' at least , '' '' we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase : `` ... — or , at least , restrain — '' perfect . ''
there were three things in it that i had to challenge .
`` the author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice : [ `` '' it will be just a minute . ''
two out of three is n't bad .
( laughter ) thank you .
i mean , you lose .
i mean , it is really very , very scary the abuse that dogs get .
so , we get in dog training this notion of dominances , or of the alpha dog . i 'm sure that you 've heard this .
this is insanity .
so the first stage in training is to teach the dog esl , english as a second language .
and that 's how we use the food lure in the hand , and we use food because we 're dealing with owners .
`` `` phoenix , come here , take this , and go to jamie , please . '' ''
we use the premack principle .
`` yes , we put `` '' sniff butt '' '' on queue . ''
so now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training .
it 's like , if i just sit , that 's my command .
and this , to me , is always what training is .
`` and i have a little sign on my fridge , and it says , `` because i 'm the daddy , that 's why . '' ''
this is a life-or-death thing .
`` so some things we have to let the dog know , `` you must n't do this . '' ''
i bet a lot of you do , right ?
the dog is actually euthanized now , but this was a dog i worked with for a while .
a lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen , so while i was there — this was on the fourth visit — we did a four and a half hour down-stay , with the dog on his mat .
you see , the punishment was working .
`` i mean , my all-time classic is another `` '' come here '' '' one . ''
you know , i puppy-train my child .
and when it happens , it 's bad , it 's nasty .
and this , i would say , is the biggest human foible that we have .
you know , calculus is wonderful .
your kids are easy to train .
please excuse me for sitting ; i 'm very old .
so let me show you a few objects .
now , it did n't take me any time .
i 've been looking at these things for so long .
`` so then if you try to ask questions : `` what 's the surface of a cauliflower ? '' ''
well , you measure and measure and measure .
what 's the length of the coastline of these lakes ?
you must do it differently .
we see mountains in the distance .
now a lung is something very strange .
the bronchi branch , branch , branch and they stop branching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical considerations : the mucus , which is in the lung .
and i think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these branching systems , for which there was no geometry .
and a surprising aspect of it is that very often , the rules of this geometry are extremely short .
and well , it 's a story unto itself .
this is a mess , mess , mess , brownian loop .
one day i decided — halfway through my career , i was held by so many things in my work — i decided to test myself .
well , so i looked at these things called brownian motion — just goes around .
`` i see ; it 's an island . '' '' and amazing . ''
`` now everybody asks me at one point or another , `` '' how did it all start ? ''
if you master these , you master price , and if you do n't master these , you can master the little noise as well as you can , but it 's not important .
well , here are the curves for it .
since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a week , i had very big dreams .
and after the war , i saw an uncle again .
it 's so uninteresting .
shapes which are of such complication , such harmony and such beauty .
and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that , and others it is that or that .
to receive a prize from the university , and three days later , a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing .
i 'm a little bit of an amateur historian , so i 've spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
before we think about where we go from here .
i 'm not going to present all the data that i have here today , but let me just give you a few data points .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
or think of investment . take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
if you raise questions about that formulation , you really are considered a bit of an antique .
it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world , which is a little bit surprising when you think about it .
when you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives .
but fortunately , it also works the other way around .
if you can reduce traffic even somewhat , then congestion will go down much faster than you might think .
but you see , there 's an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007 .
but it was fun anyway .
which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent , and reduced congestion by enormous numbers , and people are n't even aware that they have changed , and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along .
you should just nudge them in the right direction .
the intensity of the upspring .
yemenis are using cartoons and art , paintings , comics , to tell the world and each other about what 's going on .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
then you would know that there 's so much to it .
he would say we are equal .
pm : i do n't think so . ( laughter ) na : but it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society .
`` and it 's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , `` '' i am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . '' '' and the more empowered the women become , the more they are able to remove the veil , for example , or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel . ''
na : well the yemen times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
we 've created the credibility .
( laughter ) that thing . ( pm : rap . break dancing . ) yeah , break dancing .
but after the two years , which is a price we are willing to pay , we are going to stand up again on our feet , but in the new yemen with a younger and more empowered people — democratic .
yementimes.com .
but most kids do n't hear about people like this .
and so you might feel alone .
you might feel like you do n't have a purpose .
thank you .
in a city where this should n't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
but then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell .
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
it has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians .
the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities , such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by , a series of commercial [ spaces ] that bring activity to the ground floor .
for this reason , i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people .
climate models in the 2010s , kind of what we 're working with now , four orders of magnitude .
we no longer use punch cards .
new-fangled ideas like c really have n't had a big impact on the climate modeling community .
changes in biomass burning , in smoke , in aerosol particles , all of those things change the climate .
they 're always approximations .
the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols , small particles , into the stratosphere .
i could go through a dozen more examples : the skill associated with solar cycles , changing the ozone in the stratosphere ; the skill associated with orbital changes over 6,000 years .
we can look at that too , and the models are skillful .
how do air pollution and climate coexist ?
can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time ?
what was common to us all 40 years ago — the telling of stories between generations — is now rarified .
in the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the u.k. , with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes .
`` in a filmclub season about democracy and government , we screened `` '' mr. smith goes to washington . '' '' made in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members ' grandparents . ''
from 25 clubs , we became hundreds , then thousands , until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country .
`` `` '' persepolis '' '' brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother , and `` '' jaws '' '' became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey . ''
what would they do under the same conditions ?
how has the world changed ? how could it be different ?
`` agree that `` '' boyz n the hood , '' '' like tennyson , offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together . ''
we guessed that film , whose stories are a meeting place of drama , music , literature and human experience , would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub .
89 percent of these people voted for mccain .
so vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time , what we can focus on , is actually relatively small .
but we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see , and it 's our mind that helps us fill in that gap .
again , we gathered objective measurements of people 's physical fitness , measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips , and we had them do a few other tests of fitness .
so our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks , but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier .
it 's an actual directive for how to look around your environment .
you will notice the finish line , but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right , or the people and the lamp post off to the left .
so what did we find ?
so i can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me .
so we all see the world through our own mind 's eye , and on some days , it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place , but it does n't have to look that way all the time .
he 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . ( laughter ) it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it was n't what you see on tv .
contrary to what most people think , people do n't pay , taxpayers do n't pay , for your life when you 're in prison . you 've got to pay for your own life .
so what did i learn ? well , here i am inside biosphere 2 , making a pizza .
so we had our own miniature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef .
back then , yes , i guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth , right ?
well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one .
this is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of biosphere 2 that we called our test module .
it was essentially an organic farm .
( laughter ) and those sweet potatoes became part of me .
in fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato .
and we knew that we were losing co2 .
and one day he could n't add up a line of figures .
essentially it had done something very simple .
and everybody ran up to me .
we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff .
i did n't even recognize half the names in most of the food that i was eating .
in biosphere 2 i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very viscerally , very literally .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
it is so dry .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
so they 're all shitting each other 's ponds , quite literally .
in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea .
`` they go , `` '' but how can i possibly find my way in that ? ''
we 're very uncomfortable with untidiness .
i 've been building topsoil .
the industrial revolution — and prometheus — has given us this , the ability to light up the world .
`` and that it was n't until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , `` the strategy , the leadership and the resources . '' ''
in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .
we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million afghans had mobile telephones .
he was very generous , like many of the afghans i stayed with .
it 's not ; it 's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
but it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it .
these are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making afghanistan less secure , not more secure — that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
they 're worried , in other words , that if anybody believes that it was n't such a threat — oxfam , save the children would n't get the money to build their hospitals and schools .
well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like michael semple , or those other people , who are telling the truth , who know the country , who 've spent 30 years on the ground — and most importantly of all , the missing component of this — afghans themselves , who understand what is going on .
and thirdly , we need to have some humility .
the crime rates in bosnia today are lower than they are in sweden .
and finally , we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility — was the tentative nature of our engagement .
because if what we 're interested in is terrorism , pakistan is far more important than afghanistan .
thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . thank you . thank you very much .
we could have done that .
once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
and this is , today , the first time in any sort of public setting i 've ever acknowledged the journey that i have been on .
we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what 's authentic in an airstream trailer , and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .
that trailer led to another commission , to participate in whats called tokyo designers block .
teruo kurosaki , who owns a furniture company called idee , he asked me to ship him two trailers to tokyo .
he said one he would like to make a real trailer , functioning , and we would sell that one .
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream .
`` they came to me and said , `` '' well , what can we do to freshen this thing up ? ''
`` i thought , `` '' finally , oh yeah great , big company , i 'm gon na work with somebody with money for tooling and molding . '' '' and i walked in their prototype facility , and it 's exactly like my shop , only bigger — same tools , same things . ''
so the problem became — and they set this dilemma to me — that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there 's no money for tooling or molding .
it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission , to tell the drone where to go .
now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone , but they are even more surprised when i tell them how affordable these components are .
so now that you 've built your own conservation drone , you probably want to go fly it , but how does one fly a drone ?
now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest .
now as you can imagine , that is a very time-consuming , labor-intensive , and costly process , so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in indonesia and elsewhere in southeast asia .
this is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree , seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead , not once but several times .
but besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves , we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in , because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats .
now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world , so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in southeast asia .
recently , we 've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras .
we brought a few of these to indonesia for the first few test flights .
they transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape .
he was interested in productivity — i think it 's something that concerns all of us — but it 's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs .
well , all but three were dead .
this is measured by something called the reading the mind in the eyes test .
but there is n't a single high-tech company i 've worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue , because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other .
the term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress .
not a bad return on social capital , which compounds even as you spend it .
`` it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . '' '' and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity , i could n't even see any superstars , because everybody there really mattered . ''
for decades , we 've tried to motivate people with money , even though we 've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness .
the first was the head of engineering , frank maslen , said , there will be no stars in this team .
second , we work to one standard only : the best imaginable .
thank you .
i learned how to dance in heels , which means i can walk in heels .
and when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the jersey shore , i did not .
( laughter ) so as you 're thinking of that , let 's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate does n't become a tupperware salesman . ( laughter )
and this is not something new .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
so we think it 's perfectly normal and natural to change it .
but if you can save them and you can freeze them , and you can have a surrogate mother , it means that you 've decoupled sex from time .
this is stuff we take for granted today .
let 's have some risks .
and that scares a lot of people .
you do n't usually give your loved one wildflowers because they do n't last a whole lot of time .
so let me explain these things .
it 's the same with a wheat field , it 's the same with a rice field .
a non-random mutation is beer .
it 's wine . it 's yogurt .
it really is a superpower .
this is what we are doing , what we are choosing .
principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
( applause )
the trouble is we 're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet , a quadruple sqeeze , which , as its first squeeze , has population growth of course .
now , this is not only about numbers ; this is not only about the fact that we 're seven billion people committed to nine billion people , it 's an equity issue as well .
now , as a scientist , what 's the evidence for this ?
it 's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change .
and i can tell you , you enter the disciplinary research in each of these , you find something remarkably important , the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves , that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet , the decade when we have to bend the curves .
are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we 're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired , if now catastrophic , change for human development ?
you know , you do n't want to stand there .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quantified boundaries , as suggested by this analysis .
well , there 's no science to suggest .
the drama is , of course , is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction .
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
and what shall we do ?
so there is — no doubt — opportunity here , and we can list many , many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet .
`` the key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead backcast our future , and we say , `` '' what is the playing field on the planet ? ''
`` `` '' and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out . ''
patents are very difficult to overturn .
secondly , make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money .
what we found is quite remarkable .
it was a historical day .
bubbles of vapor form inside the water , then they expand , turning liquid into gas .
in principle , you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach , and yet , the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30 , 35 degrees .
as a result , the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value , near to collapse .
from this , we discovered that the higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge , ready for cosmic collapse , and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach , the multiverse .
but i do n't know if my hypothesis is right .
thank you .
`` we say , `` '' hello , how are you ? ''
they have no semantic meaning .
so he 's wearing , like , a long overcoat and sort of an old-man hat , and he looked like somebody from a movie .
`` `` no , it 's just good to be friendly . '' ''
i think twice every time i say that to her , because i mean it , but as a woman , particularly , i know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions .
categories are something our brains use .
it 's quick , it 's easy and it 's a road to bias .
and it means we 're not thinking about people as individuals .
she 's entering into towns and cities as a complete stranger .
she has no bonds , no connections .
the first one is that it 's a quick interaction .
they 'll glance at each other from a distance .
that 's the civility , the acknowledgment .
in other cultures , people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all .
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water .
you might have that experience i talked about of feeling understood .
always in those moments , they share their own experiences of loss .
so , here it is .
when you talk to strangers , you 're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life and theirs .
we spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers .
we could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other .
let me read you the entry .
`` `` '' disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak . ''
and dr. p always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt .
there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
we can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
now , who 's normal ?
there 's common , there 's typical . there 's no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
`` i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , `` '' well , if it is n't aimee mullins . '' '' and i turn around , and it 's this older man . i have no idea who he is . ''
this man was dr. kean , a man that i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
`` and dr. kean went on to tell me , he said , `` '' in my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . '' '' see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking . ''
he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
`` well , they took , over a three-month period , d-level students , gave them a 's , told them they were `` '' a 's , '' '' told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at a-level . ''
`` they were simply told , `` '' these are the 'a-students , ' these are the 'd-students . ' '' '' and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them . ''
and we began to think : what if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the new york times ?
just looking at these is fascinating .
of course , it varies by profession .
famous people — prince , ali , zaha hadid — people who are not famous are people like jocelyn cooper , reverend curry or lorna kelly .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
`` these kids on the internet , they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like `` '' barrel roll . '' '' it 's a video game move from `` '' star fox . '' '' `` `` star fox 20 '' '' ? ( assistant : `` '' star fox 64 . '' '' ) tom green : yeah . and they 've been dogging me for a year . ''
and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the macy 's thanksgiving day parade , and rick astley pops out , and rickrolls millions of people on television .
so does a site like this have rules ?
rule one is you do n't talk about /b/ .
i assure you , it is very true .
anonymous is this group of people that protested , very famously , scientology .
( laughter ) so we 've got this activist group that 's this grassroots group that 's come out of the site .
within 24 hours , they had his name , and within 48 hours , he was arrested .
( applause ) and so , what i think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it 's this open place .
but anonymity basically allows people to say anything , all the rules gone .
you 've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
and i 'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you 've opened pandora 's box .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
ca : that 's very cool .
( laughter ) ca : and so , in 10 years ' time , what do you picture yourself doing ?
it was easier . it was cheaper .
and we call this typical .
but i must warn you : this is not easy .
it 's changing our relationship to the health care system .
this is about personalized , individualized health care for everyone .
thank you .
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
it felt wrong to do that in some way .
and yet , i do n't really think it is because when it comes down to it , it 's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain — what people in the future are going to remember about this period .
the reason for that is really very simple .
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
you just have to look at the human genome project .
`` and we 've all seen `` '' 2001 : a space odyssey . '' '' you know it 's 2003 , and there is no hal . ''
it 's changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .
and how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
and it 's going to be used for diet as well , and nutritional supplements and such .
the approval process is going to fall apart , actually .
and if you do n't , who are you going to be ?
the idea that we 're going to chose our children 's genes , as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are .
and when it does it 's not going to be that big a deal .
you take a six to eight cell embryo , you tease out one of the cells , you run a genetic test on that cell , and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it .
and it wo n't be done .
but ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere .
in fact this is n't just abstract .
and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
we are , definitely .
a few had good grades .
and this applies for everything . even in sales .
i end with — the koreans did this .
and we need to learn that principle here in the states , because we have a big debt .
we are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
`` we came here saying we want to talk about `` '' africa : the next chapter . '' '' but we are talking about `` '' africa : the next chapter '' '' because we are looking at the old and the present chapter — that we 're looking at , and saying it 's not such a good thing . ''
and i think it 's worth remembering what we 've heard through the conference right from the first day , where i heard that all the important statistics have been given — about where we are now , about how the continent is doing much better .
you know , as you can see , from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion .
in 2005 , remittances — i just took one country , nigeria skyrocketing — skyrocketing is too dramatic , but increasing dramatically .
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy .
so now we have this platform we can build on .
and that 's not what the debate should be about .
so i 'm afraid we 've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .
is it being directed effectively ?
from 1967 to '70 , nigeria fought a war — the nigeria-biafra war .
we spent much of our time with my mother cooking .
we were on the biafran side .
people , children were dying of kwashiorkor .
he was in the army .
by the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving .
and then they toweled her down because she started sweating , which was a good sign .
i strapped her on my back .
however , i will also tell you that i 'm one of those who does n't believe that this is the sole answer .
they are just discovering .
are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money ? are we there ?
and each one is making their own individual effort .
that education will work better if we 've got electricity and railroads , and so on .
but it can be catalytic . and if we fail to use it as catalytic , we would have failed .
why ca n't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms , to enable people to take risk ?
but i want you to realize that resources in the hands of african women is a powerful tool .
similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
the sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992 .
i had the endorsement from the new york daily news , the wall street journal snapped pictures of me on election day , and cnbc called it one of the hottest races in the country .
but on election day , the polls were right , and i only got 19 percent of the vote , and the same papers that said i was a rising political star now said i wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes .
it 's often said in silicon valley , no one even takes you seriously unless you 've had two failed start-ups .
in other words , we 're raising our girls to be perfect , and we 're raising our boys to be brave .
well , at the fifth grade level , girls routinely outperform boys in every subject , including math and science , so it 's not a question of ability .
perfection or bust .
we have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection , but we 've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone .
these are just three examples of thousands , thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect , who have learned to keep trying , who have learned perseverance .
thank you .
( applause ) and that number is really powerful , because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science .
we own the internet , and we should be building the companies of tomorrow .
each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .
i 'm talking about your language , of course , because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else 's mind , and they can attempt to do the same to you , without either of you having to perform surgery .
but if we look at the fossil record , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years .
now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived , what their generation time was , that 's about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring , and other individuals watching , in which that hand axe did n't change .
it 's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives , the neanderthals , had social learning .
`` okay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old adage , `` monkey see , monkey do , '' the surprise really is that all of the other animals really can not do that — at least not very much . ''
and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it — something from a barnum & bailey circus .
we can build on their wisdom .
`` in fact , we can even make the `` '' stuff of life '' '' — as i just said , all the stuff around us . ''
but in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story .
just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
`` the other one says , `` '' fine . looks good to me . ''
and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , languishing .
that 's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites .
and this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to , with social learning and language , we could transform the environment to suit our needs .
if we go to the island of papua new guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone .
our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
and nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the european union , whose 27 member countries speak 23 official languages .
there are many , many ways of imprinting cds or dvds , but those are all being standardized as well .
thank you .
svante found that the foxp2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in neanderthals as us .
do we have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if they also had language ?
mark pagel : this is a very good question .
now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
bushmeat trades and forest loss means we could n't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world — and we 're not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees .
( laughter ) play 's a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious — maybe where wonder is discovered anew .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
the 404 page is that .
but these things are everywhere .
they 're on sites big , they 're on sites small .
you get that , and it 's like a slap in the face .
trying to think about how a 404 felt , and it would be like if you went to starbucks and there 's the guy behind the counter and you 're over there and there 's no skim milk .
they took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so this turned into a contest .
dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
this is a photograph of a man whom for many years i plotted to kill .
but come the day , he would always skip that loose step , he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat .
and so for many years , i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him .
`` and at times , when we were like this , so much `` '' shhh , '' '' so much `` '' shhh '' '' going on in the house that i imagined us to be like the german crew of a u-boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above , on the surface , hms bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance . ''
and this was the 1970s , it was luton , where he worked at vauxhall motors , and he was a jamaican .
and what he meant was , you as a child of a jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn , to see whether you conform to the host nation 's stereotype of you , of being feckless , work-shy , destined for a life of crime .
they clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them .
they shape their lives according to the narrative of your life , as i did with my father and my mother , perhaps , and maybe bageye did with his father .
my father aspired to have a car like that , but my father had a beaten-up mini , and he never , being a jamaican coming to this country , he never had a driving license , he never had any insurance or road tax or mot .
they leave their homes . my father and my mother left jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles , and yet they were infantilized by travel .
and also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
having started the process , my father did not continue .
`` but such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety , so much so that years later , when i was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia , six times more than they ought to be , i was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say , `` black people are schooled in paranoia . '' ''
and i wonder what bageye would make of that .
but i welcomed that title , and i thought actually , yes , there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we 'd never had before .
bageye was stung by what he perceived to be the public airing of his shortcomings .
but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy .
what if i told you that the two-meter positioning that our current cell phones and our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting ?
`` do you remember the movie `` '' the da vinci code ? '' '' here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot , which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe , but we know that in the world of nonfiction , the gps dot is impossible , right ? ''
there 's been a strong trend toward miniaturization , better sensitivity , so much so that , a few years ago , a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys .
compare that with the device released just months ago that 's now packaged into something the size of a key fob , and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver , which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever , you realize that the gps dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction .
i could n't find my shoes one recent morning , and , as usual , had to ask my wife if she had seen them .
( laughter ) those of you who have made the switch to gmail , remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it .
well , so did i .
`` `` i 've talked to them too , and same story . '' ''
its jamming signals do n't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car .
all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank , and now it 's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it .
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack .
people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one .
i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo .
they seemed to speak to me .
you 'll never lose track of your things again .
the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life .
science .
`` that was really the `` '' what '' '' of science . ''
it was the history of what other people had discovered .
so the prediction test failed .
the caduceus , or the symbol of medicine , means a lot of different things to different people , but most of our public discourse on medicine really turns it into an engineering problem .
these are all good things .
medicine is science .
and you may remember from those boring days in biology class that populations tend to distribute around a mean as a gaussian or a normal curve .
therefore , in medicine , after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation , we test it in a population .
there is no surgery i have ever performed for a sarcoma patient that has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial , what we consider the best kind of population-based evidence in medicine .
we often talk about losing the forests for the trees , but one also loses a tree within a forest .
that src is the most frequently turned on oncogene in all of cancer .
but it was the first oncogene .
but we did n't learn about it from common cancers .
i have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases .
what are the experiments that are being done ?
she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes .
`` i 'm going to keep my baby safe . '' '' i did n't tell her . ''
i did n't tell her .
i did n't fill in that blank .
i do n't have sarcoma .
a colleague of mine removed a tumor from a patient 's limb .
this is what i 'm going to watch for .
`` and we 're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work to get rid of your cancer . '' '' i can guarantee you , she and her husband did not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me . ''
so please , join the conversation .
thank you .
we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now — from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
but that 's actually not what i 'm here to talk about .
what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at ?
and we have a small team who is working on this .
take the crowd and apply them to the information .
so , thank you very much .
and we are very happy to be part of the ted family .
she went back not just once , but twice more .
specifically , about your housing conditions ?
do you have mold ? do you have water leaks ?
it comes from chronically rubbing one 's nose up and down , trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms , and yet , here was veronica , a grown woman , with the same telltale sign of allergies .
`` i think you have chronic allergies , and i think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion , and i think all of those are related to where you live . '' '' she looked a little bit relieved , because for the first time , she had a diagnosis , but i said , `` '' veronica , now let 's talk about your treatment . ''
veronica had improved remarkably .
`` it 's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease . '' '' now , you might be likely to invest if that product was a drug or a device , but what if that product was a park ? ''
`` i went back and forth , i saw all sorts of people in healthcare , and no one asked about my home . '' '' the honest answer is that in healthcare , we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place . ''
and there are many reasons for that , but the big three are first , we do n't pay for that .
it 's one , two and three .
and perhaps that 's what we should mobilize our resources to address , because that third element , that third part of the process , is that next critical part of what upstreamists do .
they mobilize the resources to create a solution , both within the clinical system , and then by bringing in people from public health , from other sectors , lawyers , whoever is willing to play ball , let 's bring in to create a solution that makes sense , to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need .
but we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now , by all accounts , and that 's why , a few years ago , my colleagues and i said , you know what , we need to train and make more upstreamists .
medical schools , nursing schools , all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists .
and what can we do together to improve my health where it begins ?
thank you .
a hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of nato forces in the country , for a couple months .
it was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment .
they slept in the same clothes .
there was no internet . there was no phone .
combat they did learn to like .
`` stripped to the waist , walked past me muttering , `` oh god , please someone attack us today . '' ''
first of all , the experience is very bizarre , it 's a very bizarre one .
you notice some details very , very , very accurately and other things drop out .
it 's wired into us .
the mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents , just the stupid stuff that young men do : jumping off of things they should n't jump off of , lighting things on fire they should n't light on fire , i mean , you know what i 'm talking about .
so i had some sand sprayed in the side of my face .
it was machine gun fire .
just think about the math on that .
they got back .
`` he remembers people saying , as he was sort of half-conscious , he remembers people saying , `` steiner 's been hit in the head . steiner 's dead . '' ''
on the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words , what i did was , i asked bill and melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they 've done , and do a few things that way .
we married a few months later , and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna .
it was incredible . bill had never taken that much time off from work .
so that was our global thing , and then in the u.s. , both of us have had amazing educations , and we saw that as the way that the u.s .
and so we picked those two things , and everything the foundation does is focused there .
ca : so , i asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work , and melinda , this is what you picked .
what 's this about ?
mg : so i , one of the things i love to do when i travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women , whether it 's bangladesh , india , lots of countries in africa , and i go in as a western woman without a name .
`` and i kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more i traveled , `` i want to be able to use this shot . '' ''
which is an injection they were getting called depo-provera , which is a contraceptive .
because of all the aids work that the u.s .
we knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives , even the contraceptives we have here in the united states , and we were n't providing them because of the political controversy in our country , and to me that was just a crime , and i kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage , and i finally realized i just had to do it .
and even though i 'm catholic , i believe in contraceptives just like most of the catholic women in the united states who report using contraceptives , and i should n't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back .
does that drive you crazy ?
bg : yeah , because it 's a silent thing going on .
we can spend aid smarter .
it is not all a panacea .
ca : so , in vaccines and polio and so forth , you 've had some amazing successes .
but the thing that we learned from that work , and what turned out to be the fundamental key , is a great teacher in front of the classroom .
jenn 's been to tanzania .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were twins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named grace .
ca : i mean , this is another pic of your other two kids , rory and phoebe , along with paul farmer .
we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
ca : well , speaking of warren buffett , something really amazing happened in 2006 , when somehow your only real rival for richest person in america suddenly turned around and agreed to give 80 percent of his fortune to your foundation .
how on earth did that happen ?
ca : and since this relationship , it 's amazing— ( applause ) and recently , you and warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give , what , more than half of their assets for philanthropy .
the thing that 's great is that we get together yearly and talk about , okay , do you hire staff , what do you give to them ?
we 're not trying to homogenize it .
bg : that 's the most important .
`` the answer — the short answer to all those questions is , `` '' yes . '' '' yes , i 'm afraid of all those things . ''
an extraordinary statement to make about your life 's work .
which is — you know , like check it out , i 'm pretty young , i 'm only about 40 years old .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
( laughter ) so when i heard that i was like — that 's uncanny , that 's exactly what my creative process is like . ( laughter )
and for me , the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
do n't be daunted . just do your job .
i 'm from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
yeah , i kind of felt sorry for him .
so i decided to give him a little support , and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other .
the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture — the whole thing is unstructured .
( laughter ) we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original : 17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares .
`` `` laut den kunstprüfer dr. albrecht — '' it 's not finished yet . ''
i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway .
that 's a picture by keith haring .
in the end , one has a list with which one then can arrange .
it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels .
`` and you know , there you had this little sign — i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read , `` '' please tidy room . '' '' i do n't know if you have them over here . ''
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few things around the space .
ok , i mean , i can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture has n't been properly tidied up . so we can make a short test with you .
some people would make apple pie out of it .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
( laughter ) but yeah , and it 's great , you can even go , you know — or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art .
so i 'm — yeah , actually i 'm kind of finished at that moment .
yeah , i think , after you have seen that i have to leave anyway .
and she 's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do , a kind of teetering , my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way .
because apparently we do n't .
it 's sunday night .
this always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive .
`` the second is media and celebrity culture , then how to handle teasing and bullying , the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks , talking about appearance — some people call this `` '' body talk '' '' or `` '' fat talk '' '' — and finally , the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself . ''
an education is critical , but tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives .
it is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts , or to infer that the determination or the success of an olympian is down to her not being a looker .
we need to start judging people by what they do , not what they look like .
a world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves , where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life .
your niece ?
let 's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
and the table form is important , and since it 's touch-interactive , just like the way they do dissections in the lab , or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table .
and i can change my cut to see different parts .
ok , i 'm going to do another cut .
all right then .
so this is anatomage table . thank you .
now we 'll explain that in a second .
let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance .
i can also make him spin .
he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas .
this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero .
and these are more practical applications .
70 meters .
learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly .
and the fax was the tool of my activism .
new power works like a current .
new power values of informal , networked governance .
and in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is : how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized ?
and yet , when you look at the phenotypes , there 's a chimp , there 's a man ; they 're astoundingly different , no resemblance at all .
if we changed so much , something must have happened .
that explained everything .
what do you do ? what does a scientist do in that case ?
`` it had been waiting there since 1960 when alister hardy , a marine biologist , said , `` '' i think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . '' '' he kept it to himself for 30 years . ''
i mean , look at the elephant .
but by now , everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor .
the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros .
here you ca n't find anybody to compare it with , because we 're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .
there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water .
do you think that 's significant ?
in the whale it 's complete : no fat inside at all , all in blubber outside .
the question of why we can speak .
`` you ca n't even train a gorilla to say `` '' ah '' '' on request . ''
they are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum .
ultimately one of three things is going to happen .
that would be a beautiful thing .
`` they decided in 1960 , `` that belongs with the ufos and the yetis . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) he says , `` '' firstly , you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it 's been trained to receive . '' '' right . i 'll go ahead with that . ''
i 'll go along with that too .
and when noah had done built his ark ...
i was n't good enough ; i was n't smart enough .
thank you .
i come from colorado .
( laughter ) my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph , but after six months , i could n't walk up a small hill . i could n't climb a flight of stairs .
i could barely stand up without feeling like i was going to faint .
if you go through a metal detector , you 'll probably die .
no one wants to go on flolan .
within a few weeks , i was performing , and in a few months , i debuted at the kennedy center .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
at 24 , my death would have been entirely expected .
i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face , and in the heat of the desert , i was freezing cold .
i started mixing , and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another , but i just kept on going .
i went back to the states , anticipating i 'd return to europe , but the heart catheterization showed that i was n't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant .
`` a happy patient is a healthy patient . '' '' it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and confucius . ''
the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket , telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again , and to please try and save my voice .
you could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it .
there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body .
i could n't walk , i could n't talk , i could n't eat , i could n't move , i certainly could n't sing , i could n't even breathe , but when i looked up and i saw my mother , i could n't help but smile .
medical conditions do n't negate the human condition .
my parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place , but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time .
and i wanted to tell her , and i want to tell you , we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams .
( applause ) [ singing : french ] thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a , t , c and g .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world , in many places , and they tend to vary as gradients , from a bird's-eye perspective at least .
they 've sequenced 185 africans from two populations in africa .
and we can begin to say how much variance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences .
so we can relax the criterion a bit and say : how many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in africa have one variant , 95 percent another variant , and the number of that is 12 .
they are what we just said — facial features , hair structure , skin color .
so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
there were other forms of humans around , most famously perhaps , neanderthals — these robust forms of humans , compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right — that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years .
presumably , they did so first in the middle east , where there were neanderthals living .
and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains at a place called denisova , a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone — this is a copy of it — that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
so we can then ask for denisovans the same things as for the neanderthals : did they mix with ancestors of present day people ?
presumably , modern humans emerged somewhere in africa .
and since we mixed elsewhere , i 'm pretty sure that one day , when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa , we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa .
we mixed with these earlier forms of humans , wherever we met them , and we mixed with each other ever since .
we built the hardware and the software .
in fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people did n't even notice .
what ?
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
do you realize that you , ted users , spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic , wasting your time on your daily commute ?
thank you .
( applause )
that is the message , which we started 31 years ago .
and what did it start ?
these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network : that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .
we are talking about an accountable society , a society that is fair and just , and we do n't even do justice in the knowledge market .
it must be the same .
you can not discriminate .
pardon ? ( audience member : rajasthan . ) anil gupta : but what has it been used for ? what has it been used for ?
the rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture , millions of them , every season , in the paddy season , when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .
and feet in the water will develop fungus , infections , and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point .
there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .
look at this lady , ram timari devi , on a grain bin . in champaran , we had a shodh yatra and we were walking in the land where gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy , pain of indigo growers .
( applause ) look at what rojadeen has done .
a lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .
somebody from india would know , of course .
now , let me mention one thing : i think we need a polycentric model of development , where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country , in different parts of the world , would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner .
my technology .
this innovation is from the slums of rio .
assam , kanak gogoi .
and you would not find this car in u.s. or europe , but this is available in india .
in one day , 18,000 times , she had to do this winding to generate two sarees .
so , i went yesterday , i apologize , i skipped a few of the talks , and i went over to the national academy of sciences building , and they sell toys , giant microbes .
i got ta get back out my baseball ability here .
( laughter ) so , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens .
and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is , what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular , to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us .
i gave a talk , and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk , and came up to me afterwards saying , they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people .
they did this because this was common practice in medicine , even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea .
and excessive use of antibiotics , in particular in children , has been shown to be associated with , again , risk factors for obesity , for autoimmune diseases , for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community .
i 'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics .
most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them , maybe five species in them , and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species .
so what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us ?
studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this , but people are now using these technologies because they 've gotten very cheap , to study the microbes in and on a variety of people .
( laughter ) but the reason i 'm telling you this is that the medical community , my father as an example , sometimes does n't see what 's right in front of their eyes .
the microbial cloud , it is right in front of us .
they 're microbes . they 're tiny .
what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people , so that we can understand what they 're doing to our lives .
when i was born , this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the fry brothers and lars leksell , who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife .
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .
but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .
the temperature was raised to 43 degrees c temporarily .
so once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen , then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .
and this is a quote from john after he wrote it .
and john today is fully independent .
he suffers from no neurodeficit .
and again , he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide , also in the u.s .
he had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful .
and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens .
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
but i have now a message to the ladies .
and sometimes , they can not even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid .
( applause )
to which i usually respond , i do computer music .
and i 'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition , maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff i 've been working on .
now , chuck is a programming language for music , and it 's open-source , it 's freely available , and i like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems .
this is , to me , the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they 're thinking really hard .
now the laptop orchestra is an ensemble of laptops , humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays .
in fact , i 'm going to show you how we actually built them .
this is an 11-inch blanda matt .
well , let me give you a demonstration of about 200 instruments we 've created so far for the laptop orchestra .
and what i 'm going to do is actually come over to this thing .
it 's tethered to the base , and this will track the position of your hands in real time .
`` that turned out to be a rather large commercial non-success , at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars , at which point computer music researchers said , `` '' this is awesome ! ''
so ocarina — ( music ) — is based on this ancient flute-like instrument called the ocarina , and this one is the four-hole english pendant configuration , and you 're literally blowing into the microphone to make the sound .
if you have n't seen one , it 's probably because you did n't know what to look for — they 're everywhere .
did you know this was happening ?
this document from the federal drug enforcement administration , which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this , is one of several that reveal the existence of this database .
the question is , what should we do about this ?
thank you .
it 's during our lifetime that we 're going to take the earth , take the people of earth and transition off , permanently . and that 's exciting .
you know , it 's the first time that we 're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy , a chance to , if you would , back up the biosphere .
and if you think about space , everything we hold of value on this planet — metals and minerals and real estate and energy — is in infinite quantities in space .
it drove us to the moon . we — literally in fear — with the soviet union raced to the moon . and we have these huge rocks , you know , killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there , and while the probability is very small , the impact , figured in literally , of one of these hitting the earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking , searching , preparing to defend , is not unreasonable .
my plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market , and then actually claim that i 'm going to go out and get one .
and that will fund the actual mission to go and get one .
that 's a pathetic number . it 's unreasonable .
the difficulty is getting there , and clearly , the cost to orbit is key .
one of the companies i started , space adventures , will sell you a ticket .
you know , one — we have a very unique period in time today .
12 to 15 launches per year .
it 's people . the ansari x prize was my solution , reading about lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there .
i had the pleasure of borrowing from the longitude prize and the orteig prize that put lindbergh forward .
you know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you 're going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
someone 's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing .
and the way we 're doing that is we 're creating prize teams within the x prize . we have a space prize team .
we 're going after an orbital prize .
`` he said , `` '' i have a dream . '' '' and i have a dream . ''
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
a deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away .
okay , they think money is slightly important .
and we created , at the organization that i work for , the new economics foundation , something we call the happy planet index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
why do n't we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
but we have to remember that there 's a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet 's resources we use .
and this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .
they are the u.s.a. , other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually .
the average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
it might be latin american .
and i put it to you , that is not business as usual .
none of us , i think , want human progress to stop .
did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
what are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ?
and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .
a way that is perhaps more real , more honest .
this is an image from tuscany , where we feel agriculture is still about beauty .
and this is about good taste , good traditions .
in the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved , most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production .
and even sort of horrible things , like picking beans by hand , can now be done automatically .
that is the reality of our modern life .
now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades , since the 1960s , food availability , per head , in this world , has increased by 25 percent .
and it frees us all up to do other things — to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food .
never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people .
so as food became more plentiful , bread became cheaper .
so we must find other solutions .
yes . but we need mechanization .
so what kind of science can we have ?
use biotechnology where useful , particularly in pest and disease resistance .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
we need to help to lift them out of poverty .
and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap .
who said this so beautifully was mahatma gandhi , 75 years ago , when he spoke about bread .
`` he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , `` '' to those who have to go without two meals a day , god can only appear as bread . '' '' and so as i 'm finishing my bread here — and i 've been baking it , and i 'll try not to burn my hands . ''
( applause )
i think of our architecture as organizational structures .
this is the headquarters for china 's national broadcaster , which i designed together with rem koolhaas at oma .
and suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance , but as an organism , as a life form .
and of course , we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system , to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity .
but of course , it 's not a number , it is the people , it is a community that inhabits the building , and in order to both comprehend this , but also script this architecture , we identified five characters , hypothetical characters , and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building , thought of where they would meet , what they would experience .
and this is how the building stands in beijing today .
and they 're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building .
this is , in fact , the 13th floor of one of these terraces .
we no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other .
so institutions could shrink or contract , as , of course , the future of culture is , in a way , the most uncertain of all .
( applause )
`` today we made a big step forward . '' '' so this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries . ''
so in 1900 , as you can see , we were well within the limits of safety .
now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries .
so what can we do in that situation ?
not only in humans .
and of course we are sometimes selfish , and some people more than others .
so do you need 50,000 hours of meditation ? no , you do n't .
even with preschoolers — richard davidson did that in madison .
so before the intervention , they give most of it to their best friend .
so now where do we go from there ?
and we need to dare altruism .
and first , i want to tell you about one of them .
this is 22-year-old mouaz al balkhi from syria .
so shadi and one of his sisters , they fled to libya .
tomm , you two have been back to calais recently .
management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff . ( laughter ) a recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm .
they can design for it . but how ?
it turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
when microsoft kinect came out , the motion-controlled add-on to its xbox gaming console , it immediately drew the attention of hackers .
take the travel service nextpedition .
is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? yes .
or they can simply smile , and remain open to all possibilities .
and then we can form , in effect , a mesh network .
and here we are at 2010 , average life expectancy of a child born today , age 79 , and we are not done yet .
unfortunately , it 's not .
and when you look at what happens to that pipeline , you start out maybe with thousands , tens of thousands of compounds .
but it took 23 years to get this far . that 's too long .
fc : excellent . so sam took the day off from school today to be here , and he is — ( applause ) — he is , by the way , a straight-a+ student in the ninth grade in his school in boston .
would n't it be great if we could do that more systematically ?
we have many discussions now between nih and companies about doing this that are looking very promising .
and you could expect quite a lot to come from this .
it was developed for cancer . it was azt .
it did n't work very well for cancer , but became the first successful antiretroviral , and you can see from the table there are others as well .
it just started last december , and this is one of its goals .
how do we know , for instance , whether drugs are safe before we give them to people ? we test them on animals .
and it 's not all that reliable , and it 's costly , and it 's time-consuming .
this is something created by the wyss institute in boston , and what they have done here , if we can run the little video , is to take cells from an individual , turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung , and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe .
what do we need to capitalize on this ? first of all , we need resources .
not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning .
please turn off your radio , eleanor .
he 's speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators can not .
do n't they sound incredible ?
and in fact , because their minds do n't fit into society 's version of normal , they 're often bypassed and misunderstood .
and i can not remember the first moment i encountered autism , but i can not recall a day without it .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
he screamed a lot .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
'the world ' is objective , logical , universal , factual , scientific .
there is my world and there is your world , and my world is always better than your world , because my world , you see , is rational and yours is superstition .
what goes around always comes around , and this rule applies not just to man , but also the gods .
the other believes this is one of many lives .
it 's always about taste .
there is no orchestra conductor .
there is one performer standing there , and everybody follows .
it 's not about compliance . it 's about setting , getting the job done , by bending or breaking the rules — just look at your indian people around here , you 'll see them smile ; they know what it is .
( laughter ) and then look at people who have done business in india , you 'll see the exasperation on their faces . ( laughter )
and i would see the exasperation between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
and he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets .
but belief is not measurable .
you see it is based on the hindu ritual of darshan .
so , when you go to the temple , all you seek is an audience with god .
because you do n't know whether you 're right or wrong , and so all you seek is divine empathy .
`` `` just know where i came from , why i did the jugaad . '' ''
that sensitivity is what we need . once this belief enters , behavior will happen , business will happen .
and when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
who sees it all ?
every life form on this planet — every insect , every bacteria , every plant , every animal , every human , every politician — ( laughter ) is coded in that stuff .
and we could start dating things , and we could start changing medicine and archeology .
and we 're beginning to find these little things for malaria , for sickle cell , for cancers .
because this friday , 50 years ago , watson and crick found the structure of dna , and that is almost as important a date as the 12th of february when we first mapped ourselves , but anyway , we 'll get to that .
and we 're finding amoebas like this . this is the amoeba dubia .
and , again , we 're learning from life and how life works .
we should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye .
again , we did n't know this thing was there three years ago .
this apple is the same thing as this floppy disk .
in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it — and , by the way , the first plant was read two years ago ; the first human was read two years ago ; the first insect was read two years ago .
and what you can do now is , you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is , and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here , and what those genes code for , and what animals they code against , and then you can tie it to the literature .
how 's this stuff work ? if each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand , but only three percent codes , which means it 's only one in a thousand times three percent , very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference . take a simple declarative sentence .
that 's perfectly clear . so , men read that sentence , and they look at that sentence , and they read this .
that 's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand .
you can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation .
these little chippies , these things are the size of a credit card .
if it is not expressing in your body , if you do n't have one of those types — a particular one of those types — do n't take gleevec .
and you can break it out by counties , because it 's specific counties .
it 's got nothing to do with privatization .
oh , yeah , and it takes about 5.6 million indians .
they did n't keep the people who were educated .
it turns out that if you 'd gone to the u.n. in 1950 , when it was founded , there were 50 countries in this world .
and the really interesting thing is , you and your kids are empowered to build great empires , and you do n't need a lot to do it .
`` and i would see kids on the street corners , and they 'd say `` '' obama , he 's our brother ! '' '' and i 'd say `` '' well , obama 's my brother , so that makes you my brother too . '' '' and they would look quizzically , and then be like , `` '' high five ! '' '' and it was here that i met jane . ''
and in the next couple of weeks , she 's going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development .
because when systems are broken , like the ones that we 're seeing around the world , it 's an opportunity for invention and for innovation .
it 's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings , so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .
so the machine i 'm going to talk you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was .
now , i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture . ( laughter ) he was a very wealthy man , and a sort of , part of the aristocracy of britain , and on a saturday night in marylebone , were you part of the intelligentsia of that period , you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree — and he invited everybody : kings , the duke of wellington , many , many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines .
every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive .
you see it all like this .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
along comes this woman , ada lovelace .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
it 's not , historically , totally accurate that she 's the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
it used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first zx81 .
thank you very much . ( applause )
so let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further .
and the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me , but i have no idea who they are .
and this is my profile .
i have navigated to a total of four .
all in all , there 's over 150 sites that are now tracking my personal information , most all of them without my consent .
and as adults , we 're certainly not alone .
at the same time i installed my own collusion profile , i installed one for my daughter .
going forward , all of our voices need to be heard .
( applause )
how can we build that bridge to yet ?
so the native kids outdid the microsoft kids .
and this has been true for 30 years , and the handover in 1979 , 1980 , between one jamaican leader who was the son of a rhodes scholar and a q.c . to another who 'd done an economics doctorate at harvard , over 800 people were killed in the streets in drug-related violence .
well , what we 've seen is the creation , in places like iraq and afghanistan , of democratic systems of government which have n't had any of those side benefits .
in afghanistan , for example , we have n't just had one election or two elections . we 've gone through three elections , presidential and parliamentary . and what do we find ?
and when i have conversations with people , i remember having a conversation , for example , in iraq , with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us , this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building , was a sign of the new democracy .
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
the point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate , effective , prosperous rule of law .
it is a state of mind . it is an activity .
we need to stop that , to stop pretending to be omniscient beings .
that can mean different things in different countries .
it 's a question of what the citizens do .
they control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .
and the very first thing was about regional food — trying to eat food from within our region .
and clearly , with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage , or when — as the fossil fuel is going away , as oil hits its peak oil , you know , we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should , or could , be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it .
now , most school districts ca n't really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock-full of chemicals .
seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry .
and the result of it is , we have diseases .
we can not believe that they have our best interests at heart .
i really try and teach it to kids . i think it 's the most important .
you know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher , because if it did n't come in a can , it came frozen in a box .
the usda allows this .
now i do n't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets , but i 'm sure you 're rich if you did .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
you know , what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken ?
you know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things .
you 're not going to get the next generation , or the generation after , to be able to think like this if they 're not nourished .
now one of the things that — what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people , very , very different , and i needed to market it .
so this is a typical menu .
we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference .
where is learning to talk ?
and if we 're going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to rethink that .
and then , at one in the afternoon , they 're totally crashing .
and , you know , i 'm not that better off now .
we have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again , because , of course , they do n't — because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long .
instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda , i think it should be under cdc .
okay , finance 101 on this , and this — i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece , because i think this is something we all have to understand .
that number probably needs to double .
the richest country .
it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that ca n't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food .
whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grandchildren , or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers ' market . just do tastings with them .
several year later , i managed to successfully fail all of my exams and did n't really leave school with much to show for at all , and my parents , maybe as a reward , bought me what turned out to be a one-way ticket to australia , and i came back home about four years later .
and i realize — again , it 's kind of these realizations looking back as to what i did — i realize now that it was pretty much the same as moving sheep around .
and that 's kind of been a big lesson to me , that you ca n't act on any object .
it was about five meters long , and i covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess , but i learned to print .
`` and then i took it back to the printers and showed them what i 've done , and they were like , `` '' of course you can do that . ''
there 's lots of different things we 've created .
it uploads a picture , and the reason why it chose that cake for you , to our facebook page and to twitter .
so a couple of things i 've created are , there 's a poster over here that you can play drums on .
i just love bringing technology together , having a lot of fun , being creative .
this may all sound really quite alarming to some people , an index of something worrying or wrong in society .
it 's a really great image . it 's pretty cool .
now , to try and explain this in sort of real terms , i want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games .
now you can think about this , if you like , as a problem about boxes .
but we do n't just do that either .
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .
every time you do something , you get credit ; you get a credit for trying .
fourth , feedback .
pollution , global warming , these things — the consequences are distant in time and space .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
and in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them — 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
so players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other , fairly and transparently .
we 're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters .
( applause )
`` and he 's standing on the deck of his ship , he 's talking to his first mate , and he 's saying , `` '' tomorrow , we will sail past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called sirens . ''
this repeats itself through the night — rehearsal , tying to the mast , conning his way out of it , beating the poor first mate up mercilessly .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you do n't do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
but then there 's this other self , the future self .
and the future self is not even around .
it does n't even have a lawyer present .
there 's nobody to stick up for the future self .
so there 's this battle between the two selves that 's being fought , and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two .
because it 's not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
because not writing is bad , but giving to charity is good .
sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
so this is a timely problem .
there 's a philosopher , derek parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i .
it means that you have to save more today .
`` once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click `` '' done '' '' and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one . ''
now people are motivated through emotions , but different people find different things motivating .
so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , i show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you 're retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on .
those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the internet .
so what we do is we take pictures of people — in this case , college-age people — and we use software to age them and show these people what they 'll look like when they 're 60 , 70 , 80 years old .
and what 's nice about it is it 's not something that biasing people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face frowns .
and that 's something that 's easy to forget .
hal is here , so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .
on behalf of hal and myself , i wish all the best to your present and future selves .
you know , people are very wedded to these , actually .
i do n't know if you 've done those .
a lot of companies use these for recruitment .
you are the individuals you are , and you have this kind of core .
you have desires , maybe for a cookie , maybe for something that we do n't want to talk about at 11 o'clock in the morning in a school .
of course we do n't .
everything else in the universe is the same .
why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts , but somehow being a separate , permanent entity which has those parts ?
`` this is paul broks , he 's a clinical neuropsychologist , and he says this : `` '' we have a deep intuition that there is a core , an essence there , and it 's hard to shake off , probably impossible to shake off , i suspect . ''
the term i use in the book , i call it the ego trick .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
there is no real you .
these are three psychologists , thomas metzinger , bruce hood , susan blackmore , a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion , the self is an illusion , it 's a fiction .
but i do n't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it .
for one thing , it 's always changing .
there are limits to what we can achieve .
but nevertheless , we do have this capacity to , in a sense , shape ourselves .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
we 've also shared other sorts of entertainment — sports arenas , public parks , concert halls , libraries , universities .
more people , smaller spaces , less stuff .
it 's also — web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems , and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance .
for example , i want to use zipcar .
car-sharing was actually invented in europe .
`` one of the founders went to switzerland , saw it implemented someplace , said , `` '' wow , that looks really cool . ''
they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching .
meanwhile , these guys are sitting back , collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service .
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network , there are all these networks — facebook as well .
now we 're saying that there 's other options as well .
so i was having a coffee in portland , and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes .
essentially , there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland , near where i live .
an area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people .
the crafty fox is this woman who 's into crafts , and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around london .
i grew up watching star trek . i love star trek .
now , flight — what does it take to fly ?
now , what about the engine ?
they have two types of flight muscle : so-called power muscle , which is stretch-activated , which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system .
it 's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight , and it fills the middle portion of the fly , so when a fly hits your windshield , it 's basically the power muscle that you 're looking at .
these devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight , and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very , very fast corrective maneuvers .
when we think of brain , we of course imagine our own brain .
but remember that this kind of brain , which is much , much smaller — instead of 100 billion neurons , it has 100,000 neurons — but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for 400 million years .
so this is basically multiplexing in time .
you allow them to steer towards the little stripe , and they 'll just steer towards that stripe forever .
so for the first time we 've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly 's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight .
and this is a big concern , especially considering where we are now .
coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about 200 nautical miles , in areas that are called exclusive economic zones , and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas , because the high seas , which are the darker areas on this map , the high seas , it 's a lot harder to control things , because it has to be done internationally .
you get into international agreements , and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement , you know this can be a very slow , frustrating , tedious process .
do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries ?
we know because we 've seen it happening in a lot of different places .
when these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies , the fisheries , which are always crashing , it seems , are starting to come back .
we should obviously do this just because it 's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem , but it 's also cost-effective .
it also has a very low carbon footprint .
it takes a little bit of fuel , but as you know , agriculture can have a carbon footprint , and fish has a much smaller one , so it 's less polluting .
it can reduce our risks of cancer , heart disease and obesity .
you have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with , and so there 's a constant push-pull there .
when we do things that produce biodiversity , we actually get more abundance , and that 's important so that we can feed people .
you might have heard about this .
snappers , nine out of 10 snappers were not snapper .
we know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that do n't use the land , that do n't use much water , have a low carbon footprint , and are cost-effective .
we know that saving the oceans can feed the world , and we need to start now .
in the u.s. alone , there 's more than four million miles of roads , very expensive to build , very expensive to maintain infrastructure , with a huge ecological footprint , and yet , very often , congested .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
the second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther , or pick up or deliver loads .
let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail .
first of all , the uavs .
that 's roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan .
we think this can be — this is the power of a new paradigm .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
congestion is a huge problem .
well , we chose to do this one not because it 's easy , but because it can have amazing impact .
so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems .
but it 's just one chemical .
first , do n't become a cannibal .
but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom .
so when i die , the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it .
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
it 's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores .
the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dysfunctional family .
i thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy . ( applause ) it was n't like i was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker , or anything like that , but the amount of resistance i got from this freedom of information request , you would have thought i 'd asked something like this .
so i fought for about five years doing this , and it was one of many hundreds of requests that i made , not — i did n't — hey , look , i did n't set out , honestly , to revolutionize the british parliament .
well , guess what ? i won . hooray . ( applause ) well , that 's not exactly the story , because the problem was that parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data , and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them .
obviously the church were n't very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they had n't counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution .
and they 're all moving to this central system , this fully connected system , all of them except one . can you guess which one ?
in my own field of investigative journalism , we 're also having to start thinking globally , so this is a site called investigative dashboard . and if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets , for example , hosni mubarak , you know , he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble , and what you want to do to investigate that is , you need to have access to all of the world 's , as many as you can , companies ' house registrations databases .
he actually said that , it was a matter of life and death .
there was no evidence . he presented no evidence of that .
i hope you 'll join me next time when i will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he american economy .
( laughter ) so , the assignment i 've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me , but i 'm certainly going to try .
one was to tedmed , and one , as you 've heard , was a regular ted two years ago .
and this gives me enormous hope .
if you have appendicitis , they take your appendix out , and you 're cured .
you 've heard that word several times in the last four days , and everyone 's familiar with kuhnian paradigms .
i 've felt it in the operating room , at the bedside .
what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves , out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit ?
every disadvantaged nation , and perhaps our own nation , becomes our patient .
so , you go back to the old indo-european root again , and what do you find ? the indo-european stem is pronounced payen — we would spell it p-a-e-n — and , lo and behold , mirabile dictu , it is the same root as the word compassion comes from , p-a-e-n .
of course , in this day and age , the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get — can get in the way .
now , if we 're talking about medicine , and we 're talking about healing , i 'd like to quote someone who has n't been quoted .
this is taken in nigeria right after having taken the washington , d.c. bar exam .
( applause ) ca : and at the time , you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur , working with satellites .
tell us about that .
( laughter ) ca : so that succeeded despite all predictions at the time .
the reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female .
ca : and yet , a year or two later , you were there with a medicine that worked for jenesis .
mr : yes . jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady .
but instead she chooses to work in united therapeutics .
the only cure for pulmonary hypertension , pulmonary fibrosis , cystic fibrosis , emphysema , copd , what leonard nimoy just died of , is a lung transplant , but sadly , there are only enough available lungs for 2,000 people in the u.s. a year to get a lung transplant , whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end-stage lung failure .
i 'm as certain of that as i was of the success that we 've had with direct television broadcasting , sirius xm .
mr : what this graph means , and it comes from ray kurzweil , is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware , firmware and software , has been advancing along a curve such that by the 2020s , as we saw in earlier presentations today , there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind .
how do you describe that ?
she 's kind of like a two-year-old kid , but she says things that blow people away , best expressed by perhaps a new york times pulitzer prize-winning journalist amy harmon who says her answers are often frustrating , but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she 's interviewed .
`` each day , we are always saying , like , `` '' wow , i love you even more than 30 years ago . ''
i mean , look , when you got married , if someone had told you that , in a few years time , the man you were marrying would become a woman , and a few years after that , you would become a robot — ( laughter ) — how has this gone ? how has it been ?
i 've been doing that for about 10 years .
i do toys . the bulk of my work is in computer games .
yeah , a lot of you got it .
i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american .
`` and `` '' right answer , '' '' of course there might be more than one right answer ; many puzzles have more than one . ''
but as opposed to a couple other forms of play , toys and games — by toy i mean , something you play with that does n't have a particular goal .
the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact .
i like pushing on what an ambigram can mean .
thank you very much .
now , those are fun to look at .
for a while i was an interface designer .
it 's made by the company think fun .
you know ? what do you do here ?
i wanted to make a sequel .
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .
so , here is what i created for discover magazine .
but it takes some persistence .
so , we 're making smart games for social media .
and then there is social media , and what 's happening on the internet .
and we decided to combine our skills .
oh , yeah . there , okay . j-o and — i guess that 's that part . we got the bow . that bow helps .
that 's his hair . you get a lot of figure-ground problems .
i want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about — and that 's exactly what is happening — is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
now , this may surprise you .
take a look , if you have n't , at donorschoose .
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose .
one of the best known is acumen fund , led by jacqueline novogratz , a tedster who got a big boost here at ted .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
now , what 's really interesting here is that we 're not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we 're acting our way into a new way of thinking .
philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes .
`` words like `` '' philanthrocapitalism , '' '' and `` '' natural capitalism , '' '' and `` '' philanthroentrepreneur , '' '' and `` '' venture philanthropy . '' '' we do n't have a language for it yet . ''
and that 's where my imagined future comes in , which i am going to call the social singularity .
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a convergence of catastrophes , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty .
whatever that means to you .
and there 's a very good reason for that .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson ?
`` and i love this : `` '' watson vanquishes human opponents . '' '' jeopardy 's not an easy game . ''
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity 's grand challenges .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource-liberating force .
he 's the dude on the left .
but the king of siam , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
it 's the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum .
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if that pans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
and if they 're on a smartphone on google , they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
what does it actually mean ?
which means , are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations ?
so it has to be the big three at grc . that 's another metric .
if 97.5 percent of the world 's water is saltwater , 2.5 percent is fresh water . less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use .
a halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant .
there is a drawback to algae , however : it 's very expensive .
in our greenlab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater .
if you are a farmer , you need five things to be successful : you need seeds , you need soil , you need water and you need sun , and the last thing that you need is fertilizer .
it 's a wonderful plant . i love that plant .
now we get to chaetomorpha .
we are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic .
if we are successful , we will revolutionize the plastics industry .
how about this : in sub-saharan africa , next to the sea , saltwater , barren desert , how about we take that plant , plant it , half use for food , half use for fuel .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
oh , i thought it was funny . ( laughter ) and at the bottom is seaman 's mustard . it does make sense , this is a logical snack . you have mustard , you are a seaman , you see the halophyte , you mix it together , it 's a great snack with some crackers .
there 's something missing to be complete .
in about 30 days or so they 'll be connected to the greenlab .
she 'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent when he turned the paper in late .
the principal did n't want to stand up to the parent because he did n't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings .
and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits , like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants .
so , what do we do about it ?
so , let 's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above .
tens of thousands of discreet rules , 60 steps to suspend a student from school : it 's a formula for paralysis .
what 's the effect of that ? one is a decline in order .
my favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure .
and it is this : law sets boundaries , and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you ca n't do or must do — you ca n't steal , you 've got to pay your taxes — but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom .
( applause ) we have to rehumanize the law .
they 're still bounded by legal goals and principles : the teacher is accountable to the principal , the judge is accountable to an appellate court , the president is accountable to voters .
we can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy .
if teachers do n't have authority to run the classroom , to maintain order , everybody 's learning suffers .
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .
how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is .
so , what have we learned ?
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
in fact , even back during the ancients , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this .
the copernican dream was unfulfilled .
unfortunately , as you can see , there was a very different picture .
we were still back where copernicus was .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
why i 'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part .
and that 's what many people now are trying to do .
so this is one example that i want to show you here .
we do n't want to go blind because there 's too many possibilities , and there is not too much lab , and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .
and look at this image of the tiny , blue dot .
it is the earth as we know it .
but it 's really tiny .
and let 's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms .
let me try it .
we ca n't imagine it .
think about those oldest living things on earth , but in a cosmic proportion .
this is not insignificant .
so life might be insignificant in size , but it is not insignificant in time .
it was a ridiculous thing to do , really , but i could n't think of anything else , and so there i stood .
you see , in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians , there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you do n't hear about , and those people need our support to succeed .
according to a 2009 survey of arabic language media resources , between 2004 and 2008 , no more than 15 percent of al qaeda 's victims were westerners .
they 're not conservative or traditional approaches .
but that violence is just the tip of the iceberg .
so what i 'm seeking is a new way of talking about this all together , which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines .
and then the next year , they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk .
this was a time when the pakistani taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls ' schools that would culminate in the attack on malala yousafzai .
maria bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in afghanistan .
she 's been in the post since 2008 and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women , which she says is the most important area in her mandate .
`` sometimes i still hear her voice in my head saying , with no bravado whatsoever , `` '' the situation of the women of afghanistan will be better someday . ''
abdirizak bihi 's studious 17-year-old nephew burhan hassan was recruited here in 2008 , spirited to somalia , and then killed when he tried to come home .
given his own lack of financial resources , mr. bihi has had to be creative .
to counter the efforts of al shabaab to sway more disaffected youth , in the wake of the group 's 2010 attack on world cup viewers in uganda , he organized a ramadan basketball tournament in minneapolis in response .
she refused to give up her studies , despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education .
`` shortly before her death , amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters , `` '' nothing will happen to us , inshallah , god willing , but if something happens , you must know that we are dead for knowledge . ''
why is it that everyone knows who osama bin laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin ladens in their own contexts .
we must change that , and so i ask you to please help share these stories through your networks .
as a scientist , i 've been a crew commander for a nasa mars simulation last year , and as an artist , i create multicultural community art all over the planet .
hi-seas is a nasa-funded planetary surface analogue on the mauna loa volcano in hawaii , and it 's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long-term isolation of small crews .
other than that , there 's not much of a problem .
intimacy means physical , emotional connection with somebody else — and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous , contradictory , phosphorescent signals .
and we 're seeing a steady increase among males .
it 's a social awkwardness .
so the effect , very quickly , is it 's a new kind of arousal .
it 's actually morphed .
it 's held every two years in burma .
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter .
now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks ?
they have no side effects , or if they do , they 're imaginary , so you can safely ignore them .
it actually works by giving you the impression that you 've had a very good education , which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence , which then makes you very , very successful in later life .
`` i told this story and a gentleman from turkey came up to me and said , `` very , very good marketer , fredrick the great . but not a patch on ataturk . '' ''
ataturk , rather like nicolas sarkozy , was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil , in turkey , to modernize it .
now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil .
because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people 's behavior .
`` in britain we tend to feel , `` '' whoa ! got another three ! '' '' not so in italy . ''
it was made of cast iron .
now , marketing has done a very , very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying .
man : they — yeah , it 's all in the appearance .
they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
( applause )
we all want affirmations that our lives have meaning .
you do n't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us , huh ?
`` it 's like a guy inviting you around the campfire , or somebody in a bar saying , `` '' here , let me tell you a story . ''
it 's the most inclusive approach you can take .
we 're born problem solvers .
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .
but under that was this global tension of will we ever find nemo in this huge , vast ocean ?
`` and we had naively thought , well woody in `` '' toy story '' '' has to become selfless at the end , so you 've got to start from someplace . ''
so let 's make him selfish . and this is what you get .
off the bed .
you do n't think i was right ?
and that 's what it really is , is that we all live life conditionally .
and i saw that thing seven times in one month .
as : that was the theme : who are you ? here were all these seemingly disparate
when i was five , i was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that i feel a story should have , but is rarely invoked .
look .
thumper : some fun , huh , bambi ?
`` and when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth , he looked straight at my mom and said , `` he 's not going to live . '' ''
it does n't always mean plot or fact .
it means capturing a truth from your experiencing it , expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core .
my journey to coming here today started in 1974 .
i was 17 and going on a peace walk .
i started going out on cases .
`` and that was , `` '' how did this happen to me ? '' '' and in fact , what did happen to my brain ? ''
and toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out .
and it had a chilling effect on me .
the thing i had to admit to myself , with great repulsion , was that i get it .
and so what is this ? how does this work ?
for those of you who are n't familiar with memetics , a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus , much like a virus . the way a virus works is — it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system .
all i have to do is humbly follow .
now this was revolutionary .
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
now if you saw an apple do that , you 'd want to know why .
similarly , the astronomers ' results are surely well-deserving of the nobel prize , but they raised an analogous question .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
this number is small .
from five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — a large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do .
here 's the idea .
because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
and in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies do n't form .
one key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far i 've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes .
the big bang leaves out something pretty important , the bang .
and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory .
and if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect .
so astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness .
now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
why ?
the b15 iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf .
and if we just take one cell 's worth of this code and unwind it , it 's a meter long , two nanometers thick .
and i wondered , what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places , where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms ?
so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there , and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas .
we like the light that comes into the room , but in the middle of summer , all that heat is coming into the room that we 're trying to keep cool .
you think of carbon as black .
carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
it 's a film that you can look through .
and you can see , off a tiny film , incredible clarity .
in terms of dollars per what 's stored , it 's simply the best .
being able to do that means that i can generate energy cleanly , efficiently and cheaply right where i am .
but in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
you do n't have enough time .
( applause )
now , we 've mapped that afterglow with great precision , and when i say we , i mean people who are n't me .
fourteen billion light years that way and 14 billion light years that way , it 's the same temperature .
over here , it 's a little hotter , and over there , it 's a little cooler , and that 's incredibly important to everyone in this room , because where it was a little hotter , there was a little more stuff , and where there was a little more stuff , we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos .
this is n't conclusive evidence for inflation , but anything that is n't inflation that explains this will look the same .
( applause )
all of that could be described using newton 's work .
but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story , because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity , he 'd been unable to figure out how it really works .
how is it that the sun , 93 million miles away , [ that ] somehow it affects the motion of the earth ?
we go to a full-frame view of this .
that 's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas , one set of principles , one master equation , if you will .
maybe i can play the same game with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the electromagnetic force — we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about .
einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity .
amazing — it just popped out .
he , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming — ( laughter ) — then dove into the ocean .
and number two : does this theory really work in detail , when you try to apply it to the world around us ?
it 's very hard to see it , though , from far away .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
it looks like a vibrating string — that 's where the idea , string theory comes from .
rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us .
and that 's what we mean by a unified theory .
now you might think about that and say , well , ok , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they 're really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we wo n't see them , if they 're small enough .
but if there 's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we wo n't see them either . that is true .
one of the other predictions of string theory — no , that 's not one of the other predictions of string theory .
this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
when you swing your hand , you 'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they 're so small that we would n't know it .
now in string theory , all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate .
so let me bring some strings into the story .
so , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton — that 's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
but here 's how the experiment will go .
einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve — that 's what gravity is .
thank you very much .
i was the son of an aerospace engineer .
is it possible to explore the stratosphere ?
and when i got to 10,000 feet , i opened a parachute and i landed .
we 've got an amazing suit that was made by ilc dover .
they had never sold a suit commercially , only to the government , but they sold one to me , which i am very grateful for .
even if i was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit , which is extremely unlikely , this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space .
my heart rate was very low and i was trying not to use very much oxygen .
( video ) ground control . everyone ready ?
and there you can see a drogue parachute , which i 'll demonstrate in just a second , because that 's really important .
there 's the balloon going by a second time .
( applause )
and i 'm absolutely enthralled by biology .
and evolution , although it was established well over 100 years ago by charles darwin and a vast number of other people , evolution still is a little bit intangible .
is biology special ?
this is a dead crystal , and i 'm going to do something to it , and it 's going to become alive .
and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago , and they look alive .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
in biology , carbon takes center stage .
and in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology , then we have all this wonderful diversity of life .
if your pen could replicate , that would be a bit of a problem .
but before we can make life , let 's think for a second what life really is characterized by .
and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
you have regulation ; information is transcribed ; catalysts are made ; stuff is happening .
you can decode the genome , you can look back , you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna , but we ca n't get further than the last ancestor , the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .
so what we 're trying to do is do reactions — not in one flask , but in tens of flasks , and connect them together , as you can see with this flow system , all these pipes .
but we need to make some containers .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .
biology does n't care about the design unless it works .
and the profound realization for me is that , if this works , the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level , and we really start talking about selfish matter .
ca : that would be a big story .
do n't go and look for carbon , go and look for evolvable stuff .
and because we shared our genetic information with linda , she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna — haplotype k1a1b1a — which meant that we were distantly related .
i mean this is the iphone 4 .
and coming up next month is actually future med , a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .
and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
here in the netherlands , i think it 's more than 80 percent .
but now that we 're switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , i can access my patients ' data from wherever i am just through my mobile device .
and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .
this was developed by colleagues at stanford , called the irhythm — completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity .
now we 're also in the era , today , of quantified self .
and i would argue , in the future , we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes , monitoring ourselves 24/7 .
how about augmenting the physician ?
we 're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .
and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .
this is aimee mullins , who lost her lower limbs as a young child , and hugh herr , who 's a professor at mit who lost his limbs in a climbing accident .
and they 're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely .
again , in early trials , but moving into the future .
and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care .
not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes — exponentially cheaper .
and soon we 'll have millions of these tests available .
my data indicates that i 've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration , a kind of blindness .
so if you think of cancer as a weed , we often can whack the weed away .
so we 're attacking the wrong target .
we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
and we 're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering , and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing — replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ .
and as a cancer doctor , i 'm looking forward to being out of a job .
thanks very much .
it 's a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : is this water contaminated ?
that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
thank you .
these fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew .
the first problem that not just michigan , but every state , faces is , how do you create good jobs in america in a global economy ?
and in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years , or that we 'd help to build a new factory for the company , we 'd help to finance it . the uaw , who represented the workers , said they would offer unprecedented concessions , sacrifices to just keep those jobs in greenville .
in fact , they did implode the factory .
i went from high school to factory .
enigma number one : how do you create jobs in america in a global economy ?
what in the laboratory that i see out there , the laboratories of democracy , what has happened ?
you might say obamacare , except for those were not voluntary changes .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
why ? the government put a $ 4.5 billion pot and said to the governors across the country , compete for it .
and imagine what might happen , because every region has something to offer .
along the eastern seaboard , we 're going to lead the nation in offshore wind .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respects the states and it respects federalism .
because republican and democratic governors love to cut ribbons .
what if it all started here at ted ?
because , dear tedsters , if you are impatient like i am , you know that our economic competitors , our other nations , are in the game and are eating us for lunch .
some years ago , i set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water , fertilizer or land .
imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater , and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil , and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater , and the system that we 're going to build , of course , will use solar energy to grow the algae , and they use co2 , which is good , and they produce oxygen as they grow .
so let 's envision what the system might look like .
and the system is contained . what do i mean by that ?
the other thing to consider is the structure itself .
the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 , as we would .
and what you see here is the prototype , which was the first attempt at building this type of column .
so we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment , and i mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in moss landing marine lab .
we 'd be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food , and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes , ultimately , competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels .
well , that 's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay .
where else could we potentially put this system ?
there 's lots of possibilities .
i set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels , and en route i discovered that what 's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation .
jonathan trent : so it 's really gotten to a stage now in nasa where they would like to spin it out into something which would go offshore , and there are a lot of issues with doing it in the united states because of limited permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore .
i love my food .
and two of the things about bengal : they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets .
so by the time i grew up , again , i had a well-established passion for food .
what changed was the balance of the tissues available .
and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other .
that then set me off completely to say , okay , these two are connected .
when i moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
you bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way .
do you cook it ? do you have it served to you ?
which brings me to the final element of this .
it has probably not helped my waistline any because i like practicing on both sides .
thank you very much for your time .

very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world .
littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
i am the daughter of two hardworking , college-educated , african-american parents who chose careers as public servants : my father , a minister ; my mother , an educator .
why does n't everyone get this ?
but while we all know things were indeed separate , they were in no ways equal .
enter brown v. the board of education of topeka , kansas in 1954 ; legal separation of the races is now illegal .
they know that when it comes to schooling , black lives do n't matter and they never have .
for years , i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading .
i 'd amassed a modest classroom library of books i 'd accumulated from secondhand shops , thrift stores , attics — you know .
one day , after i 'd heard about this website called donorschoose , where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom and anonymous donors fulfill them , i figured i 'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list of the teenager 's dream library .
and on a micro level : if you 're a human being , donate .
what is an actress with no stage ?
( laughter ) and all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection .
and they see in our faces that our approval , that our love , that their very worth , comes from a 's .
`` ( applause ) but if you look at what we 've done , if you have the courage to really look at it , you 'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores , but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time , like our very own version of the movie `` '' being john malkovich , '' '' we send our children the message : `` hey kid , i do n't think you can actually achieve any of this without me . '' ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) did i just say chores ? did i just say chores ? i really did .
and more importantly , if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college , whichever one it is , well , they 'll have gone there on their own volition , fueled by their own desire , capable and ready to thrive there .
i have to admit something to you .
still a lot of you . ok .
a trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different to the way that we 've always done it .
i 'm on this big red circle . i can see .
does the way we build trust face-to-face translate online ?
`` but from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces , there is a common pattern that people follow , and i call it `` '' climbing the trust stack . '' '' let me use blablacar as an example to bring it to life . ''
so an idea that intrigued me , and i 'd like you to consider , is whether we can better understand major waves of disruption and change in individuals in society through the lens of trust .
it would be easy to conclude that institutional trust is n't working because we are fed up with the sheer audacity of dishonest elites , but what 's happening now runs deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions .
trust is no longer top-down .
it 's that simple . right .
i am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations all around the world trying to get governments to ban uber based on claims that it is unsafe .
`` and he wrote , `` '' does anyone have details of this # uber app everyone 's talking about ? ''
`` ( laughter ) i 'd never heard of it until today . '' '' now , the taxi associations , they legitimized the first layer of the trust stack . ''
in china , on didi , the ride-sharing platform , 11 million rides taken every day .
we meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with .
this is just the beginning , because the real disruption happening is n't technological .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
it 's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence .
we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia .
last year , we issued an even more difficult challenge .
a machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes .
where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations .
the fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data .
the future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question : to what extent is that job reducible to frequent , high-volume tasks , and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations ?
the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers ' attention .
in the early days of twitter , it was like a place of radical de-shaming .
advertisers would withdraw their advertising .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly , and in many of the places where it counts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything .
and so they decided , because they were intrigued by this finding , to do a nationwide survey .
you 'll watch them both drop out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men .
if you look at management theory these days , it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like general patton , right ?
and those are all things that women do very well .
to see what 's going to happen , you ca n't just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
people have asked men , why do n't they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
`` there 's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the `` '' boy crisis . '' '' now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys , for whatever reason , are doing worse in school than very young girls , and people have theories about that . ''
they are more controlled .
noa : why ? they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely .
certainly , when i was in college , i had certain expectations about my life — that my husband and i would both work , and that we would equally raise the children .
but these college girls had a completely different view of their future .
basically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their husband would maybe have a job , but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .
( laughter ) now you laugh , but that quote has kind of a sting to it , right ?
`` and what he did was he wrote down on the board `` $ 85,000 , '' and he said , `` '' that 's her salary , '' '' and then he wrote down `` '' $ 12,000 . '' '' `` `` that 's your salary . ''
`` so who 's the man now ? '' '' he asked them . ''
and here 's my favorite example , which is in south korea .
then we have our bud light guy who 's the happy couch potato .
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
so what did he make of all this ?
if only darwin lived today .
what 's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones .
now what happened in our history ?
so , it 's wonderful . we evolved this very protective , wonderful covering of melanin .
in the winter , when you are skiing in the alps , you may experience ultraviolet radiation .
how can we begin to understand it ?
200 years after darwin 's birthday , we have the first moderately pigmented president of the united states .
and he resembles , very closely , people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern africa , or southeast asia .
( applause )
now , this has really significant implications .
i did n't go in to the discover the political stuff , the social stuff .
during that time , health and safety has become everything about my job .
that 's one of the most dangerous horse stunts , certainly .
highly dangerous , but also you 'll notice it does n't look as though i 'm wearing anything underneath the suit .
there 's a guy with a flame thrower there , giving me what for .
and that 's a ramp . spring off the thing and fly through the air , and hopefully you make it look good .
you can just see , underneath the car , there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car .
( laughs ) i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
`` let 's just go for it . foot flat to the floor . '' '' well , you 'd die if you did that . ''
that 's the only reason we do it . see , it 's all fun , this job .
and on the other side of the fence , that physical art , the physical performance of the stuntman , has interfaced with the very highest technology in i.t . and in software .
it 's 30 feet . it 's water . it 's very simple .
we fly people on wires , like this .
this guy is not skydiving . he 's being flown like a kite , or moved around like a kite .
and this is a guinness world record attempt .
project excelsior , it was called .
now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet — it 's great , is n't it ? — when you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen .
above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet , you need pressure breathing , which is where you 're wearing a g suit .
certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
it was made by a russian that 's designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the soviets .
you know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet and the cabin depressurizes , you can have oxygen .
your blood tries to boil . it 's called vaporization .
thank you . he 's very hot . thank you , costa .
and it does n't look far different when it 's inflated , as you can see from the picture down there .
and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab .
the cells are kind of homesick ; the dish does n't feel like their home .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
it 's amazing that these cells beat at all .
but what 's really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
but that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work .
behind every sound , sight , touch , taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us .
( applause )
and so , i fused together the two things i loved the most , which was skiing and windsurfing .
`` and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , `` well , what we 're going to do here is really important , you know . '' ''
`` and they would give the projects code names , you know , mostly from `` '' star wars , '' '' actually : things like c3po , yoda , luke . ''
and i wanted to really not just work on the skins , but i wanted to work on the entire human experience .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for herman miller .
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
and it 's done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
so jawbone is a project that you 're familiar with , and it has a humanistic technology .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it is n't beautiful , it really does n't belong on your face .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
the packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
and hosain rahman , the ceo of aliph jawbone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
and then the integration of all these great technologies , which you 've heard about , the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ; the screen , which you can read in sunlight ; the keyboard , which is made out of rubber , and it 's protected from the environment .
so , now you get these pictures — you get up in the morning , and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers , and in mongolia .
so , i 'm going to finish with one last project , and this is a little bit more of adult play .
today i want to talk to you about the future , but first i 'm going to tell you a bit about the past .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon .
but i 'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
last summer i worked at stanford university , doing some research on cancer stem cells .
so , if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it 's initiating cancer , it 's almost as if this is a repair response .
and i really think that we ca n't think about cancer — let alone any disease — in such black-and-white terms .
we 're removing the cancer cells , but we 're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
`` and skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body , or over 50 percent of our body . and so at first i kind of thought , `` '' well , maybe there 's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle does n't get cancer — at least not that i know of . '' '' so , i looked further into it , found as many articles as i could , and it was amazing — because it turned out that it was very rare . ''
and what metastases are is when the tumor — when a piece — breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ . that 's what a metastasis is .
`` so these articles were saying , you know , `` '' skeletal — metastasis to skeletal muscle — is very rare . '' '' but it was left at that . no one seemed to be asking why . ''
so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer .
so this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle — or perhaps even more , an angiogenic routing factor , so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow — this could be a potential future therapy for cancer .
is it possible that skeletal muscle does n't express this type of molecules ?
`` now , one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer — to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body — is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called `` '' myod . '' '' and what myod essentially does is , it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells . so this compound , myod , has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells . ''
that 's a very far-fetched idea , but i really believe that it may be possible .
( applause )
if you look at the math , e=mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there 's an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe — these are things that are really difficult to understand .
and so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of biovisions at harvard , which is a website that harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will — in addition to all the textual information , in addition to all the didactic stuff — put everything together visually , so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty , and be able to study with this view in mind , so that their imaginations would be sparked ,
but they get the information that causes them to stop , causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape , and try to get out of this capillary and find out what 's going on .
and figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on , but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening .
and so what i 'm going to show you is a three-minute reader 's digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced . it 's an ongoing project that 's going to go another four or five years .
this little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that 's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it 's needed in the cell — whether it 's to a membrane , whether it 's to an organelle , whether it 's to build something or repair something .
enjoy the rest of the show . thank you .
the whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
and i got 60 pieces out of it for my school because i felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day .
`` and now that i 've given lots of speeches , we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me , and they said , `` '' mr. strickland , what an extraordinary story and what a great school . ''
and he called me into his office — which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz ( laughter ) — and john heinz had 600 million dollars , and at the time i had about 60 cents .
and we 've never looked back .
because i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center .
it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america .
but this is my view of how students ought to be treated , particularly once they have been pushed aside .
there is absolutely no reason why poor people ca n't learn world class technology .
well , i went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood , the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm , you can bring them right back to life .
we have ceramics and photography and computer imaging .
and by the time i cut these kids loose from high school , they 've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it 's all up here .
i gave this little slide show at a place called the silicon valley and i did all right .
and that 's the room that 's initiating the relationship .
and like a fool , i did n't go to the ceremony because i did n't think we were going to win .
including my mother and father , who lived long enough to see their kid build that building .
it 's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot — triple that in the middle of the inner city .
( laughter ) and as a result of the association , i 'm now a director of the mellon financial corporation that bought dreyfus .
`` and he walked in and he says , `` '' what is this ? '' '' and i said , `` '' herbie , this is my concept of a training center for poor people . '' '' and he said , `` '' as god as my witness , i 've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you 've built it . ''
`` and now i really want to build one . '' '' i said , `` '' well , where would you build this thing ? '' '' he said , `` '' san francisco . '' '' i said , `` '' any chance you know willie brown ? '' '' ( laughter ) as a matter of fact he did know willie brown , and willie brown and herbie and i had dinner four years ago , and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth . ''
`` he came up to me afterwards , he said , `` '' man , that 's a fabulous story . ''
`` and quincy said , `` '' where did the idea for centers like this come from ? '' '' and i said , `` '' it came from your music , man . ''
`` because mr. ross used to bring in your albums when i was 16 years old in the pottery class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sunlight . '' '' and i said , `` '' if i can follow that music , i 'll get out into the sunlight and i 'll be ok . ''
i believe in your hopes and your dreams , i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your enthusiasm .
i am banking on you and i 'm banking on guys like herbie and quincy and hackett and richard and very decent people who still believe in something .
( applause )
i 've spent much of my career working with journalists , with bloggers , with activists , with human rights researchers all around the world , and i 've come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down on protecting and defending human rights , freedom of the press and a free and open internet , radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist .
( applause ) ok , all done . thank you very much .
we 're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed , charged and intimidated by their own governments , many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror .
freedom house , the human rights organization , reports that 2015 marks the 10th straight year in a row of decline in freedom worldwide .
yet authorities in countries like the united states , the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption , because the bad guys are using it , too .
and journalists are n't immune .
they need to carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems that we 're clearly seeing .
now , i 've been talking for the last 10 minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these .
all around the world , people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression are linking up in their communities and across borders .
we 've also got to be more mindful about how our own personal , political , consumer and business choices affect people like these around the world .
shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury — fine title — about the tragedy in southern asia .
in some way , god must feel the anguish , and grief , and physical pain that we feel .
and if this is true , it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit , as well .
we want a god who can weep with those who weep , and rejoice with those who rejoice .
so we have a suffering god — a god who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul .
over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate , a bit dodgy .
`` and last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs , `` the wise man built his house upon the rock . '' ''
so the first big question is about control .
i can remember someone saying this to me , with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of god .
a cosmic us and them , and a god who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism ?
perhaps there is a great , cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out ok in the end .
perhaps , but these ideas are all just variations on god controlling everything , the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign .
namaste .
in music and poetry , in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life , there is a deep , indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary .
( beatboxing ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) but as far as being a performer , i 'm also diagnosed bipolar .
( laughter ) i was sent to a place , a psych ward , and in the psych ward , everyone is doing their own one-man show . ( laughter )
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum — you know what i 'm talking about — not maybe full bipolar , but they 're in the bipolar spectrum — where on one side , maybe you think you 're jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
so what we are asking in the lab is , how can we leverage that power ?
( shooting noises ) the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
by that statement , their vision should be really bad , right ?
imagine you 're driving in a fog . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident , or getting into an accident .
so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
now , when we do brain imaging , we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you 're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
we obviously do n't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have . that would be a little costly proposition . but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure , to millisecond accuracy , how good they are at switching from one task to another .
you ca n't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games . they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition , perception and attention .
that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
and one more step is to do training studies .
that 's our target shape .
there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you ca n't resist .
who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
and publishers , so these are not people that usually meet every day , but it 's actually doable , and we are on the right track .
it 's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action .
and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that .
and the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career , trying to design , build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras .
we 've been out for two and a half years , and we 've got about another two and a half years yet to go .
everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion .
nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million .
this is an aerial picture we did this year .
that 's what you see with these cameras .
on up to iceland .
you can see this river being formed .
we go back a couple years in time .
we have some cameras on the south edge of the ilulissat , watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat .
icebergs , many , many , many , many times the size of this building , are roaring out to sea .
okay , how big was that ? it 's hard to get it .
in back of me is a picture of me when i was 17 .
most people believed it was proteins .
but wilkins , you know , thought dna was the best bet , and he showed this x-ray photograph .
so i went to cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography . and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
if dna is that important , linus will know it .
and we knew it was big because , you know , if you just put a next to t and g next to c , you have a copying mechanism .
and you copy it by going from strand-separating .
and i 'm smiling , sort of forced , i think , because the girl i had , boy , she was gone .
so there , that 's what chris wanted me to do , it was — so what happened since then ?
( laughter ) and so dna did n't become a useful molecule , and the lawyers did n't enter into the equation until 1973 , 20 years later , when boyer and cohen in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna , and stanford patented it and made a lot of money .
and so i 'll go on . i 'm already out of time , but this is michael wigler , a very , very clever mathematician turned physicist . and he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample dna and , eventually , a million spots along it .
there 's a chip there , a conventional one . then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen , which is way ahead of affymetrix .
and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture . but as you can see , there 's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high .
and yet , in the controls there were three .
or , you know , were they normal ? i would guess they 're normal .
now , some people who think they 're right-handed are genetically left-handed . ok. i 'm just saying that , if you think , oh , i do n't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my , you know , children wo n't be at risk of schizophrenia . you might . ok ?
we ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar ; there 's a relationship .
older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain .
what i want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion , an illusion that history , our personal history , has just come to an end , that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives .
everybody here holds all of them , but you probably know that as you grow , as you age , the balance of these values shifts .
now it 's not just values . it 's all sorts of other things .
is this just a form of mis-prediction that does n't have consequences ?
no , it matters quite a bit , and i 'll give you an example of why .
now , in a perfectly rational world , these should be the same number , but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability .
`` sorry , when people say `` '' i ca n't imagine that , '' '' they 're usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they 're describing . ''
it alters our personalities .
it 's a watershed on the timeline .
thank you .
well , this is n't exactly true .
the frontispiece of this article was this photo , and i 'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker , because this photo completely rocked my world .
the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the bastille .
i bought some super sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
it 's exactly how i made my living for 15 years .
so , i started looking at the best photos i could find .
and tap plastics made me — although i did n't photograph it — a museum vitrine .
again , like i said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
and then there is this fourth level , which is a whole new object in the world : the prop made for the movie , the representative of the thing , becomes , in its own right , a whole other thing , a whole new object of desire .
i 'd bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the maltese falcon on ebay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
it was made out of resin , which was n't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made .
so what i did was , again , like i did with the dodo skull , i blew all my reference up to full size , and then i began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references .
as i moved through , i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon .
and i 'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i 'm holding the light in the same position , i 'm getting the same type of reflection on it — that 's the level of detail i 'm going into this thing .
this is where it gets weird .
terrifying guy — agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia .
it 's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum , and it 's people who trade , make and travel in information about movie props .
and it turned out that one of the guys there , a friend of mine that i never actually met , but befriended through some prop deals , was the manager of a local foundry .
here , i 'm going to put it out there , later on tonight , and i want you to pick it up and handle it .
that 's half the weight of my dog , huxley .
but there 's a problem .
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography master of this , which i will polish , then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze . or : there are several people who own originals , and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner
now , the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for , because 94 percent of federal it projects are over budget or behind schedule .
they are completely scrapped or abandoned .
and when the status quo is the riskiest option , that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption .
how do we fix this ?
well , the irony of all of this is that we actually do n't have to look any further than our backyard , because right here in america are the very ideas , the very people , who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago .
the mission of the united states digital service is to help government deliver world-class digital services for students , immigrants , children , the elderly — everybody — at dramatically lower costs .
think about what airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment .
( applause ) the best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it 's working out in the wild .
the first one is about immigration .
sadly , that 's what often happens .
the first one , this is the form i-90 .
so our team released a very easy , simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare , to help ease their nerves , to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream .
far too often , product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user , but they 're not necessarily the users themselves .
i 'm proud to say that they are live on the site today , and as the team continues to streamline more services , they will be ported over here , and the old sites , shut down .
when you walk out of the oval office , the first time i was ever there , i noticed a quote the president had embroidered on the rug .
we have the tools to solve these problems .
yes , it 's hard .
our government is us .
again , we 're seeing that trend across europe , across north america .
and in europe , there 's certain parts of europe , where we 're seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects .
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes , premature puberty .
and you can see these large , yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male 's testes .
but what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme , the machinery if you will , aromatase , that converts testosterone into estrogen .
now what 's interesting is , of course , that we 're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine , the number one contaminant in drinking water , that does the opposite — turns on aromatase , increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors , breast cancer , in humans .
and what 's interesting about bpa is that it 's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy .
for those of you who do n't know , we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
and as a result , when those rats grow up , their pups experience retarded growth and development because they ca n't make enough milk to nourish their pups .
in addition to that , after the baby 's born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they 're born .
pjc : it 's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this .
we are in effect polluting our children .
and the frogs that are exposed to atrazine , the testes are full of holes and spaces , because the hormone imbalance , instead of allowing sperm to be generated , such as in the testis here , the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent .
these are just men who live in an agricultural community .
they 're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin , which was originally used as a nerve gas .
now if i told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes , the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear .
pjc : so it does n't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue .
we know so much about global warming and climate change , and yet , we have no concept of what i 've been calling internal environmentalism .
and it 's my feeling and it 's my urging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communicators of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , bearing the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it 's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world .
so richard ledgett is the 15th deputy director of the national security agency , and he 's a senior civilian officer there , acts as its chief operating officer , guiding strategies , setting internal policies , and serving as the principal advisor to the director .
they 're all great citizens .
( ca and rl speaking at once ) he had the option to go to congressional committees , and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place , and so he did n't do any of those things .
i mean , in that circumstance , could n't you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
i think that the — sorry , i 'm getting feedback through the microphone there — the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that he put people 's lives at risk , basically , in the long run , and i know there 's been a lot of talk in public by mr. snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk , and that is categorically not true .
i think that 's extremely arrogant on his part .
that 's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security .
every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security , and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they 're operating in russia or the u.k .
`` and so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as `` '' you ca n't trust company a because your privacy is suspect with them '' '' is actually only accurate in the sense that it 's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world . ''
how do you characterize the american citizen 's right to privacy ?
first , we 're all in the same network .
ca : what about foreigners using american companies ' internet services ?
rl : i do n't really understand that argument .
rl : i think terrorism is still number one .
you 've got places like iraq , which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence , again a breeding ground for terrorism .
again , lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity .
it took down about 35,000 of their computers with a wiper-style virus .
that 's hard work . that 's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another , through law enforcement , through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action .
you think about on television , you watch a murder mystery .
on the other , the non-u.s.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the prism program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
rl : yeah .
and it 's important to note that the programs that we 're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents , two different political parties , by congress twice , and by federal judges 16 different times , and so this is not nsa running off and doing its own thing .
so again , we eat our own dog food .
ca : edward snowden , when , after his talk , was wandering the halls here in the bot , and i heard him say to a couple of people , they asked him about what he thought of the nsa overall , and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you , said that it 's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing , and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies .
would you accept that at least , even if you disagree with how he did it , that he has opened a debate that matters ?
do you still think that ?
this is something that the attorney general of the united states and the president also actually have both talked about this , and i defer to the attorney general , because this is his lane .
that 's not an nsa thing .
ca : rick , when ed snowden ended his talk , i offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid .
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .
they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them .
that 's the cheetah generation , and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs .
( laughter ) there are certain things that we need to recognize .
let 's take food imports .
let 's move on , and flip over to the next chapter , and that 's what this conference is all about — the next chapter .
`` ( laughter ) i belong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , `` '' since 1960 , we 've had exactly 204 african heads of state , since 1960 . '' '' and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders , just 20 good leaders — you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself . ''
everybody mentioned nelson mandela , of course .
kwame nkrumah , nyerere , kenyatta — somebody mentioned idi amin .
my point is , they could n't go beyond 15 .
`` there is one particular quote — a lesotho chief once said that `` '' here in lesotho , we 've got two problems : rats and the government . '' '' ( laughter ) what you and i understand as a government does n't exist in many african countries . ''
there is the modern sector , there is the informal sector and the traditional sector .
it 's dysfunctional .
first one is the political system .
now , compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa .
it 's owned by extended families .
they decide what to do .
and when they produce their crops , they sell the surplus on marketplaces .
when they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them .
so , in a nutshell , what we had in traditional africa was a free-market system .
timbuktu was one great big market town .
he 's getting no assistance from the government , and he 's building a second , bigger boat .
it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians .
we have now entered in the 6x , the sixth major extinction on this planet .
i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium .
we have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants , mitigated by the mcyelium — so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks , cedars and douglas firs .
dusty and i , we like to say , on sunday , this is where we go to church .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
it inhales oxygen , just like we do .
most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land .
this was first discovered in 1859 .
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
how is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham , washington .
these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box — you 're gon na be getting a dvd of the ted conference — you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
now , three corncobs , no other grain — lots of mushrooms begin to form .
and so i thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
now four years ago , i injured my foot in a climbing accident and i went to the doctor .
`` he looked me in the face and he said , `` take off your shoe and give me your machete . '' ''
the pain disappeared for seven months .
here you see a medicine man in the northeast amazon treating leishmaniasis , a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world .
this is the magic frog .
it was later developed into ace inhibitors .
hypertension causes over 10 percent of all deaths on the planet every day .
this is a $ 4 billion industry based on venom from a brazilian snake , and the brazilians did not get a nickel .
these are the people who know nature best .
the akuriyos have 35 words for honey , and other indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm .
here you see the face of my friend pohnay .
each of these dots represents a small , uncontacted tribe , and the big reveal today is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups in the colombian amazon alone .
why are these people isolated ?
they know we exist , they know there 's an outside world .
this is a form of resistance .
even today , when people come out of the forest , the story seldom has a happy ending .
no scientist has been atop them .
in fact , nobody has been atop the bell mountain since schultes in '43 .
of course , when you give them clothes , when you give them tools , you also give them diseases .
let 's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation , in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation , can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose .
any of you who 've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you , there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you 're in trouble .
and i 'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans .
he taught mechanics in a high school in long beach , and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems .
now jpl , nasa and boeing , before they will hire a research and development problem solver — even if they 're summa cum laude from harvard or cal tech — if they have n't fixed cars , have n't done stuff with their hands early in life , played with their hands , they ca n't problem-solve as well .
now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration . ( laughter ) but it has to be safe exploration .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts — cognitive , emotional and physical — that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
i love this picture because my daughter , who 's now almost 40 , is in this picture , but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination , her ability to spin yarns at this age — preschool .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you 're experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you 're experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they 're hardwired to flee and hide .
and you can trust it .
you may not know this word , but it should be your biological first name and last name .
those of you who remember al gore , during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency , may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person , at least in public .
so what i would encourage on an individual level to do , is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear , joyful , playful image that you have , whether it 's with a toy , on a birthday or on a vacation .
so we 've had brendan , who 's from ideo , and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom .
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
narrator : flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing .
attendees at meetings do n't know when they 'll get back to the task that they left at their desk .
sb : yeah , i do n't think that 's accurate , and i think probably because animals have taught us that .
and if you imagine a kid pretending to be king kong , or a race car driver , or a fireman , they do n't all become race car drivers or firemen , you know .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
and women share the same distribution as well , but actually there 's quite a big difference .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
it 's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one i 'll show you are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology .
put your hand up if you think they 're saying hello .
so if you did n't do that well on this , maybe you are not a very visual type of person .
if you said b , it means you 're an auditory learner , that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format .
no . what you need to do is match the material to be learned to the presentation format , not you .
i know many of you are a-level students that will have recently gotten your gcse results .
that said , it is of course true that most of us do n't use our brainpower quite as well as we could .
so the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary i.q . boost on a narrow range of tasks .
a famous study surveyed people from [ 37 ] different cultures across the globe , from americans to zulus , on what they look for in a partner .
the myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks , americans call them , or purple patches , we sometimes say in england , where they just ca n't miss , like this guy here .
but in fact , what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically , it turns out that it 's nearly always at random .
this idea , the effect that punishment can improve performance , is what participants thought they were testing in milgram 's famous learning and punishment experiment that you 've probably heard about if you 're a psychology student .
`` so , for example , they might say `` '' taken from us '' '' rather than `` '' killed . '' '' speaking of which , it 's about time i killed this talk , but before i do , i just want to give you in 30 seconds the overarching myth of psychology . ''
( applause )
so , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
in colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
they 've leapfrogged .
`` so we 're once again doing `` '' give one , get one . '' '' last year , we ran a `` '' give one , get one '' '' program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free . ''
you vaccinate all the children in an area .
it 's a great pleasure to be here .
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
now , the small hadron collider is in a cupboard , overlooked and neglected .
what brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves , and that 's why it 's so valuable .
so the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see .
this is a place called monkey hill .
that name should tell you that the kenyan education system borrows almost everything from britain , circa 1950 , but has managed to make it even worse .
that 's where maureen went to school .
they 're private schools . there are no state schools in slums .
they are to stay alive , to earn a living , to not become hiv positive .
it 's not to do with electricity or water .
it 's the mobile phone .
if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa , you would start now with the mobile phone .
the remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married .
you can go to places like this .
many of them do n't have electricity at home .
and so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this .
you need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings .
and so you attract people through that into learning , not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you 've eaten your cognitive greens .
well , you create your own teachers .
it has 30,000 children on those building sites .
and i learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
these people work with the chinese restaurant model — same principles , different applications and different settings — not the mcdonald 's model .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
of 14 of them , only two of them are in schools .
most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
we need more of that completely new and radical thinking .
and of course it will bring great things .
it will lay waste to appetite . it will lay waste to social confidence .
and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform .
`` he called out one word in the darkness : `` bye . '' ''
there 's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school , or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts .
today , i 'm here to share the experience of what it 's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts .
i did n't know about any of this until months after his death .
i 'm trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder .
many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated .
too often , they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis .
she assured me that a mother 's love was the strongest bond on earth , and that she loved her children more than anything in the world , but because of her illness , she was sure that they would be better off without her .
their thinking is impaired and they 've lost access to tools of self-governance .
i wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal .
and somehow , 17 years and many school shootings later , it 's still appallingly easy .
the second round started six years after the shootings , when i was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide for the first time at a conference .
the attacks happened everywhere : in the hardware store , in my office , or even while reading a book in bed .
my mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how i hard i tried to calm myself down or reason my way out of it , i could n't do it .
i know that i will live with this tragedy , with these multiple tragedies , for the rest of my life .
in the end what i know comes down to this : the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help , but for love 's sake , we must never stop trying to know the unknowable .
thank you .
and even with that , my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis .
we would retire and i would go off into the sunset , maybe do ministry full time , love my wife a long time .
and so now , over the next 19 months , i shifted , and i transcended from being a drug sergeant — ready to retire as a drug sergeant — and went from level to level to level , until i find myself as a district commander , commander of the worst district in baltimore city .
the top 10 — i did n't say state , i did n't say city — that little neighborhood .
we still did it because we listened to that inner spirit , because i realized this : if i was to see real police reform in the communities that i had authority over for public safety , we had to change our stinkin ' thinkin ' .
`` we said , `` '' this is your community table . ''
`` what 's going to work in your community ? '' '' and then some great things started to happen . ''
i had to figure out how to do that .
but we have exercised that arm so much , so very much .
no fat on it . mmm it look good . it just look good !
and we 've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve .
you know , it 's kinda weak .
it 's withering and it 's dying because we 've invested so much in our protective arm .
too much .
it was the parental figures in the community .
they shifted from that and became commuter churches .
i could go on and on , but i really need to wrap this up .
it 's not somebody else 's fault — it 's all of our fault .
you see , after three years
we knew there was sickness in our community and they did n't have access to proper medical care , so we 'd partner up .
but i got ta tell you this : these last few years , as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive , these last years have disappointed me .
i 'm excited again , because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing , but he absolutely understands it , and more importantly , he embraces it .
i believe — i truly believe — ( applause ) that we will be great again .
we all want respect for one another .
and there 's another reason we should go : exploration is in our dna .
and they prospered doing that .
the biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to mars .
so getting to mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ...
how soon will the first humans actually land here ?
and here 's what you need to live on mars : all of the above , plus oxygen .
so let 's look at the most important thing on this list first .
and nasa has figured this one out , too .
and finally there 's clothing .
on earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us , which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times , and we 're constantly pushing out against that .
it will keep us together , block radiation and keep us warm .
so let 's think about this for a minute .
we really can .
so that leads to the next big — really big step — in living the good life on mars .
if we heat it up , it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on earth .
right now , on a perfect day at the equator , in the middle of summer on mars , temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees , but then they go down to minus 100 at night .
then we get some real magic .
but what would you do there ? how would you live ?
hans rosling : i 'm going to ask you three multiple choice questions .
the first question is , how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster , how did that change during the last century ?
please answer a , b or c .
oh , very , very good .
a , b or c ? please answer .
and we go to the next question .
did it almost double , did it remain more or less the same , or did it halve ?
in 1900 , there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters : floods , earthquakes , volcanic eruption , whatever , droughts .
and then , how did that change ?
the world has been much , much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this , you know .
this is the u.s. public .
well , congratulations , you 're twice as good as the swedes , but you do n't need me — so how come ? i think it 's like this , that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties .
well , it 's very clear that poverty here was almost halved , and in u.s. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
and you ?
look at the swedish result : you know what the right answer is .
`` `` '' i bet no member of the media passed the test , '' '' he said . ''
but first , let 's look at why are we so ignorant , and it all starts in this place .
unusual events are more interesting , no ?
so i 've started actually contacting some of them , like wwf and amnesty international and unicef , and asking them , what are your favorite facts which you think the public does n't know ?
okay , i gather those facts .
people do n't have that time .
let 's start with the first misconception .
yeah , it 's an unequal world , but when you look at the data , it 's one hump .
no — well , yes , but they are not so important in the global statistics , that is what i 'm saying .
of course there are dangerous things that are also great .
sharks kill very , very few . that 's how you should think .
the western domination is over , as of today .
i did a little experiment . i went to the imf , international monetary fund , website .
you were the better at spend and spend ; i was the better at grubbing and heaping , but who was the better man in the end ?
you were the better at rolling a reefer , i was the better at coke and rum ; remember that night on the beach in ibiza ?
my mother was certainly the most important in mine .
never succumb to the gorgon 's stare .
never surrender the future you earned .
never look back . never look back .
`` `` to a beautiful lady of a certain age . '' ''
count thy sheep and not thy years .
time rules all , my dearest .
youth can never come again ; we have drunk the summer wine .
do i shrink from thy caress ?
if americans are so fat , stupid and ignorant , my dear friends from birmingham , how come they rule the world ?
the worship of those we hate .
aye , that it does .
love came to visit me , shy as a fawn .
comrades and enemies fled from its wrath .
i 'm not an evil man .
i 'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman , who men fall down , you know , when she walks in a room .
my friends , human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor — probably it was my ancestor — got his hands around the neck of the last neanderthal , and battered the bastard to death .
oh , we did .
and i am as bad as you .
one of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours .
a generous mistress whom many loved much .
many there were , to covet her kiss .
and the reason i really like these goals is that there are eight of them .
here you see the data .
what is the origin of the data ?
we have interviews , we have surveys .
how many children did you have ?
but watch out — they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
and i was sad , because we could see this reversal in kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s .
this was the estimate of the new survey .
i was actually , on friday , sitting in front of my computer , and i saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .
so we celebrated .
i would say , at least do this — 10 years is enough to follow the trend .
so look at the average here — this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .
so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
in the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
and then , you see , these were famine years .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
but look , the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast .
you have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments .
and sweden never reached [ the ] millennium development goal rate , 3.1 percent when i calculated .
so we are off track — that 's what sweden is .
here we have a problem .
it got down there — china comes into the western box here .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
there we are today .
`` it 's very good — `` '' levels and trends in child mortality '' '' — except this page . ''
we have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
and the way to do that , that is to get child mortality down , get access to family planning and behind that drive female education .
thank you very much .
wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking .
i hope it 's a story i 'm reading for many years to come .
notably mars , as a first example .
because in the mid-1950s , when i was a tiny child , they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called sputnik , which sent the western world into a hysterical tailspin .
and a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
and that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective , to try to then think about the way our planet behaves , as a planet , and with the life that 's on it .
whether or not you think it 's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe .
certainly , in the last 15 years , we 've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed , and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the size-class of earth has actually been found .
of course , that official is now dead , and i 'm not , so there 's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries .
so , we know that it 's probably quite cryptic .
but the organisms that we work with , from the sub-surface of earth , very often it 's months — and in many cases , years — before we see any growth whatsoever .
there is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite — minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed — and it is a completely hostile environment for us .
so , it 's a very hazardous environment , with co as well , and many other gases .
these extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special .
this is very unusual for caves .
this is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through .
and every time they do that , they get a tiny little packet of energy .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
we face the problem of , how can we do this robotically ?
and the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on mars .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
ma : i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story .
julian treasure : i call this the mixer .
daniel wolpert : feeling everything that 's going on inside my body .
when i was first asked to speak at ted , i was n't quite sure what my angle was , at first , so yeah , i immediately started watching tons of ted talks , which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode , thinking , i have n't mounted a successful expedition to the north pole yet .
see , 30 years ago , you had the first digital samplers , and they changed everything overnight .
`` over the next 10 years , `` '' la di da di '' '' continues to be sampled by countless records , ending up on massive hits like `` '' here comes the hotstepper '' '' and `` '' i wan na sex you up . '' '' snoop doggy dogg covers this song on his debut album `` '' doggystyle '' '' and calls it `` '' lodi dodi . '' '' copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point . ''
these records do n't really age that well .
so i would like to do one more piece that i put together for you tonight , and it takes place with two pretty inspiring ted performances that i 've seen .
let 's hear that ted sound again , right ?
silence , in terms of citizens not engaging , simply not wanting to participate .
there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly , truly dislike , and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic . that we shun commitment .
our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called democracyos .
it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement .
but , it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick .
and i must be honest : i think , in hindsight , we were .
`` of course , our elected representatives are not saying , `` '' yes , we 're going to vote according to what citizens decide , '' '' but they 're willing to try . ''
our political system can be transformed , and not by subverting it , by destroying it , but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now .
and , though it seems really simple , it 's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
sound familiar ? right .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
you may be asking yourself , is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st-century leader ?
i noticed that , despite all the efforts , there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals .
why are the leadership gaps widening when there 's so much more investment in leadership development ?
and what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow ?
and then , when i returned to work full time , in this role , i joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions .
who are you spending time with ? on what topics ?
they see around corners , shaping their future , not just reacting to it .
the second question is , what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network ?
a ted medley — a tedley .

this could be us .
and these things are so exciting . they are so often the only , or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains .
it essentially runs up from the gulf of aden , or runs down to lake malawi .
if you want to become a fossil , you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried .
and we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains , and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story .
so , let 's go to lake turkana , which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country , kenya .
that 's what we 're still trying to find answers to , and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species , and our ancestors are no exception .
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well , because i was the same age that he was when he died .
he had a body very similar to our own , and he was on the threshold of becoming human .
we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors .
i think it 's our collective intelligence .
but what 's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolutionarily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
i 'm going to talk today about saving more , but not today , tomorrow .
two years ago , three years ago , about four years ago , markets did well .
anyone ? wonderful .
what if you lose your iphone ?
anyone ?
we 're not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
how do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make , and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions ?
they can not make savings easy .
what about the remaining half of the people ?
how many people end up saving to a 401 ( k ) plan ?
take out those who say they save too little .
what does it have to do with time and savings , this issue of immediate gratification ?
or as some economists call it , present bias .
`` and in germany , if you would like to donate your organs — god forbid something really bad happens to you — when you get your driving license or an i.d. , you check the box saying , `` i would like to donate my organs . '' ''
it takes effort . you need to think .
well , you still have choice .
in austria , again , nobody checks the box .
therefore , 99 percent of people are organ donors .
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep procrastinating , if they do n't check the boxes ?
so we 've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges .
no , no , no , this is a real study and it 's got a lot to do with behavioral economics .
saving more today is not an option .
we 're seeing here a three and a half-year period , four pay raises , people who were struggling to save , were saving three percent of their paycheck , three and a half years later saving almost four times as much , almost 14 percent .
by now , about 60 percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place .
it 's been part of the pension protection act .
anyone heard of it ?
now this region 's very diverse , and every country is unique .
but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today .
so after analyzing mounds of data , what we discovered was this : unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the arab revolts of 2011 .
now this is very unusual , because globally we find that , not surprisingly , people feel better as their country gets richer .
it actually got harder .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who 've revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
what about men 's views of religion and law ?
from wall street to mohammed mahmoud street , it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people .
audience : yes .
when i conduct this experiment , a bunch of stuff comes up : vast wealth , trophy spouse , good health , lots of travel , time , etc , etc , etc .
where does that leave you ?
not a very nice place , right ?
i have a different proposition to suggest to you .
a mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works .
maybe a rainbow , a mountain range , a valley , the sea .
i 'd like to share with you that action .
the outcome is completely out of your control .
and this was his way of showing , you know , i care for you , and nice things would happen .
you 've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted ?
true ? false ?
there is an alternative .
i do n't know how many of you are familiar with john wooden .
`` but i would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of , you will find the score to your liking . '' '' that is investing in a process . ''
investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being .
have you ever seen a small child learn to walk ?
after some time , mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying , and then she gets up , takes a step and does n't fall down , and then she takes another , and a beautiful smile comes on her face .
`` now , imagine what would happen if each time the child fell , she would say , `` '' oh my god , i failed again . ''
`` the question that i get all the time , is people say , `` '' professor rao , but nothing makes me passionate . '' '' so i say , `` '' ok , what would ? '' '' and they invariably come up with , you know , here is a list of things . ''
but if you do find a way to ignite it where you are , then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming .
time is . time has come . ' 'white is leaving , ' steve said somberly .
schizophrenia is a brain disease .
`` loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but do n't make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it 's called `` '' word salad . '' '' contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality . ''
but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status , and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities .
and then , late on a friday night , on the roof of the yale law school , i began to sing , and not quietly either .
back inside , i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was .
'i think someone 's infiltrated my copies of the cases , ' i said .
`` then the sound came again , forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw . '' '' this incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization . ''
all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
once in his office , i sat on his couch , folded over , and began muttering .
hundreds of thousands with thoughts , interdiction . ' 'elyn , do you feel like you 're dangerous to yourself or others ?
forgive me , for i know not what i do . ' eventually , i broke down in front of friends , and everybody convinced me to take more medication .
these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth , and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms .
the better we understand these illnesses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
the poet rainer maria rilke was offered psychoanalysis .
now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries .
an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it .
and then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagnosis , and then prescribes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glasses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree .
they receive comprehensive eye exams .
and the second year went up to 75 percent .
so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market , because it focused on the non-customer , and then by reaching the unreached , we 're able to significantly grow the market .
so what is in this video is a surgeon operating , and then you see on the other side , another patient is getting ready .
( applause ) this is a very busy table , but what this really is conveying is that , when it comes to quality , we have put in very good quality-assurance systems .
and , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .
( applause ) but this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness .
what it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the uk does , near a half-million surgeries as a whole country .
it is ourselves we are healing .
we will see 30,000 new infected websites .
right ? well , actually , statistically speaking , if you only visit porn sites , you 're safer .
today 's cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
well , many of you have the image , do n't you , of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement , hacking away for notoriety .
`` maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , `` '' hi , i 'm a nigerian banker , and i 'd like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . '' '' or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china 's recent campaign against america . ''
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
well , you could try looking really cute .
that can be very embarrassing .
let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
and it 's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
it creates some very serious alerts .
`` down below , highlighted in red , in the other section of source code , is this bit `` '' leded : leded . '' '' that 's a username , kind of like you might have on twitter . ''
and you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image .
it turns out he 's a member of the russian adult webmasters federation .
and herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now .
this is mobsoft , one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned , and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50-percent owner of this posted a job advert , and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier .
this woman was maria , and maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals .
now you 're probably wondering what happened to these guys .
let me come back to that in just a minute .
ciasurveillancevan .
this is n't an exact science , but it gets pretty accurate .
your wireless network name is so unique that i was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the internet with no hacking or clever , clever tricks .
`` and i should mention as well that some of you do use your names , `` '' james lyne 's iphone , '' '' for example . ''
you 're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying , scary things .
however , 99 percent of it works because people fail to do the basics .
let me give you just a story , an example .
that 's walking abraham 's path .
but like me , they are human beings .
this gives me the chance to get access to people , to stories that others ca n't .
so , no male journalists get the story .
one of the times in gaza , during the kidnapping of the british journalist alan johnston , i was asked by an american magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in gaza , and i did .
and they drove us away , far away in the middle of a field .
i love my country , despite the terrible situation we live in — siege , poverty , unemployment — but there is life .
but when i hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing , i just head straight toward it , because i want to be there first , because these stories should be told .
and the funny thing is they call me mr. rambo in gaza .
( applause )
so that said , there 's a stigma when you have brain surgery .
but luckily , i 'm an experimentalist at heart , so i decided i would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really is n't a clear road map on this that 's detailed .
and i think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key metric — how to get these mental images that i use as a way of rapid prototyping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scenarios .
this kind of thinking is n't new .
both used fmri technology — functional magnetic resonance imaging technology — to image the brain , and here is a brain scan set from giorgio ganis and his colleagues at harvard .
and the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image .
so let me set this up for you .
then a new movie was shown with new images , new people , new animals in it , and a new scan set was recorded .
it might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills .
as a born-in-the-mid-1960s gen x-er , hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday , i 'm naturally inclined to pessimism . but working at worldchanging has convinced me , much to my own surprise , that successful responses to the world 's problems are nonetheless possible .
as a small example , many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency .
data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions , or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps , allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all .
the political aspects of mobile phones ca n't be ignored either , from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government , to the blairwatch project in the uk , keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .
and i 'm just incredibly happy to see the news that witness is going to be opening up a web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the internet , rather than just hand-carrying the videotape .
`` it would be , in essence , an `` '' earth witness '' '' project . ''
`` it could just as easily be called , `` '' environmental transparency project , '' '' `` '' smart mobs for natural security '' '' — but earth witness is a lot easier to say . ''
that 's understandable and important .
and for a lot of us , they 're as close as we have yet to always-on , widely available information tools .
now , the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new : phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath , or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure .
swedish firm uppsala biomedical , more seriously , makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field , uploading the data , displaying the results .
now , there 's an enormous variety of tiny , inexpensive sensors on the market , and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature , co2 or methane levels , the presence of some biotoxins — potentially , in a few years , maybe even h5n1 avian flu virus .
and most important , you ca n't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth .
it felt a bit girly to me , like a dress , and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down .
what makes us who we are anyway ?
hp : ( in chinese ) yr : i used to read spider-man comics , watch kung fu movies , take philosophy lessons from bruce lee .
now you put water into a cup .
( laughter ) yr : good advice , but i still think that we learn who we are by copying others .
i have .
i even started to get discounts in indian shops .
when i had learned this phrase , i had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded .
every time i fail to become bruce lee , i become more authentically me .
( laughter ) thank you .
but he should , because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers .
diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide , and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv/aids or t.b . or measles , but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together .
and the cost to the world is immense : 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation .
child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history .
it 's a wonderful waste disposal device .
but i think that it 's so good — it does n't smell , we can put it in our house , we can lock it behind a door — and i think we 've locked it out of conversation too .
no one 's going to refuse clean water .
and i understand that . who can blame them ?
they 're cutting down on deforestation , and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible , infinite and free at the point of production .
here 's a woman who 's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes , which is what you think it is , except not quite , because it 's actually donated .
maybe it 's the ick factor .
so you 'd be thinking by now , okay , the solution 's simple , we give everyone a toilet .
they tried selling it as sexy . everyone bought it .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law 's house .
and she was horrified to get there and find that they did n't have a toilet .
after three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
and if you know anything about rural india , you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do .
her entire life , she 'd been using the banana field behind , but she installed the latrine in a few hours .
it 's about 50 or so years off track .
we 're not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
all we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent , shameful issue that it is .
things are going wrong here too .
this is a picture of culture .
two farmers , thomas lee and tinie causby , who raised chickens , had a significant complaint because of these technologies .
well , the supreme court considered this 100-years tradition and said , in an opinion written by justice douglas , that the causbys must lose .
finally . before the internet , the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology . broadcasting : a new way to spread content , and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content .
and in 1939 , a lawyer , sydney kaye , started something called broadcast music inc. we know it as bmi .
my first love ...
no one else will do ...
they tell me how much you care ...
one side builds new technologies , such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like youtube any content that has any copyrighted content in it , whether or not there 's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content .
and on the other side , among our kids , there 's a growing copyright abolitionism , a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible .
and the solution here , in my view , is a private solution , a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again , and to realize the economic potential of that , and that 's where the story of bmi becomes relevant .
it 's the point about how this connects to our kids .
and in a democracy , we ought to be able to do better .
i 've been working with plastic bags , which i cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years .
`` and i thought , `` '' great . ''
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .
i was n't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean — of which i have learned there are now 11 gyres , potentially , of plastic in five major oceans in the world .
`` another thing that we 're looking at and asking people to think about is we 've added a fourth r onto the front of the `` '' reduce , reuse , recycle , '' '' three r 's , and that is refuse . ''
mike brown .
so let 's continue .
what you may not know is that the other list is also african-americans who have been killed within the last two years .
i 've done it even with progressive members of congress .
these women 's names have slipped through our consciousness because there are no frames for us to see them , no frames for us to remember them , no frames for us to hold them .
as a consequence , reporters do n't lead with them , policymakers do n't think about them , and politicians are n't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them .
so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself ?
i would go on to learn that african-american women , like other women of color , like other socially marginalized people all over the world , were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of intersectionality , intersections of race and gender , of heterosexism , transphobia , xenophobia , ableism , all of these social dynamics come together and create challenges that are sometimes quite unique .
police violence against black women is very real .
they 've been killed in their living rooms , in their bedrooms .
they 've been killed on the street .
they 've been killed in front of their parents and they 've been killed in front of their children .
they have been manhandled to death .
they 've been killed shopping while black , driving while black , having a mental disability while black , having a domestic disturbance while black .
why do n't we know these stories ?
so what can we do ?
we 're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal abby dobson .
thank you for joining us .
so before i show you the rest of the world , what does this mean for germany ?
so i would say it depends .
we looked at the gdp and productivity growth of germany over the last 20 years , and calculated the following scenario : if germany wants to continue this gdp and productivity growth , we could directly calculate how many people germany would need to support this growth .
now , the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology .
let 's take germany again .
( laughter ) that was 1998 .
sixteen years later , you 'd probably say the opposite .
are they actually willing to work abroad ?
more than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers are willing to work abroad .
workforce planning will become more important than financial planning .
there 's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us .
( applause )
do you rip it off quickly — short duration but high intensity — or do you take your band-aid off slowly — you take a long time , but each second is not as painful — which one of those is the right approach ?
this is not just in hebrew , by the way .
and , you know , there 's not much — there was n't much i could do , and they kept on doing what they were doing .
i was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients .
i moved to sounds , electrical shocks — i even had a pain suit that i could get people to feel much more pain .
and here 's how it went .
i would pass their sheet of paper .
now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
and you weigh these options out — you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
again , a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit , and they were insensitive to these economic incentives .
on the other hand , we can cheat a little bit , and still feel good about ourselves .
now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments — and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments — but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
`` now , ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , `` why do n't we get people to sign the honor code ? '' ''
and this is particularly interesting , because mit does n't have an honor code .
in contrast , i took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and i left those plates in the same refrigerators .
the same thing happens .
`` that 's it . the task is finished . '' '' so , now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group . ''
will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing .
`` ( laughter ) now , this is important , because remember , when the moment the student stood up , it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating , because the experimenter said , `` '' you 've finished everything . go home , '' '' and they went with the money . ''
so it was n't so much about the probability of being caught again .
what happens when you do other things , like you remove things from money ?
could it be that with those more distant things , it 's not a token for one second , it 's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time — could it be that people will cheat even more ?
the question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
`` but it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , `` '' i did not think that your intuition was right . ''
`` i felt my intuition was correct . '' '' so , if you think about all of your intuitions , it 's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong . ''
now , a decade later , it 's really time to push the envelope a little bit , and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child , and we launched buzzcar a year ago .
it 's like saying yard sales are the same thing as ebay , or craft fairs are the same thing as etsy .
i call this peers , inc .
what do they bring ? they bring this fabulous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
it delivers localization and customization , specialization , and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there ?
some of my favorite examples : in transportation , carpooling.com . ten years old , three and a half million people have joined up , and a million rides are shared every day .
when i talked to their ceo , he had this great line .
etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace .
there are many , many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example : insurance .
all the drivers are becoming members . it 's excellent .
`` a driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them , and said , `` '' you know what , here 's where the cliffs are , and here 's all the beaches , and this is my best beach , and this is where the best fish restaurant is . '' '' and the peers also become , peers and owners create relationships , and so at the last minute people can — a driver can say , `` '' hey , you know what , i really need the car , is it available ? '' '' and that person will say , `` sure , my wife 's at home . go pick up the keys . go do it . '' ''
rating agencies are rating companies .
they are rating banks .
they are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities .
and i can tell , as you 're listening to me right now , you 're thinking , so why should i really care about this , right ?
well , ratings affect you .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
it would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment .
we need to look for something else , and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut .
`` it 's called `` '' bloom , '' '' and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal , and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things . one , it 's a sun-shading device , so that when the sun hits the surface , it constricts the amount of sun passing through , and in other areas , it 's a ventilating system , so that hot , trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary . ''
and so you see here some early studies of blocks , where those holes are actually coming through , and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied , and this is after the bimetal is applied . sorry , it 's a little hard to see , but on the surfaces , you can see these red arrows .
and of course , there 's been economic growth in the west .
so this is where they are today .
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
well , i 'm going to project into 2050 .
this is what we will find there .
and let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
but it 's a very important role .
or they 'll just take a superficial , one-off approach , hoping that they can return back to business as usual as soon as the crisis is over .
in order to get test scores to go up , teachers will end up teaching to the test .
so given these obstacles , what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations so rather than being exhausting , it 's actually empowering and energizing ?
most transformations have financial and operational goals .
you need to go all in .
because of these investments , rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation , chronos employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles .
in a transformation , a leader needs to have a vision , a clear road map with milestones , and then you need to hold people accountable for results .
in other words , you need to be directive .
the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship .
it was the idea of his 28-year-old assistant , nick u'ren .
john hockenberry : it 's great to be here with you , tom .
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other .
jh : is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
jh : because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise .
i want to just say — so this is jack , nick and louie .
( laughter ) jh : whoa . that is ...
and i keep it around for a couple of weeks , and i 'm contemplating it , and i 'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the depth of it .
and then when i did the second one , it really disturbed the piece — these big blue lines crashing through the center of it — and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap .
there are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes .
there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that i really enjoy .
some of these paintings , when you look at them very close , odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles , elephants .
all my creations really start on small drawings , which i have thousands of , and it 's my way of just thinking .
jh : so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces .
and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature , humans are of the universe .
the universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe .
tom , thank you so much . it 's been really , really great .
so in a single image , you can really see the scale of this event — just the number of people , the colors , the banners .
so in the protests , maybe you noticed , they flew over the river so it was quite safe .
for many good reasons , it 's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras .
you hear about people with google glass being attacked .
so this leash has some additional electronics .
you can turn it on .
so as i 'm watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
i 've taught myself to sew , cook , fix plumbing , build furniture , i can even pat myself on the back when necessary , all so i do n't have to ask anyone for anything .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people — they eat two , three , four dinners a night — it 's ridiculous !
this is the gay lifestyle .
and sometimes i just wear it just because .
`` and i said to myself , `` '' lz , for so long , you have been denied this . ''
some of you may be calling it , what , the constitution of the united states , is that what you call it too ?
and we 're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated , that we 've already agreed upon .
he has a 4.0 .
he prays before he eats .
it 's because of what the state of michigan says that i am that i am disqualified for any sort of adoption .
and so here we are , 2012 , gay agenda , gay lifestyle , and i 'm not a good dad and people do n't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are , not who they are .
over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
they 're essentially digital cameras .
( laughter ) you get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
and it 's in there that those mini-big bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
and by everything i mean , of course , me and you , the earth , the sun , the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
`` you know ? if you want to know what i 'm made of , let 's look at me . '' '' well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets hotter and hotter , denser and denser , and simpler and simpler . ''
it 's almost like ...
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
but you do n't feel them , because the weak force is correctly named — very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
`` so , one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university , ernest rutherford , discoverer of the atomic nucleus , once said , `` '' all science is either physics or stamp collecting . '' '' now , i do n't think he meant to insult the rest of science , although he was from new zealand , so it 's possible . ''
it 's called the standard model — beautifully simple mathematical equation .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything — other than gravity — that happens in the universe .
basically , each of these terms refers to some of the particles .
but they 're necessary : they 're necessary to make that mathematics work .
and the picture is that the whole universe — and that does n't mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you — the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field .
the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles .
if that picture 's true , then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc .
one of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature — it 's quite beautiful , actually — seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
well , they do change in strength .
the strong force , the strong nuclear force , which sticks nuclei together , gets weaker . and what you see is the standard model — you can calculate how these change — is the forces , the three forces , other than gravity , almost seem to come together at one point .
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
so , the right laws of physics — they 're beautifully balanced .
50 years ago , i could n't have told that story , because we did n't know it .
and i 'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
and in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality .
if you know about this trait , you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior .
you can understand why artists are so different from accountants .
so , right now , please raise your hand — down in the simulcast rooms , too , let 's let everybody see who 's here — please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center .
let 's start at the beginning .
we 're all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
the second foundation is fairness/reciprocity .
`` this norman rockwell painting is called `` '' the golden rule , '' '' and we heard about this from karen armstrong , of course , as the foundation of so many religions . ''
`` this painting is called `` '' the allegory of chastity , '' '' but purity 's not just about suppressing female sexuality . ''
`` in-group , authority , purity — this stuff has nothing to do with morality . i reject it . '' '' but as people get more conservative , the values rise . ''
in the first panel , we see the moment of creation .
all is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they 're supposed to be doing , where they 're supposed to be .
but then , given the way of the world , things change .
( laughter ) but the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more .
the truth of social entropy .
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
it 's not that complicated .
this is what 's really complicated , that there were people living in places like the grand canyon , cooperating with each other , or on the savannahs of africa , or on the frozen shores of alaska , and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of babylon , and rome , and tenochtitlan .
`` so as edmund burke said , `` '' the restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights . '' '' this was after the chaos of the french revolution . ''
yin and yang are n't enemies . yin and yang do n't hate each other .
`` from the zen master seng-ts'an : `` '' if you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against . ''
can you be not for or against anything ?
so , what 's the point ? what should you do ?
( applause )
well , we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home .
this is clay hunt . clay was a marine with me .
we 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
it 's like the land and the king ( i.e . arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one .
it was n't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines .
they also do n't understand time , but that 's a matter for a separate talk .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
and that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this .
the contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
this little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well .
if you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that .
it projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
there you are , swinging the sun around .
but it was that work that was seen by alex mcdowell , one of the world 's legendary production designers .
and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r & d effort .
and it 's fun to fly through mr. beckett 's eye .
and that 's all well and good .
let 's do something a little more difficult .
now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .
mind you , it 's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise , but we do it in the lab all the time .
and again , that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space .
and finally , i 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
this is a system called tamper , which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .
let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .
we wo n't have succeeded unless we take that next big step .
the gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
so , whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that 's not a killer app .
( laughter ) john , thank you for making science-fiction real .
i saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
i thought , maybe there 's some earthly basis for moral decisions .
so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold .
so i started smaller .
we give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them .
`` and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , `` '' do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? '' '' the trick is you ca n't see them , you ca n't talk to them . ''
and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
that 's not what we found .
but the second is that i still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .
so oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
we 've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
after they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
so i tend to avoid that .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we 're moral .
`` `` '' well this is very valuable . ''
`` i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i 've got to go . '' '' again he asked me , `` '' what do you think we should do ? '' '' i 'm in high school . i have no idea . ''
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and i was the pigeon .
so the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him , it 's that he shows he trusts the victim .
so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
and we have testosterone .
we do n't need god or government telling us what to do .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
her mother was number two .
then the groom 's father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends — arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun .
so even though i have a fear of heights , i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
and there are so many ways we can connect to people .
so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system .
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .
there you go . that 's connection .
so oxytocin connects us to other people .
come here . give me a hug .
and they 're happier because they have better relationships of all types .
there were waves of terror rolling across the globe .
we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations .
of course , i knew it was clear that religion would be a principle battlefield in this rapidly changing landscape , and it was already clear that religion was a significant part of the problem .
the question for me was , could religion also be part of the solution ?
it also looks like a couple inspired by the islamic state walking into an office party in san bernardino and killing 14 .
this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion and the future of faith .
well , religious ritual and rites were essentially designed to serve the function of the anniversary , to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants of that sacred , revelatory encounter that birthed the religion in the first place .
that 's when we find ourselves in endless , mindless repetitions of words that do n't mean anything to us , rising and being seated because someone has asked us to , holding onto jealously guarded doctrine that 's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality , engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that 's the way things have always been done .
i 'm going to share with you four of those commitments now .
we live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to information about every global tragedy that happens on every corner of this earth .
we all saw this picture .
`` my tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road when he sees a beautiful house on fire , and he says , `` '' how can it be that something so beautiful would burn , and nobody seems to even care ? '' '' so too we learn that our world is on fire , and it is our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open , and to recognize that it 's our responsibility to help put out the flames . ''
we went into that church and heard rev . moss preach , and after he did , this choir of gorgeous women , 100 women strong , stood up and began to sing .
i can love .
a few years ago , there was a man walking on the beach in alaska , when he came across a soccer ball that had some japanese letters written on it .
and yet , we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism .
and now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends , of wakefulness and hope and mightiness and interconnectedness , there is a burgeoning , multifaith justice movement in this country that is staking a claim on a countertrend , saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world .
yes , i 'm in rap songs .
so like me , at 22 , a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person , maybe even your boss .
i 'm here because i 've been legally required to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation .
first of all , i would like to say that i 'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on tv , at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
this man , joel salatin , they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .
with all these things i 've been learning about the food system , it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer , or we can pay the hospital .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
he asked him if he wanted organic toasted o 's or the sugarcoated flakes — you know , the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front .
( applause )
`` in 1868 , thomas huxley wrote , `` '' how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when aladdin rubbed his lamp . '' '' now , huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated , but he did n't know why . ''
to the science of his day , it was a mystery .
well , i disagree . i 'm more optimistic .
i think so , but could i be wrong ?
could i be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
`` he wrote : `` '' i think that tastes , odors , colors , and so on reside in consciousness . ''
in this next example , you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots .
all i 'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue .
they say that we reconstruct reality .
the males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate .
evolution had given them a hack .
( laughter ) even when crawling all over the bottle , the male could n't discover his mistake .
fortunately , we do n't have to wave our hands and guess ; evolution is a mathematically precise theory .
the jewel beetle survived for thousands , perhaps millions of years , using simple tricks and hacks .
what the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms , including us , are in the same boat as the jewel beetle .
you do n't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software .
so i 'm saying something far more radical than those physicists .
we all see a train because we each see the train that we construct , and the same is true of all physical objects .
now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
we 're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences .
why ? because we 're blind to our own blindnesses .
actually , this is n't as crazy an idea as it seems , and i 'm currently exploring it .
okay , throw that theory away .
ca : so you think it 's possible — ( laughter ) — this is cool , but what you 're saying i think is it 's possible that evolution can still get you to reason .
what 's true about perception may not be true about math and logic .
ca : don , i could literally talk with you for hours , and i hope to do that .
once there was a star .
like everything else , she was born ; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time .
in the process of becoming a supernova , the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster , like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body .
you 're seeing a plot .
what happens to them if they develop a disability ?
`` while other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field , south africa said , `` '' we want people with disabilities to contribute to the field . '' '' right now , i 'm working at the south african astronomical observatory , at the office of astronomy for development . ''
there , we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the athlone school for the blind .
if people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field , an explosion , a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place , i am sure .
it feels like the united nations here .
it is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba .
so i took it home and i watched .
as it goes , each food node it finds , it forms a network , a connection to , and keeps foraging .
we invited people to become slime mold for half an hour .
you have to communicate through oscillations , no speaking .
but they were n't as efficient as the slime mold , and the slime mold , for me , is a fascinating subject matter .
and the slime mold is also my working material .
it 's about seeing what 's around that next coral head or what 's around that next tree , and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves .
it 's called aquarius .
for us , it 's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone .
what we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef , darting in , grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes , they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs .
it 's available to every one of us .
`` my father , `` '' how can people protect what they do n't understand ? '' '' and i 've thought about this my whole life . ''
nothing is impossible .
[ patients often die within weeks of diagnosis. ] [ 49 countries have reported xdr-tb. ] [ xdr-tb is a critical threat to global health. ] [ extreme outbreak , suffering , affliction ] [ extreme loss , pain , pandemic ] [ extremely preventable. ] [ xdr-tb. ] [ we can stop this now. ] [ spread the story . stop the disease. ] [ go to xdrtb.org now. ] [ xdrtb.org : we are the treatment. ] [ we are the treatment. ] [ made possible through the kind support of bd. ]
the electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago .
a giant battery could .
because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings , here to center stage .
and you know , if we 're going to get this country out of its current energy situation , we ca n't just conserve our way out ; we ca n't just drill our way out ; we ca n't bomb our way out .
this is the starting point for designing a battery — two electrodes , in this case metals of different composition , and an electrolyte , in this case salt dissolved in water .
we need to think about the problem differently .
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that do n't cost us a fortune .
so about six years ago , i started thinking about this problem .
the process was invented in 1886 by a couple of 22-year-olds — hall in the united states and heroult in france .
it 's about 50 feet wide and recedes about half a mile — row after row of cells that , inside , resemble volta 's battery , with three important differences .
volta 's battery works at room temperature .
i 'll show you how .
i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i 'd come upon the answer .
you know , i 've got to tell you , one of the greatest benefits of being a professor : colored chalk .
and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature .
and based on david 's initial promising results , which were paid with seed funds at mit , i was able to attract major research funding from the private sector and the federal government .
so a year and a half ago , david and i , along with another research staff-member , formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress and the race to manufacture product .
and then we 've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon .
avoid thermal runaway .
liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer , but they 'll be larger .
`` it 's my one way of getting rid of my mind , getting rid of this mind that says , `` '' hey , you know what you 're doing . you know exactly what you 're doing . ''
`` you 're a director , you 've done it for years . '' '' so i 've got to get there and be in complete panic . ''
it 's a symbolic gesture . i tear up the script , i go and i panic myself , i get scared .
all preparation is preparation .
i do n't even know if it 's honest .
so the first thing about storytelling that i learned ,
panic is the great access of creativity because that 's the only way to get rid of your mind .
and i do n't know why , but i remember the story .
there was a woodcutter who 's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood , and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .
how did i do it ? tell a story .
now , a film .
`` and i said , `` '' why ? '' '' he said , `` '' because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext . ''
and what they did was , they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self .
remember , in the film , to me , both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body , one the mortal self and one the spirit self .
and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities , about 10 to 12 percent of the people have moved to the upper city .
harmony is the notes that mozart did n't give you , but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that .
it is finite ; harmony is infinite .
i 'm reminded of that every time i walk past highbury fields in north london .
but if you zoom in , in the very center of brasilia , just where the point is there , you see it 's littered with desire paths .
they then paved them .
for example , ayr muir in boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant .
if we look back at the one in north london again , that desire path has n't always been there .
if we just wind the clock back a few years , when the stadium was being constructed , there is no desire path .
someone installed a barrier , people started walking across and round the bottom as you see , and they paved it .
( laughter ) but i think this is a wonderful reminder as well , that , actually , the world is in flux .
get out there and see what people really want .
thank you very much .
however , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
but that was me years ago .
it 's a huge problem .
and ever since then , i 've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff — from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys .
( applause ) naomi shah : hi everyone . i 'm naomi shah , and today i 'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients .
it confused me ; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season ?
which is surprising to me , because these chemical pollutants , through my research , i show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated .
i 'm going to show it to you on my laptop .
`` so any user can come in here and click on `` '' lung function report '' '' and it 'll take them to this report that i created . ''
so what it shows — if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner — it shows julie 's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar .
contagious is a good word .
laughter is contagious . passion is contagious .
so , i 'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at riverside .
a little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer .
it transformed them . what you will see is their journey , and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .
since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood .
it was time now to infect india .
i mean , it was incredible .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
man : this program is wonderful .
we feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write .
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
woman : it was a revelation for me . it does n't strike me that they had so much inside them .
if not now , then when ?
this was formed over four billion years ago in the earliest days of the solar system while the planets were still forming .
teams of scientists across the globe are searching for these objects , discovering new ones every day , steadily mapping near-earth space .
it 's got 920 million miles on the odometer , but it still runs great and reliably takes a photograph of the sky every 11 seconds .
an object 140 meters or bigger could decimate a medium-sized country .
i would drive it and demand things from it .
my father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday , for example .
i was a vegetarian , i was sober , i did n't smoke .
but all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body — a further disassociation , like planting a vegetable field on a freeway .
other women became mad , driven machines like me .
in fact , it became so extreme i wrote a play about it .
it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea .
it was advocating friends and a doting sister .
why is it that as capitalism developed , it created a mode of production , of goods and services , in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated ?
before you answer that , have a look at this map .
that 's probably more than at any time in centuries .
now , many of you will object .
in tedistan , there are no borders , just connected spaces and unconnected spaces .
over 50 new countries were born .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
does that mean that someone 's gain has to be someone else 's loss ?
so history does n't necessarily repeat itself , but it does rhyme .
this is just to give you a taste of what 's happening in this part of the world .
for poorer countries , china reduces tariffs so that laos and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well .
china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
it has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community .
what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese co-prosperity sphere .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
that , i believe , is going to bring peace to this particular conflict .
the last time that was the case was actually a century ago , during the ottoman empire .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters , ruins .
he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule .
the great game connotes dominance of one over the other .
silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
the more pipelines we have , the more silk roads we 'll have , and the less of a dominant great game competition we 'll have in the 21st century .
now let 's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders , and how that has enhanced its strength .
well , south central asia , south west asia is a very good place to start .
eight years after the u.s. invaded afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability .
several weeks ago greenland 's [ 60,000 ] people voted themselves self-governance rights from denmark .
then we 'll wind up with the world we want , a borderless one .
the goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market , and the maize flower is used to make ugali , a polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables .
it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory .
for a small-scale farmer in the middle of africa , the maths of doing those visits simply do n't add up .
this satellite measures whether there were clouds or not , because think about it : if there are clouds , then you might have some rain , but if there are no clouds , then it 's actually impossible for it to rain .
this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that 's important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
it 's a very different value proposition .
we took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed , and in every bag , we packed a card that had a number on it , and when the farmers would open the card , they 'd text in that number , and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel .
no more years of the cup .
thank you .
now , i 'm going to take you to los angeles , and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
now andy lipkis is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island — linking trees , people and technology to create a more livable city .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
now judy bonds is a coal miner 's daughter .
now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years ' worth of coal .
`` that kind of technology is called `` '' mountaintop removal . '' '' it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months . ''
i mean , they are not — they ai n't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that .
they 're not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive — and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
these examples indicate a trend .
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america .
to me , charity often is just about giving , because you 're supposed to , or because it 's what you 've always done , or it 's about giving until it hurts .
and over the past 20 years , we 've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems , yet educational outcomes , malnutrition , incarceration , obesity , diabetes , income disparity , they 've all gone up with some exceptions — in particular , infant mortality among people in poverty — but it 's a great world that we 're bringing them into as well .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
hometown security is next on my to-do list .
one morning , in the year 1957 , the neurosurgeon wilder penfield saw himself like this , a weird freak with huge hands , huge mouth , and a tiny bottom .
so anyway , even if i do not understand science entirely , for my design i essentially refer to it .
or neither with including complex technology .
`` and this noise is like a `` '' shhhhhhhhhhhhh , '' '' like that . ''
and this noise is the most neutral .
it 's too in silence .
i do n't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot .
and the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object , for sure , but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object .
and we build the project to the end .
we do not follow instructions . and so on .
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
and the concept is to create a kind of onion , a kind of structure in layers .
and you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment .
and you follow the treatment like that , to the end of the treatment .
and he does not feel anymore it 's relies on asthma treatment , as the asthma treatment needs him .
so it 's , for me , a great product .
and i tried to design a kind of canary .
andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air , contaminated indoor air .
the locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles .
local river is able to provide you food directly in your living room .
after that you have two options .
or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your tv set .
so now we can breathe safely .
so , in this office , you do not work anymore at your desk , like a politician .
in this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper , but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave , like a prehistoric scientist .
i guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig i was .
the tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally , but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal .
the people on the tracks just continued to watch them .
i turned around to check on my friend 's house .
we think this boat is going to phuket hospital , but if it 's too dangerous to land at its pier , then perhaps it will go to krabi instead , which is more protected .
in general , everything was merely hearsay and rumor , and not a single person i spoke to for over 36 hours knew anything with any certainty .
one from thailand , and the second one from phuket as well .
[ unclear ] ( screaming ) they called me out here .
and what you had was a group of essentially unorganized , unconnected writers , video bloggers , etc. , who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us .
but instead , what we 're finding on the internet — and one of the great geniuses of it — is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all .
`` the yale law professor yochai benkler , in an essay called `` '' coase 's penguin , '' '' talks about this open-source model , which we 're familiar with from linux , as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations . ''
that 's a very powerful idea , and it 's a very powerful reality .
`` you know , as chris mentioned , i wrote a book called `` '' the wisdom of crowds . '' '' and the premise of `` '' the wisdom of crowds '' '' is that , under the right conditions , groups can be remarkably intelligent . ''
and they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them .
and that , i think , is a sort of thing to watch out for .
now , i want to connect this back , though , to the tsunami , because one of the great things about the tsunami — in terms of the blogosphere 's coverage , not in terms of the tsunami itself — is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon .
so , that 's the upside . the circular mill is the downside .
in the west , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted .
but few people discern its twin .
over the last three months , in the united states , in britain and in the eurozone , we have invested , collectively , 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods — things like industrial plants , machinery , office blocks , schools , roads , railways , machinery , and so on and so forth .
and indeed , our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient athens .
whereas athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor , our liberal democracies are founded on the magna carta tradition , which was , after all , a charter for masters .
now , in our democracies today , this separation of the economic from the political sphere , the moment it started happening , it gave rise to an inexorable , epic struggle between the two , with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere , eating into its power .
the problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate , automation makes the twin peaks taller , the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper , including — soon , i believe — in places like china .
so we need to reconfigure , we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres , but we 'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere , lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes the matrix , the movie , look like a documentary .
it 's what , effectively , john maynard keynes proposed in 1944 at the bretton woods conference .
will such a world dawn ?
it was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian marxist .
so if this analysis holds water , then marx is absolutely relevant .
would you like to share that ?
in our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .
to move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive — and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the eurozone , which is threatening , massively , the whole of the european union process .
we had an opportunity on the basis of the greek program — which by the way , was the first program to manifest that denial — to put it right .
bg : what kind of change are you foreseeing ?
if there 's any minister of finance , or of anything else for that matter , who tells you after six months in a job , especially in such a stressful situation , that they have made no mistake , they 're dangerous people .
yv : absolutely .
they also have an estimate of around a billion .
and the problem of poor vision , is actually not just a health problem , it 's also an educational problem , and it 's an economic problem , and it 's a quality of life problem .
i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses . i shall pop this in my pocket .
next step in my process .
okay , so i 've made these glasses and ...
and i 've now made some glasses . that 's it .
there are about 30,000 in use now .
the technology is being further developed — the cost has to be brought down .
how do you solve this problem ?
and the answer to that is research .
if you want to know more , just come have a look at our website . thank you .
( applause )
as a result of these efforts , and the help of many others , it happened .
as these carcasses sink , they provide a feast to some 400-odd species , including the eel-shaped , slime-producing hagfish .
so over the 200 years of whaling , when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans , we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans , and as a result , probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival .
sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land .
the 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent .
we also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages , so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
we can just navigate in this very simple way .
when i was nine years old , i went off to summer camp for the first time .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
and what i 'm saying is that culturally , we need a much better balance .
this is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
and they featured role models like abraham lincoln , who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
guess what ?
( laughter ) and that 's a lot harder for me , because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
number one : stop the madness for constant group work .
be like buddha , have your own revelations .
thank you very much .
behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
while it 's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we 're equally , if not more , accountable .
currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
it 's sort of the good old , traditional form of terrorism , but it 's sort of been packaged for the 21st century .
it 's something we have to , too , and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start , in effect , putting on their google-tinted glasses , or whatever .
and you 're not really going to , in the '80s , end capitalism by supporting one of these groups . it 's a load of nonsense .
the brand has an achilles ' heel .
the other thing to do is to knock the product , attack the brand myth , as we 've said .
it 's not just the marketeers of terrorism , which is those who finance , those who facilitate it , but it 's the consumers of terrorism .
and we have to get our messaging in there .
so we 've got to find a different mechanism , and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is the victims of terrorism .
you can see their scars . you trust them .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she 's on the beach , every so often she 's going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
i want to go back just to before the bang , to this idea of brand , and i was talking about coke and pepsi , etc .
`` the first one has been dubbed `` '' lawfare , '' '' for want of a better word . ''
if anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it , you 're wrong .
it self-educates both sides , enables a better understanding , reveals the strengths and weaknesses , and yes , like some of the speakers before , the shared vulnerability does lead to trust , and it does then become , that process , part of normalization .
now , i just want to end with saying , if we follow reason , we realize that i think we 'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it .
we can think them out . we can create incredible things .
it 's something very personal .
and i think that 's also part of life .
so again , radical versus conservative .
it 's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending .
you know the soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
so i think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space , into city life .
but architecture is not the language of words .
i think that 's part of what the complexity of architecture is .
there is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple .
and as wondrous as it is , it can not be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired .
our intellectual desires are complex .
because architecture is also the asking of questions .
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
what is raw ? the raw , i would say is the naked experience , untouched by luxury , untouched by expensive materials , untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture .
and of course buildings have their shapes .
so that is indeed what is memory .
but i rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness .
so again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
it 's an art of communication .
it can reach into millennia that have been buried , and return them in a just and unexpected equity .
it should not play it safe , because if it plays it safe it 's not moving us in a direction that we want to be .
risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws , into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready-made thing .
these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us , but are important for everybody in this world .
we have to rely on others , and shape the process in the best way possible .
( applause )
and the key detail of this is that fey 's scripts were n't written by her and they were n't written by the snl writers .
and there 's this mental delight that 's followed by the physical response of laughter , which , not coincidentally , releases endorphins in the brain .
( laughter ) three things i 've tried to avoid my entire life . ( laughter )
comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the internet , social media , even cable tv .
( laughter ) but it 's when you put all of these elements together — when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that 's crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
and perry 's policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain .
and earlier this year , he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world .
twenty or 30 years ago , if a bank in north america lent too much money to some people who could n't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust , that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower , but we did n't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade .
this is clearly not a good arrangement .
why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards ?
and this is a question we need to ask ourselves .
the third reason is hardly worth mentioning because it 's so silly , but there 's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be .
why did i do this ? well , because the governments that i advise are very , very keen on knowing how they are regarded .
basically what it told me was — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries .
so my colleague dr. robert govers and i have spent the best part of the last two years , with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people , cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries give to the world .
and i 'm going to tell you , but first of all i want to tell you precisely what i mean when i say a good country .
the only reason why it 's below ireland is because its lowest score is lower than ireland 's lowest score .
i 'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower-lying countries .
prosperous , wealthy , fast-growing countries .
i 've even had enough hearing about happy countries because in the end that 's still selfish .
i 'm not asking a lot .
`` when you elect them , when you reelect them , when you vote for them , when you listen to what they 're offering you , use that word , `` '' good , '' '' and ask yourself , `` is that what a good country would do ? '' ''
and i have to say , the most interesting part in this picture , that people mostly react to , is the walking desk .
tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of linux .
lt : i mean , i still work alone .
i did not start linux as a collaborative project .
`` it was more like , `` '' look , i 've been working on this for half a year , i 'd love to have comments . '' '' and other people approached me . ''
`` this could actually improve this . '' '' lt : it did n't even start by people contributing code , it was more that people started contributing ideas . ''
but i do love other people who comment and get involved in my project .
ca : so all the technologists that i talk to really credit you with massively changing their work .
and it 's not just linux , it 's this thing called git , which is this management system for software development .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
i do n't code for — well , i do code for fun — but i want to code for something meaningful so every single project i 've ever done has been something i needed and — ca : so really , both linux and git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people .
i was clearly more interested in the rubik 's cube than my younger brother .
because i was not — i was a geek .
`` going back to the `` '' i 'm not a people person , '' '' — sometimes i 'm also ... ''
but that 's not everybody .
there are people who care about the ui .
this is not important — although , details are important .
to me , the sign of people i really want to work with is that they have good taste , which is how ...
but there must be something else .
and i am not a visionary .
and i 'm in the edison camp , even if people do n't always like him .
because if you actually compare the two , tesla has kind of this mind grab these days , but who actually changed the world ?
and one of them is , i 'm doing fine .
science was there first .
another is to change our lifestyles .
things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .
this was figured out by robin williams a few years before the rest of us .
even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual potency .
`` and companies like navigenics and dna direct and 23andme , that are giving you your genetic profiles , are giving some people a sense of , `` '' gosh , well , what can i do about it ? '' '' well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes — they 're a predisposition — but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed . ''
i actually want answers from you .
famine .
the stories that we want to know , and the stories that do exist about positive tales .
you should have seen my parents ' reaction !
i went to the siwa oasis . that was one of my stops .
so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers .
it also is the second most populated continent , with 900 million people .
so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data .
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day — the same league as kuwait , the same league as venezuela .
`` we have to move away from what 's called `` '' the curse of the commodities . '' '' because it 's not about oil , it 's not about commodities . ''
let 's look at agriculture . let 's look at forestry .
in tanzania last week , we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard .
but here is the sweetener in the deal .
south africa : in the 20 percents . high ones .
what africa is providing is a diversification play , and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that 's aware of what he or she is doing .
now , when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things , and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things , comparisons become important .
today , 16 african countries and growing have sovereign country ratings . what does this mean ?
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
poor nutrition , access to water , climate change , deforestation , lack of skills , insecurity , not enough food , not enough healthcare , pollution .
why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
we 've been aware of these problems for decades .
these problems still seem very daunting and very intractable , and any solutions we 're achieving are small solutions .
what 's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems ?
and the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
why ? because that profit allows whatever solution we 've created to be infinitely scalable .
they resisted workplace improvement .
shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously .
it 's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
and government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way .
they were blank on one side , and on the other side i listed some simple instructions .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
i love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
`` `` '' your mic was n't off during sound check . ''
and it had n't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
`` so i emailed him back and i said , `` '' please share with me an image , something , that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . '' '' and he emailed me this picture . ''
matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called ifoundyourcamera .
matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
this is the last postcard i have to share with you today .
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret ?
fw : sometimes i share that information , yeah .
and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
now what does this have to do with leadership ?
their decisions , their actions matter .
i 'm talking about the elite .
now , my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was 16 years old .
because of his uniform they speak to him differently , and they explain to him that they 're just following orders .
leadership matters . those men are following the orders of a superior officer .
it matters a great deal .
the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual .
i became a parent .
now , i was a little scared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
i 'm trying to bring the experience that i had at swarthmore to africa .
`` and it said , very simply , `` '' i am thinking now . '' '' and he signs off , `` '' thank you . '' '' it 's such a simple statement . ''
am i out of time ? ok .
now , i just wanted to leave that slide up because it 's important that we think about it .
she won with 75 percent of the vote .
and it gives me a lot of hope .
the persistence , their ability to deal with ambiguity , their ability to tackle problems that they have n't seen before .
we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation .
thank you , and god bless .
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
it was either you 're a meat eater or you 're a vegetarian , and i guess i just was n't quite ready .
sound familiar ?
simple .
if you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
while our selection process is not as rigorous as nasa , it 's nonetheless thorough .
we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .
from the entrance , this is nothing like a commercial cave .
you 're looking at camp two in a place called j2 , not k2 , but j2 .
otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
it 's basically like a tree collecting water coming down .
so i 've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s .
so descend into huautla plateau in mexico .
if there is a monster underground , it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance .
and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater .
( video ) narrator : exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before .
this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper , and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave , and it happened to be underwater in wakulla springs .
`` for those who have never seen this story , jim cameron produced a really wonderful imax movie couple of years ago , called `` '' aliens of the deep . '' '' there was a brief clip — ( video ) narrator : a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge . ''
it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice .
and as the movie says , this is one smart puppy .
one is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
we calculate gradient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there 's a high probability of life .
we move along the wall , in what 's called proximity operations , looking for changes in color .
if it passes the microscopic test , we go for a collection .
orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on .
the final missing piece , the real paradigm-buster , is this : a gas station on orbit .
we have to beat that .
we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .
you can burn rocket fuel to get there , or you can do something really incredible .
this is not like that . i 'm much more like scotty .
but , if you were truly bold you could get it there , manufacture it , and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done .
the orbital refueling stations i 've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration .
i would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at ted .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and frank , you 've come to a place in your life , which is astonishing .
i mean it is astonishing for an artist , for an architect , to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .
it 's a big issue .
i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .
but i could n't do anything else .
that was my response to the people in the time .
i approach each project with a new insecurity , almost like the first project i ever did , and i get the sweats , i go in and start working , i 'm not sure where i 'm going — if i knew where i was going , i would n't do it .
and like the playwright said the other day — i could relate to him : you 're not sure .
fg : i do n't really know .
fg : yeah .
they want to add to it and it 's hard to add to a building like that — it 's a beautiful , minimalist , black steel building — and richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it 's a lot of acreage .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it was n't ...
fg : no , it 's near the current campus .
rsw : i found the most remarkable thing .
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there 'd be extraordinary spaces .
and it 's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
but you 've got to — yeah , well up until then every building leaked , so this ...
and i think that 's what i 've always been interested in , is that — which is a personal kind of expression .
that 's what reminded me of it .
is that a curse , that people want a bilbao building ?
and i 've met with some of these people .
in one case , i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .
i asked them what kind of building it was .
`` i said to my team , `` let 's get out of here . '' ''
we stood up , we walked out .
i do n't think these doctrines are right .
i really like looking at old churches .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john .
and that 's a very plausible idea .
we 're only just holding it together .
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation — and religions know that .
so religions are cultures of repetition .
in the catholic chronology , catholic calendar , at the end of march you will think about st. jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we do n't .
you 've heard that saying .
i could n't disagree more .
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
essentially it 's propaganda .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum — if i was a museum curator , i would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
the catholic church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal .
they 're collaborative , they 're branded , they 're multinational , and they 're highly disciplined .
these are all very good qualities .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff — the therapists , the poets — are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
and that 's what religions do .
i want to conclude .
if you 're involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
so one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
it 's not as though , as i try to suggest , it 's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you do n't have religion and then you 're cut off from all these very good things .
ca : it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
ab : no , we need to be polite about differences .
it 's seen as hypocrisy .
`` but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says , `` '' well you know , i did pray the other day , '' '' you politely ignore it . ''
because you 've agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
( laughter ) ab : well , one thing that we 're all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
we got to the moon for one simple reason : john kennedy committed us to a deadline .
and our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of apollo again .
it is a picture that in my wildest dreams i could never have imagined when i was 18 and figuring out that i was gay and feeling estranged from my country and my dreams because of it .
( laughter ) ( applause ) but i want to talk about the need for us to dream in more than one dimension , because there was something about apollo that i did n't know when i was 8 , and something about organizing that the rainbow colors over .
our access to information is through the roof , our access to joy , grounded .
there was a time when we did n't understand space .
`` ( applause ) maybe it 's `` '' i want to stay sober '' '' or `` '' i want to build a tree house with my kid . '' '' you know , instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet , go up to the person who is all alone and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee . ''
thank you very much .
so , recently , we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe — and by ordinary matter , i mean you , me , the planets , the stars , the galaxies — the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe .
it does n't interact at all . so how do we know it 's there ?
the rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
and there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster .
they 're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster , ok .
and again , what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see .
or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , we see that there 's a lot of gas in this cluster , as well .
in fact , there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter , ok .
and suppose there 's a galaxy out here in the universe .
is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer 's eye from that galaxy ?
yes , great . i see people going down like this .
we shave it off , and i have a little gravitational lens , ok .
they 're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions , or mirages , practically , of the background galaxies .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
so to understand the evidence for dark energy , we need to discuss something that stephen hawking referred to in the previous session .
so they 're moving further apart .
it was the opposite of what was expected .
there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe , and they have very different effects .
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they — their number density , how many there are as a function of time — we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
we have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter .
they can come through the building , through the earth — they 're so non-interacting .
and i 'm sure you have lots of questions , which i very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours , while i 'm here . thank you .
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
you see them all the time , you think .
lots of snow in which to dig a den .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific , depends on the salmon .
and we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks .
now , the series has n't even aired yet , so you 're the very first to see this .
( video ) narrator : the tube-lipped nectar bat .
if human , he 'd have a nine-foot tongue .
it 's freezing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
sometimes it 's hard to breathe , especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment .
`` most people say , `` '' i 'd like to die at home . '' '' eighty percent of americans die in a hospital or a nursing home . ''
do n't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child .
prepare a one-page summary of your medical history , medications and physician information .
put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards , your power of attorney , and your do-not-resuscitate order .
when you believe it 's okay to let go , you will .
what i 've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life , we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life .
but the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking .
( tapping ) so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
how can we tell the difference between the sound of the sun and the sound of a pulsar ?
some of the crackles and pops were lightning , but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin .
so whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution , watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves .
over the next few years , astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky , about jupiter and the sun , by listening .
they were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity .
it was in the microwave range , and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously .
( applause )
so how can we save what we do n't understand ?
two of our instruments are very unique : one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them .
but the real power of the cao is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems .
the hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants .
the first questions is , how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests ?
that 's all ships , airplanes , trains and automobiles combined .
and what 's amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
we can fly to this area in northern peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the amazon river and floodplain cutting right through it .
we can also fly to the southern andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system .
let me tell you , i spend a lot of time in these places , and we 're seeing the climate changing already .
look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners .
species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this , obviously .
we flew over this same river , imaged the system in 3d .
so in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique , important corridors like the western amazon and the andes amazon corridor , we have to start making geographically explicit plans now .
this tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat , and that 's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts .
the example i started out with about lions hunting , that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in south africa .
or , how to deal with a large species like elephants , which may , if their populations get too large , have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species .
as we cross this fence line , now we 're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants : dense vegetation , a radically different ecosystem .
until then , you 're going to find me flying in some remote place that you 've never heard of .
thank you .
what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious . what is that cow eating ?
( applause ) br : and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger , which is a cool side effect .
so the key now is to make it behave like tuna .
let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think . ( laughter ) br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this — this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we 're , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people do n't eat them .
and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients .
( applause ) ( applause ) i am a papercutter .
as a teenager , i was sketching , drawing , and i wanted to be an artist .
they can be with words or without words .
i love oddities of languages .
and everywhere i lived , i learned the languages , but never mastered them .
so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .
and my daily language is english .
and we can use them also as a safety net .
i can not speak for all my images , so i 'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title .
`` and at one point , i had to do `` '' the whole nine yards . '' '' so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long . ''
i started with small images , i started with a few miles .
`` here it 's an artist book installation called `` '' identity project . '' '' it 's not autobiographical identities . ''
they are more our social identities .
you can also install them as public art .
and outside the library , i wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind .
so it 's a tree , and in its trunk you have the roots of languages .
you can also have function and form with public art .
so in aurora , colorado it 's a bench .
because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts , you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .
and it 's what story cutting is all about .
the rabbi says he does n't believe in god .
what 's going on ? how did it come about that we have this list ?
you could n't give an account of the natural world that did n't say something about its relationship , for example , to the creation story in the abrahamic tradition , the creation story in the first book of the torah .
the society that i grew up in , asante , coming into that world at the turn of the 20th century with this question that made the list : what have they got instead of christianity ?
this is a soul disc .
and similarly , there were many other things , many other practices .
for example , every time anybody had a drink , more or less , they poured a little bit on the ground in what 's called the libation , and they gave some to the ancestors .
the bridegroom 's [ grandmother ] , was with us , they did n't mean it figuratively .
here 's my story .
but you know , this is how forest research in canada goes .
so i got out of the truck and i got to work .
the biggest , darkest nodes are the busiest nodes .
it 's not so pristine .
we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests .
i do n't mean no cutting , but less cutting .
the value of nothing : out of nothing comes something .
some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk — van gogh syndrome — that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression .
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , i had expectations placed on me .
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything .
and they 're the same ones that i have today .
so , in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter .
there is also a big question of ambiguity .
maybe things go wrong . and so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
but you apply this .
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .
in writing a story , it is the place where i begin .
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day .
another chance encounter is when i went to a place — i just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine .
and i had a chance to do that , when national geographic asked me if i wanted to write anything about china .
`` and , of course , as westerners , we say , `` '' well , it was an accident . that 's not fair . ''
and they have to be in all possibilities , including those i never considered before .
actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story .
my daughter 's 20. she 's a college student .
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
( laughter ) people explain to me that it 's hard , but that it can be done .
i study this .
when he goes to work , he does n't stop by to talk to anybody , he does n't call .
for kids growing up , that skill is the bedrock of development .
we 're developing robots , they call them sociable robots , that are specifically designed to be companions — to the elderly , to our children , to us .
we turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control .
being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved .
but we 're at risk , because actually it 's the opposite that 's true .
if we 're not able to be alone , we 're going to be more lonely .
`` when i spoke at ted in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , `` '' those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . '' '' and that 's what i 'm calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us . ''
but it 's time to talk .
but it 's not , it 's early days .
i see some first steps .
do the same thing at work .
we have everything we need to start .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
`` and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone , except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior . but the word `` '' behavior '' '' is also , i think , sometimes misunderstood in this context . ''
of nuclear arms control — the nuclear arms race .
that puts a lot of pressure on greenland .
this is the winner .
the developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace . and actually , their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965. and they 're catching up very dramatically . the total concentrations : by 2025 , they will be essentially where we were in 1985 .
we need to do it for our own economy .
the latest figures show that the old model is not working . there are a lot of great investments that you can make . if you are investing in tar sands or shale oil , then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets .
we ca n't wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
now , to close , we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine .
another that ended slavery . and that gave women the right to vote .
we can do this . do n't tell me that we do n't have the capacity to do it .
`` sometimes i hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying , `` '' oh , this is so terrible . ''
al gore : you have no idea . ( laughter ) ca : when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now — i mean , there 's — are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
use the internet . go on the internet .
the temperature 's going to drop two , three degrees centigrade .
but there is a problem .
the second point i want to make about the favelas is , you 've got to open spaces in the favela .
let me get you one of our 8,000 buses .
a live transmission in downtown rio for you , mr. mayor .
maybe you do n't believe it , but here is the fact .
2009 , copenhagen .
if you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience , i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history .
it was frankly a horrible moment for me , and i thought , well , no , hang on , hang on .
and with that understanding , you should have witnessed , in fact , part of you were , the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through , first through nonnational governments , the private sector , captains of industry , insurance companies , investors , city leaders , faith communities , because they all began to understand , this actually can be in their interest .
this can actually improve their bottom line .
well , now we have a shift in the economic equation , and with that , with broader support from everyone , it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest .
and here 's the more important part : what did we have before ?
and it was n't just those who had participated directly .
and how did we do that ? by injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration , that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global needs , and that if we understand that , we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously .
and as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century — food security , water security , home security , forced migration — i see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet .
but we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change and we can understand that we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality .
because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers , and that your loss is my gain .
so at this point , i 'm experiencing , or i 'm witnessing something interesting .
and i 'm totally guilty of this as well .
but if you think about it , what would happen if you put those things down ?
ow !
so , what does that precision buy us ?
some of it , of course , is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them .
but they also compete after mating with their sperm .
now , you know , people write fiction and talk about parallel universes .
i 'm a cancer doctor , and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago , and this was the cover of fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy .
and so , as a cancer doctor , you look at this , and you get a little bit downhearted .
we 've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia , where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission , but in general , we have n't made an impact at all in the war on cancer .
there 's no molecular test , there 's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday , there 's no fancy looking at the chromosomes .
because it 's heterogeneous , and that 's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer .
so , our dictionary for describing cancer is very , very poor .
in the next month , the end of december , you 'll see ovarian cancer , and then lung cancer will come several months after .
there 's also a field of proteomics that i 'll talk about in a few minutes , which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .
if you could start to move that , to identify what you 're up against , you 're going to do things a hell of a lot better .
it 's not in the abstract ; it 's the interaction with the environment .
and that is a very different optimization scheme , a very different strategy for all of us .
`` so what we do in our field is we change and input , we give aggressive chemotherapy , and we say , `` '' did that output get better ? did that pain improve , etc. ? '' '' and so , the problem is that it 's not just one system , it 's multiple systems on multiple scales . ''
each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified .
so , instead of a reductionist view , we 're taking a step back .
that 's about it .
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
yesterday , the national cancer institute announced a new program called the physical sciences and oncology , where physicists , mathematicians , are brought in to think about cancer , people who never approached it before .
a whole new approach , instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms , to try to bring technology to get a picture of what 's actually happening in the body .
we need to start to think differently and radically .
tell them to me or anyone else in our field , because over the last 59 years , nothing has changed .
thank you very much .
not only the jews , he 'd taken the temple vessels .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quarters of the world going to do ?
and they 'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way , in their own place .
this is the decree , this object is the evidence for the fact that the jews , after the exile in babylon , the years they 'd spent sitting by the waters of babylon , weeping when they remembered jerusalem , those jews were allowed to go home .
this is the jewish version of the same story .
and by the time of his son darius , the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control .
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit , and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .
no other evidence .
and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution , by geology , here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true .
the state of israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over .
cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the shah .
10 years later , another story : iranian revolution , 1979 .
then another iran-iraq war .
and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past , their great past when they fought iraq and won .
so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together , as we 've been doing , the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan .
and last year , the cyrus cylinder went to tehran for the second time .
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta .
in new york this autumn , it will be present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place .
your animals are your family 's sole source of income — as long as they 're healthy .
living in tight quarters , one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing , until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm .
two weeks later , you 'd hear back the results .
pigs have dna .
even bacteria and some viruses have dna too .
but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short — a few dozen to several thousand letters long .
well , several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer , like you .
when he sources new truffles to grow on his farms , he 's exposed to the threat of knockoffs — truffles that look and feel like the real thing , but they 're of lower quality .
i know families who are already living in this reality .
and it 's at times like this that profound transformation is bound to happen ; moments when a transformative , powerful technology that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower , finally becomes within the reach of every one of us , from farmers to schoolchildren .
it is in our dna to be curious .
i did n't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue .
sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research .
how then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ?
i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done .
this is especially important in developing countries , where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
if you come from a developing country like myself , i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country .
( laughter ) that 's it . ( laughter )
and it comes down to a couple of things .
dr. peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do , which is different than the way reptiles grow .
and in fact , he used the cassowary as an example .
so this was a problem , and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called hypacrosaurus .
and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like , if it grew in sort of a linear fashion , it would have a crest about half the size of the adult .
so this was interesting .
they do n't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
and then stygimoloch , another dinosaur from the same age , lived at the same time , has spikes sticking out the back of its head .
guess where that came from ?
the dome , that little dome , is growing really fast .
because everybody wants to have a big one .
and that 's pretty cool .
so torosaurus is extinct .
it 's a giant duck-bill dinosaur .
so we look at the bone histology .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-graders .
let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works .
is fission kind of played out , or is there something left to innovate here ?
it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon , but they love this stuff .
their burn-up is much higher .
and the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is , you 've got these rods that are clad in zirconium , and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets .
they love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place .
but let 's go back to safety , because everybody after fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear , and one of the things when i set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe , and i 'm really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons .
one , it does n't operate at high pressure .
because your fuel is liquid , and it 's combined with your coolant , you could actually just drain the core into what 's called a sub-critical setting , basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers .
so thank you guys .
they had small families and long life .
and partly to usa who help to provide technical advice and investment .
and you see all the world moves over to a two child family , and a life with 60 to 70 years .
but some countries remain back in this area here .
but if i would change this axis here , i would instead put income per person .
and the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years , on par with afghanistan today .
did you note there , that we have mexico up there ?
so they come in with the two perspectives i have , you know ?
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
we have the high income countries here , with the united states as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here .
i heard that your departments here were by regions .
and on this , heath , child survival , and it does n't come as a surprise that africa south of sahara is at the bottom .
it is mayflower down here . it is washington here , building , building countries .
it 's lincoln here , advancing them .
( laughter ) and it is my task , on behalf of the rest of the world , to convey a thanks to the u.s. taxpayers , for demographic health survey .
it is due to usa 's continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what 's happening in the world .
and the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .
they started very well . they used the aid well .
they vaccinated the kids . they get better water .
this means that the world is converging .
and it 's not the economy . richer country has a little higher .
do n't make it africa . do n't make it a race issue .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we do n't know .
this is the disease , konzo , i spent 20 years elucidating in africa .
that has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
and one week ago , for the first time , there were four lines on the internet .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
and we forget this now , but back then the mujahideen were celebrated in this country , in america .
but within that group , a tiny , smaller group , a minority within a minority within a minority , were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad , and in time this group would come to be led by osama bin laden , and he refined the idea .
he worried that if he called her by that name , especially outdoors , outside in public , he might be seen as endorsing bin laden 's idea of jihad .
he was wrong . some people were paying attention , but for the wrong reasons .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
`` they had never paid him any attention before — old man , small mosque — but now they began to pay visits , and sometimes they would drag him in for questions , and always the same question : `` '' why did you name your granddaughter jihad ? ''
so there is now an al qaeda in the islamic maghreb , there 's an al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , there is an al qaeda in mesopotamia .
usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism , or it 's a power struggle .
you may remember these guys .
the good news is that it does n't have to be .
in reality , it was the beginning of the end for him .
who killed bin ladenism ? al jazeera did , al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
al jazeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions .
we do n't need to persuade them , but we do need to help them , because they have n't really come to this place before .
we 've got plenty of these things .
some of the other things that they need we 're not very good at giving . maybe nobody is .
his definition of jihad can now be expunged .
you were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt .
and maybe a blue pair of shoes — click !
`` but you hit `` '' submit order . '' '' and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep . ''
not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders , it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders .
turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly .
of course webvan went out of business , and about a year and a half later , i was still noodling on this problem . it was still nagging at me .
this is what i need . what technology is available to solve this problem ?
but as you can see , orders can come and go , products can come and go .
so how did i arrive at this notion ?
if i need it , i 'll call you , otherwise just stand there .
we 'll call them red pens , green pens , yellow post-it notes .
and they feel a little bit more in control of their environment .
and we 're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse .
one other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous .
( laughter ) so whether you 're doing two pick stations , 20 pick stations , or 200 pick stations , the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work .
and all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes .
welcome to 10,000 feet .
our core project is a rather ambitious folly — i suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period .
it 's about nine feet high .
that 's what happens to buildings . they 're vulnerable .
how about underground with a view ?
and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain , so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest .
it 's nowhere near any interstate or railroad .
and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here , who started the process , long now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land .
and in fact , pretty soon we 'll hear the sound .
it might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain .
something that 's just yours .
the stone itself is absolutely beautiful , sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there .
and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine . it 's a mile deep .
they do n't quite meet .
and so one tuesday morning last june , there we were .
kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station .
let 's go to approaches .
well , here 's a potential approach .
in fact , there he is . that 's alexander rose .
( laughter ) so we finally decided on alexander 's siq .
we should probably put in a rail or something .
one is the experience of the mountain .
in fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air .
and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going .
and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley , because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on , and there 's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition , and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park , and it would double the size of great basin national park . that would be swell .
you excavated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it .
thank you .
we are anonymous . we are legion .
`` put on a black armband , or crack open the champagne ? '' '' ( laughter ) and of course , who could escape the irony of a member of rupert murdoch 's news corp . ''
being a victim of hacking for a change .
but there is also a very serious aspect to anonymous — they are ideologically driven .
there 's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them .
and i sort of get it .
instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
but interestingly , anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
but what about the real cybercriminals ?
now i spoke to one of these carders who we 'll call redbrigade — although that was n't even his proper nickname — but i promised i would n't reveal who he was .
and this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise .
as an eight year-old , he and his parents fled the sri lankan capital because singhalese mobs were roaming the city , looking for tamils like renu to murder .
and when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications , he was already in too deep .
at his open prison , he came under the influence of financial fraudsters , and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release .
he set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup , bankfrauds @ yahoo.co.uk before arriving in britain in 2005 to take a masters in chemical engineering at manchester university .
and then finally , cagatay evyapan , aka cha0 — one of the most remarkable hackers ever , from ankara in turkey .
one of the smartest people i 've ever met .
they are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens . they are all people
they are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities — are mobilizing them on behalf of the state .
thank you very much for listening .
`` we want to work with you . '' '' chris anderson : okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot misha . ''
( laughter ) that 's right .
i 'm going to optimize everything .
we 're going to save money , we 're going to avoid delays and disruptions , and bottom line , we 're going to save lives .
this is not quite how it panned out .
you have 30 possible foods , and you have to pick five of them .
and that 's already over 900 million options .
companies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world .
some companies are already doing it .
but even if the floodgates opened up , and even if all companies donated their data to academics , to ngos , to humanitarian organizations , it would n't be enough to harness that full impact of data for humanitarian goals .
to unlock insights in data , you need decision scientists .
in addition to donating their data , they need to donate their decision scientists .
and that 's a big deal for a profession that 's in high demand .
today i 'd like to show you the future of the way we make things .
but on the other side , if you look at the natural systems , we have proteins that have two million types , can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds , or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour .
so there 's something super interesting about natural systems .
and i think the key to that is self-assembly .
then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up , or reconfigure .
and i think it really brings to light : is this really scalable ?
one of them is the input from the user , as you 're building your bricks .
it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
and from that you have new possibilities for computing .
imagine if our buildings , our bridges , machines , all of our bricks could actually compute .
i was covering the war in afghanistan , and i witnessed , as a reporter for al jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that .
however , the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world .
this is why they did not accept .
a new generation , well-educated , connected , inspired by universal values and a global understanding , has created a new reality for us .
we have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams : these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world , who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
parents actually went to the streets and they supported them .
we are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .
yes , some of these young people are connected to the internet , but the connectivity in the arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from .
but this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from .
al-qaeda is taking over our territories .
because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone — ordinary person who i do n't know — from tahrir square .
is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?
you are witnessing the birth of a new era .
unfortunately in the united states , we are not covering but washington d.c. at this moment in time for al jazeera english .
i believe they 've heard your talk .
thank you so much .
you sit there , ok .
so nice air comes flowing in .
i have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and i was n't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong .
if you do n't get an opening shock , you do n't get a parachute — you 've got a whole new problem set .
and that 's not going to hurt .
i 'd been successful , but things changed so much that i was going to have to make some significant changes , and on that morning , i did n't know it .
and i still believe real leaders are like that .
we move forward , and we get wiped out — i mean , wiped out immediately .
`` they put a big screen up , and they take you through everything : `` and then you did n't do this , and you did n't do this , etc . '' ''
a 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
i went down to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan , and on that operation , a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team .
so how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they have n't done what the people you 're leading are doing ?
and yet , again , you 're not all in one room .
then another thing .
this is n't easy stuff .
so i 'd like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan .
as computers became increasingly more complex , our students were losing the forest for the trees , and indeed , it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box p.c . or a mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed , proprietary software .
the trick was to decompose the computer 's construction into numerous stand-alone modules , each of which could be individually specified , built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project .
so chip specifications , apis , project descriptions , software tools , hardware simulators , cpu emulators , stacks of hundreds of slides , lectures — we laid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over , take whatever they need , and do whatever they want with it .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
for example , take dan rounds , who is a music and math major from east lansing , michigan .
a few weeks ago , dan posted a victorious post on our website , and i 'd like to read it to you .
so instead , you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error , and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one . you can cut the figure , you can rearrange the parts , you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before .
so after some guided trial and error , the child will discover , with or without help , that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result , transpose it , glue it to the original and then proceed [ with ] what we did before : cut , rearrange , paste — oops— paste and glue , and tile .
led by peasant-born pol pot , the khmer rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia , much like mao tse-tung 's cultural revolution in china .
but not just that , they actually banned money .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it did n't actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
and she spoke some vietnamese , as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends .
and they 're giving about — in a modern-day , caloric-restriction diet , i guess — they 're giving porridge , with a few grains of rice .
but she 'd given the boys girls ' names , and the girls boys ' names .
and she actually , of course — i 'm here , she passes .
but for us it meant freedom .
what 's the problem ?
you see , we 're going to launch more than 100 of these satellites like these over the course of the next year .
this is the very first picture taken by our satellite .
thank you .
what exploration would you do ?
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
rg : so today , what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos .
rg : i 'm sorry .
and instead , when the baby was placed in my hands , it was an extraordinary moment .
i mean , i had to check the tags and make sure .
`` i was incredulous , `` '' are you sure this is our child ? '' '' and this was all quite remarkable . ''
and so we 've done something here that is heretical .
you 're not allowed to chart love .
the reason you 're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing .
i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity .
so alisa 's experience is not isolated .
as i was working through that mourning process , i was amazed that i did n't want to see anybody .
there 's another factor in our case .
and so the final question that we would ask is : can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards ?
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .
for a moment , i felt terrified , humiliated , and sorry for myself .
the perception of women 's life in gaza is passive .
by the time i managed to open my eyes , i had documented this moment .
i became a witness with a choice : to run away or stand still .
thank you .
well , anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust .
ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the united states .
now , what 's even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids ' abilities .
thank you , bill gates , and thank you , ma .
why ?
and there 's no progress , we get stuck .
`` and so she went to one of the girls , and said , `` you have to give me your facebook password . '' ''
so the teacher ca n't log into facebook until she gets home .
i know that things are actually worse than these guys think .
so i log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing .
well , what we tend to do about it is we think about orwell space .
it 'll only show you the party invitation if i actually have one .
is that just a pipe dream ?
of course not , otherwise i would n't be here talking to you .
there are 6.6 billion mobile phone subscriptions .
which proves that psychic paper has an mse interface .
yeah . three is a magic number .
all : a-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four .
cc : triplet-triplet . triplet-triplet .
i skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back . 800 miles in 10 weeks .
i 'd spoken to all the experts .
ultimately , we ran out of time .
no one has made a complete crossing of the arctic ocean on their own .
we had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming , photography ; while the helicopter was still there , i did an interview on the satellite phone ; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter , wham , the door closed , and i was alone .
i was , you can see there , pulling two sledges .
polar bears on the artic ocean move in dead straight lines .
the wireless telescope was a digital camera i had tucked in my pocket .
there is n't even a pole at the pole . there 's nothing there , purely because it 's sea ice . it 's drifting .
( video ) : oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
there 's a cafe and there 's a tourist shop .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they 're the things that excite me .
and it 's also about potential , on a personal level .
and on a wider scale , it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential , just doing three or four or five percent of what they 're truly capable of . so , on a wider scale , i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet .
the next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ?
they got to the pole late january 1912 to find a norwegian flag already there .
`` they had been literally crying and praying and thinking , `` '' will we let our 12-year-old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail ? '' '' and they decided to do it . ''
`` and as a result of that experience , in the middle of the week , while i was there in jail , dr. king came and said with our parents , `` '' what you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born . '' '' i recently realized that two-thirds of americans today had not been born at the time of 1963 . ''
a lot of our students get into theater .
and the number one reason , we find , quite frankly , is they did not do well in first year science courses .
and what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it .
`` i. i. rabi , a nobel laureate , said that when he was growing up in new york , all of his friends ' parents would ask them `` '' what did you learn in school ? '' '' at the end of a day . ''
he retook the course .
but she had a factor that was very important .
she and her adviser have a patent on a second use of viagra for diabetes patients .
big hand for her . big hand for her .
so building community among those students , very important .
whether you 're talking about artists producing artists or you 're talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline — and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example — you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
`` i 'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying , `` '' i 've got this young man in class , a young black guy , and he seems like he 's just not excited about the work . ''
and what i 'm saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students , telling young women , young minority students and students in general , you can do this work .
`` it represents the wisest option among many alternatives . '' '' and then he said something that gives me goosebumps . ''
`` he said , `` '' choice , not chance , determines your destiny . '' '' choice , not chance , determines your destiny , dreams and values . ''
thank you all very much .
it 's a talking horse .
in fact , i have just an average memory .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
he 's up in legacy good samaritan hospital in portland , oregon .
ed : all right.tb : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
most of the time it does n't create any kind of mischief , but it does warrant looking at , so i 'm happy we 've got an opportunity to look at it today , make sure that it 's not growing , it 's not creating any problems .
out of all the care i 've had in hospitals and clinics around the world , the first time i 've ever had a true team-based care experience was at legacy good sam these last six months for me to go get this .
we 're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers , as well as have an exchange network online , where , for example , i can donate three hours of care a day to your mom , if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals , and we exchange all of that online .
the most important point i want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized doctor-patient one-on-one is a relic of the past .
i was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
and i tell you , this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game-changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime .
( applause ) so tracey , just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you .
i also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .
the one after that , i stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar for 36 hours .
there is a chemical that 's called perflubron .
and then i learned how to purge .
i started learning about the world-record holder .
so , everything that i put into my body , i considered as medicine .
and what he did in response , is he went on regis and kelly , and broke his old record .
but in practice , i would do it face down , floating on the pool .
and i started having ischemia to the heart .
so i started a farm in missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
we 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways .
i 've planted a hundred trees in a day .
a greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .
this gives us genetic diversity , or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity .
that 's probably true of humans as well , mostly .
first of all , pollen is tiny . yes we know that .
that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized , this pollen .
you can tell that from the little barbs on there .
a different pollen signature , if you like , or a different pollen fingerprint .
four very different habitats might look similar , but they 've got very different pollen signatures .
`` or if you 're familiar with `` '' the princess bride , '' '' it could create a six-fingered man . ''
so my friends , molecular programmers , and i have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach .
and if i have n't revealed my prejudices already , i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
so one big question is , how does a baby know when to stop growing ?
what 's the smallest number we can get away with ?
so , i 'm going to start asking those questions for the dna structures i 'm going to talk about next .
they can take a couple of years , or it can be difficult to design .
this is part of that genome .
now , we ca n't actually take a movie of this process , but shawn douglas at harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .
it feels the dna origami .
you can zoom in and even see the extra little loop , this little nano-goatee .
and what 's really neat about it — well , actually , this all looks like nano-artwork , but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits .
so , you can put circuit components on the staples , like a light bulb and a light switch .
so , now you can say , all right , why is n't dna origami the end of the story ?
the fact is that it does not scale .
so if you want to build a human from dna origami , the problem is , you need a long strand that 's 10 trillion trillion bases long .
so , that answers that sort of first question i was talking about .
and the neat thing about it is , is that it 's also reprogrammable .
and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strands we use , if we use counting , if we use a little bit of computation .
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it , the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory .
so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles — rather than to the staple strands , you affix them to the tiles — then they 'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits , the demultiplexer circuits , that you need to address this memory .
what it 's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
it 's my dad .
`` we get things like , `` '' i want to die . ''
we 're talking '95 now .
we chose rats .
you see an operator , a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
`` is `` '' tering , '' '' which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar . ''
this is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
microscopy for 1,800 patients .
throughout last year , we 've been — depending on which intervals you take — we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
and there are simple things like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
if you have money , of course , you can get the value .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lower-middle-class .
he said , oh , probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney .
i still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated .
until midnight , he 'd be thinking .
and the nano team average age was just 27 years .
broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
all ideas on board were welcome .
imagine that a fellow who sells cloth , for example , will be selling nano .
but the current entry-level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less , but 21 percent more inside space .
when the model t was launched — and this is , by the way , all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices — model t was 19,700 by ford .
this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home .
and that 's why i call it a transformational innovation .
you can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land , sometimes in a marshy land , and so on and so forth .
and if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe , you 're talking about 10,000 days of income .
and i like to show how it looks and how it works .
( applause ) an incredible story .
what 's happening in the area of health ?
and if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now , what has happened ?
so actually we are getting less from more for less and less people .
psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
cost of development — 300 million dollars .
he is giving us not just for psoriasis , for cancer and a whole range of things , changing the whole paradigm .
and therefore , ladies and gentlemen , this is the theme , getting more from less for more .
so you are not talking about low cost , you are talking about ultra-low cost .
and therefore , you 're not talking about incremental innovation , you 're talking about disruptive innovation .
i 've still one and a half to go .
and there was a bright spot up there .
it has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
`` it 's named after latin for `` '' seahorse , '' '' which it resembles . ''
so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .
`` so together they form a map for the rest of the brain , telling the brain continually , `` where am i now within my environment ? '' ''
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
and when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you — extended buildings and so on — is particularly important for the hippocampus .
he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there .
but he knows where it was , so he knows to go and get it .
so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains .
( applause )
my mother was born in sacramento , california .
they met and married in los angeles , and i was born there .
due process , this is a core pillar of our justice system .
i remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us .
i was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
`` my baby sister said , `` '' mama , let 's go back home , '' '' because behind barbed wires was for us home . ''
they were at the middle of their lives and starting all over .
and he took me to a campaign headquarters — the governor of illinois was running for the presidency — and introduced me to american electoral politics .
we were denied service , and categorized as enemy non-alien .
they were put into a segregated all japanese-american unit and sent to the battlefields of europe , and they threw themselves into it .
they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally .
the germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible .
they all fell silently .
they are my heroes and my father is my hero , who understood democracy and guided me through it .
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
but as a result , they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them .
well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
it is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love , or rather in the name of seduction capital .
in light of this observation on contemporary love , how can we think of love in the years to come ?
but we can , for instance , imagine a dating website which , a bit like those loyalty points programs , uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age , my height/weight ratio , my degree , my salary , or the number of clicks on my profile .
we can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment .
it 's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies .
and i feel very strongly that it 's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid — and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people were n't having the courage to try .
and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
we 've lost that capability . we abandoned it in '72 .
this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in 1961 .
these things tend to happen every 25 years .
there 's a group of people that have come forward — and you do n't know all of them — but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
you remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
and would you have thought , would the russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside wo n't be russians ? maybe it 'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire ? well , that 's weird : you know , it really is .
the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde .
i predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u.s. taxpayer spends for nasa 's manned spacecraft work .
do n't be fooled . there 's nothing new about id .
now , the next one .
among biological scientists , the figure is even lower : 5.5 percent , only , believe in god .
we tended to die at home , in our own beds , looked after by family , although that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care .
now , i 'm an architect , and for the past year and a half i 've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying .
during that period , we 'll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes .
you know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs .
this is l'ospedale degli innocenti , built in 1419 by brunelleschi , who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time .
one of the things that surprised me most in my research , though , is how changeable attitudes actually are .
another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them .
we had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways , and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death , and that maybe that 's not how you 're supposed to act .
you had to go to the library , see if you could get them to find the books for you , you know , footnotes and all that .
it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record , except there 's a couple of problems .
everything is interconnected .
as a shinnecock indian , i was raised to know this .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
`` and that got me into a discussion with some other people , other scientists , about maybe some other subjects , and one of the guys i talked to , who was a neuroscientist , said , `` you know , i think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up , '' and reminds me of michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you ca n't have a solution if you do n't have a problem . ''
but terrorists are n't the only threat we face .
i would propose , therefore , that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget — which is two one hundredths of that budget — and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i 'm going to talk to you about , the vast majority could be solved , and the rest we could deal with . so , i hope you find this both fascinating — i 'm fascinated by this kind of stuff , i got ta admit — to me these are richard 's cockroaches .
people around the world are getting better medicine — but mentally , we 're falling apart .
we do n't really have mental health insurance in this country , and it 's — ( applause ) — it 's really a crime .
something like 98 percent of all people with depression , and i mean really severe depression — i have a friend with stunningly severe depression — this is a curable disease , with present medicine and present technology .
but it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills .
pills alone do n't do it , especially in clinically depressed people .
although every time i go to pompeii , i 'm amazed that they had the equivalent of a mcdonald 's on every street corner , too .
( applause ) it 'll also help us a lot , if we meet an advanced civilization along the way , if we 're trying to be an advanced civilization . number eight — ( voice : steve , that 's what i 'm doing after ted . ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) sp : you 've got it ! you 've got the job .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
you all remember ted kaczynski , the unabomber ?
a lot of very sober-minded physicists , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .
they are expecting to create little , tiny black holes .
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth .
you may of heard of it — heard it called starlink , especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago .
one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is , is that we have — you know , we do n't have good weather data from 60 years ago , much less data on things like the ozone layer .
so far , our atmosphere has done , and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this .
number two — my favorite — we meet a rogue black hole .
`` you know , 10 years ago , or 15 years ago , really , you walk into an astronomy convention , and you say , `` you know , there 's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy , '' and they 're going to hoot you off the stage . ''
but it only has to get close , about a billion miles away , one of these things .
and this is my scariest . ( laughter ) i do n't have a good answer for this one .
in 1908 , just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles .
there are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock — comets , really — out there , that are 50 miles in diameter or more , and they regularly take a little spin , in towards the sun and pass reasonably close to us .
could we have the solutions ?
and they 're trying to do that .
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing .
this is just a matter of finding 'em , going there , and doing something about it .
i know your head is spinning from all this stuff .
as you wave your hand across the map , the name of the piece of real estate — the building or the cemetery — is revealed .
but the uk , like many western european countries , is running out of burial space , especially in the major cities .
so they came up with a few solutions .
so they 'll look at what it looks like .
well , then — actually , i do n't need permission from anyone !
so actually , if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery , then you can .
but i mean , like — really , who does this ? right ?
( laughter ) so what if you wanted to try this yourself at home ?
so we 're not thinking about this , but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it — they 're not taking care of it either .
but that 's the irony .
weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn , as was customary at the time , but his executioner was new to the job , and he 'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare .
give them water , and they will resurrect , green up , start growing , in 12 to 48 hours .
well , the current world population is around 7 billion .
we 're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food .
and loss of a small amount of water results in death .
most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss .
wheat , rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies .
like seeds , these are desiccation-tolerant .
take away the water , those membranes fall apart .
then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we 've actually discovered in our other studies .
more appropriately , some of my collaborators at uct , jennifer thomson , suhail rafudeen , have spearheaded that approach and i 'm going to show you some data soon .
the nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing .
now to the final approach .
they only switch them on in seed tissues .
it would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes .
each eye is controlling a different device .
i sat down next to a stout , middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie , and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar , there in china specifically to study sino-soviet relations .
the surgeon emerged from the surgery .
he built a playhouse for our daughter .
two years go by .
we take the kids to australia .
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
it 's newer . it 's more powerful .
we never got the chance to say goodbye .
we always had hope .
`` being a journalist , after terence died , i wrote a book , `` '' the cost of hope . '' '' i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did , why he did what he did , why everyone around us did what they did . ''
yet we never got to no further hope .
yet i will tell you that denial is n't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through .
the family wo n't listen to reason .
they 're in denial .
`` it 's so clear , yet they 're in denial . '' '' now , i think this maybe is n't a very useful way of thinking . ''
you want to help . you want to fix .
giving up the fight — for that 's how it felt , it felt like giving up — meant giving up not only his life but also our story , our story of us as fighters , the story of us as invincible , and for the doctors , the story of themselves as healers .
maybe we do n't need a new piece of paper .
hospice was for people who were dying , and terence was n't dying .
he 's won all the fights , he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost .
the people are leaving . they 're playing instruments .
blood diamonds , smuggled emeralds , timber , that is cut right from under the poorest .
and that is that if we want to have one world , this one world can not be based on huge pockets of exclusion , and then inclusion for some .
we propose 10 .
i wo n't elaborate .
and there are lots of other examples .
money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
it 's just cash .
do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited ?
thank you .
no . but seriously , the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as , at least , a 10- to 20-year perspective .
time has been compressed .
in our world .
and what is their predominant concern ?
they see engagement , global engagement , as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people .
if you talk to someone today in america about sexual activity , you 'll find pretty soon you 're not just talking about sexual activity .
let 's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity : the trigger for sexual activity , what happens during sexual activity , and the expected outcome of sexual activity .
somebody 's trying to defend people moving into the field .
that 's often given to the girl .
`` `` well , maybe we can go half and half . '' ''
okay , but what about pizza ?
there are a million different kinds of pizza .
and none of them are wrong . they 're different .
but what about pizza ?
if we 're still hungry , we might have some more .
and who gets to answer those questions ?
thank you very much for your time .
it was november 1 , 2002 , my first day as a principal , but hardly my first day in the school district of philadelphia .
fast forwarding a decade later to 2012 , i was entering my third low-performing school as principal .
you see , ashley was right , and not just about her school .
i am a leader , so i know i can not do anything alone .
we took the chains off the front doors of the school .
all during the school day .
but because of my amazing mother , i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me .
( laughter ) they ask , and i answer each question honestly , and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions .
thank you .
they 're now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they 've reached the letter p .
`` they also legislate on correct usage , such as the proper term for what the french call `` '' email , '' '' which ought to be `` '' courriel . '' '' the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be referred to as `` '' la toile d'araignee mondiale '' '' — the global spider web — recommendations that the french gaily ignore . ''
it 's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted .
there are dozens or scores of verbs of this type , each of which shapes its sentence .
`` you can say , `` '' give a muffin to a mouse , '' '' the prepositional dative . ''
first , there 's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure , which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence , that governs our use of language .
does n't care about perceptual qualities , such as color , texture , weight and speed , which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions .
`` or , `` '' rose forced herself to go , '' '' as if there were two entities inside rose 's head , engaged in a tug of a war . ''
well , i said i 'd talk about two windows on human nature — the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world , and now i 'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction , again , as reflected in language .
even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied , they can be stretched and extended .
for example , communality applies most naturally within family or friends , but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it .
now , mismatches — when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one — can be awkward .
you want to express the bribe , the command , the promise , the solicitation and so on , but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person .
and you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix .
there 's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer .
`` if you do n't bribe the officer , then you will get a traffic ticket — or , as is the case of `` '' fargo , '' '' worse — whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest . ''
so you get the best of both worlds .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .
there are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the united states and that 's because in the past 40 years , our incarceration rate has grown by 700 percent .
i have one slide for this talk .
i got interested in this other path to adulthood when i was myself a college student attending the university of pennsylvania in the early 2000s .
this senior thesis became a dissertation at princeton and now a book .
in the first 18 months that i lived in this neighborhood , i wrote down every time i saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors .
chuck was 18 when we met , a senior in high school .
the other kid was fine the next day , i think it was his pride that was injured more than anything .
but anyway , since chuck was 18 , this agg . assault case sent him to adult county jail on state road in northeast philadelphia , where he sat , unable to pay the bail — he could n't afford it — while the trial dates dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year .
okay , you might say .
and certainly not for the same things that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
crime is down . that 's a good thing .
injustice is about being wrongfully convicted .
right now , we 're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods , who have the least amount of family resources , who are attending the country 's worst schools , who are facing the toughest time in the labor market , who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem , we 're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line — to basically never do anything wrong .
why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges ?
we 're seeing states throw out stop and frisk as the civil rights violation that it is .
richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
`` and another man looked in my direction and said , `` yes , there he is . he 's on this elevator with us . '' ''
`` and finally , john belk said , `` do you know who 's sitting here ? '' ''
in one generation , the nation of the people of israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the near east .
but david changed all of that , and he introduced the iron age to israel .
and revolutions ?
i would like to see oracle take up that , or some other technological geniuses work on this .
the problem is not technology .
the problem is the person or persons using it .
i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something .
they do n't know what it is . i speak at many universities , and i have many questions and answer periods , and whether it 's cambridge , or harvard , or oxford — i 've spoken at all of those universities .
what 's life all about ? why am i here ?
`` writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , `` man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . '' ''
i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years .
i have n't given a talk in nearly four months .
i talk ad lib .
why do we suffer ? it 's an age-old question that we have n't answered .
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
and they 're — they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person .
but death is inevitable .
and we were meeting in that room , the statue room .
`` and i said , `` '' there 's one thing that we have in common in this room , all of us together , whether republican or democrat , or whoever . '' '' i said , `` '' we 're all going to die . ''
i 've stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
`` it passes so fast . '' '' but it does not need to have to be that way . ''
he was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39 .
but in the developing world , things are quite different .
now the big , important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system .
and the final point i want to make is that i think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation , validation , commercialization and dissemination , and that cycle has to start and end with end users .
since we took to the sky , we have wanted to fly faster and farther .
and we 've had to refuse to fear failure .
at mach 20 , we can fly from new york to long beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds .
at that speed , the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel — 3,500 degrees fahrenheit — like a blast furnace .
but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards earth .
you see , hummingbirds are not hypersonic , but they are maneuverable .
this is a hummingbird drone .
many prototypes crashed — many .
a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe .
the result , a four-by-four-inch artificial nano-gecko adhesive .
each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees fahrenheit — hotter than the surface of the sun .
and his thoughts made him reach for katie .
and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years .
that moment mattered to tim and katie , and this green goo may someday matter to you .
last september , the gamers of foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys .
and others , also connected to the internet , used it as an instrument of democracy .
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa ?
they are nerds , and they are heroes among us .
you see , there was a time when you were n't afraid of failure , when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing , you were good at math , you could build things , you were an astronaut , an adventurer , jacques cousteau , you could jump higher , run faster , kick harder than anyone .
he was with our transportation team .
and more so than most , he saw the highs and the lows , the celebrations and the disappointments .
he was encouraging , but firm .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause )
no , there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed .
how it 's ultimately used will be determined by the military .
rd : no , not necessarily just a camera .
but there 's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you 'd recognize .
it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we did n't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time .
and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention , but at a personal level , in a way i ca n't imagine doing your job .
my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have .
and with that exhilaration , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
ca : regina , that was jaw-dropping , as they say .
a toroid , for those who do n't know , is the surface of a doughnut or , for some of us , a bagel .
and i felt very troubled .
and then you descend to light and to the north and to life .
`` well , they said , `` '' people wo n't understand , they 'll think it 's a discotheque . you ca n't do that . '' '' and they shelved the project . and it sat there for 10 years , and then one day abe spiegel from los angeles , who had lost his three-year-old son at auschwitz , came , saw the model , wrote the check and it got built 10 years later . ''
but two weeks later , i was in this little town , anandpur sahib , outside chandigarh , the capital of the punjab , and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the sikhs , guru gobind , died in as he wrote the khalsa , which is their holy scripture .
and then i went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking .
and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point .
and here you see the model : a reception building and some underground parking .
you cross a bridge , you enter this triangular room , 60 feet high , which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north .
and at night , just one line of light cuts through the mountain , which is a skylight on top of that triangle .
i 'd like to conclude with a project i 've been working on for two months .
that too was a competition , and it is something i 'm just beginning to work on .
and then as you enter it again , looking in all directions towards the city .
i started with that sentence about 12 years ago , and i started in the context of developing countries , but you 're sitting here from every corner of the world .
this is the first experiment that we did — eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student , a six year-old girl , and he was teaching her how to browse .
( video ) arthur c. clarke : and they can definitely help people , because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
`` sm : and i asked him , `` '' do you send emails ? '' '' and he said , `` '' yes , and they hop across the ocean . '' '' this is in cambodia , rural cambodia — a fairly silly arithmetic game , which no child would play inside the classroom or at home . ''
`` so newcastle gave me a call . i said , `` '' i 'll do it from delhi . '' '' they said , `` '' there 's no way you 're going to handle a million pounds-worth of university money sitting in delhi . '' '' so in 2006 , i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to newcastle . ''
`` i said , `` '' well , did you look at any of the stuff ? '' '' they said , `` '' yes , we did . '' '' `` did you understand anything ? '' `` no , nothing . '' ''
`` so i said , `` '' well , how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing ? '' '' they said , `` '' we look at it every day . '' '' so i said , `` '' for two months , you were looking at stuff you did n't understand ? '' '' so a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says , literally , `` '' apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease , we 've understood nothing else . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( laughter ) it took me three years to publish that . ''
`` i edited out the last bit when i asked , `` '' where is the neuron ? '' '' and she says , `` '' the neuron ? the neuron , '' '' and then she looked and did this . ''
`` `` '' you can exchange groups . ''
the worst , in 45 .
here in britain , i put out a call for british grandmothers , after my kuppam experiment .
200 of them volunteered immediately .
children : i 'm the gingerbread man .
( laughter ) ( applause ) it 's pretty simple stuff .
`` the children looked at it and said , `` '' what ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , do it . '' '' they typed it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google . ''
this one , they took only 10 minutes .
`` it 's pitagora . '' '' and then , in 20 minutes , the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens . ''
self-organizing systems also always show emergence , which is that the system starts to do things , which it was never designed for .
thanks .
a lot of people wo n't take them , or stop taking them , because of their unpleasant side effects .
otherwise , we 're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
and my eponymous colleague , seymour benzer , believed it as well .
so how do we ask this question ?
well , one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion-like states such as arousal , and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties .
you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion .
so we built a device , which we call a puff-o-mat , in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away .
there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation .
so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder .
as seymour showed back in the 1970s , flies , like songbirds , as you just heard , are capable of learning .
the kids ca n't sit still long enough to focus , so they do n't learn .
we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore , or cure , the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain .
what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup .
( laughter ) and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there .
on the other hand , it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time in hong kong . ( laughter )
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
and , you know , there 's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be , you know , situated somewhere here — right in there between delight and bliss .
( laughter ) so , according to this , the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy . ( laughter )
while , somewhat , the spaniards ...
now , what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .
and , you know , my studio — we 've done it all the time .
a happy dog — and you take it out , it 's an aggressive dog .
true printed his own version of these signs .
met every wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends .
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version .
now , the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs .
you 're just in there , watching the incredible , subtle changes of color in the sky .
`` i would definitely say that observing vik muniz ' `` '' cloud '' '' a couple of years ago in manhattan for sure made me happy , as well . ''
and he goes around new york and just puts them , empty as they are , on posters .
try not to get stuck doing the same thing — or try not get stuck behind the computer all day .
this is , you know , related to it : getting out of the studio .
this is from the front .
this is a very complex challenge , and i believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition .
we are nearly five million people , and we live right in the middle of the americas , so it 's very easy to remember where we live .
so i 'm going to take you back to 1948 .
and the president at the time , josé figueres , found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base .
also , if you take a country like ours , the gdp per capita is around 11,000 dollars , depending on how you measure it .
but according to the social progress index , we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning gdp into social progress .
and i believe what comes next is for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good , just as we did with the army .
we know that , and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change .
remember , this is the country where electricity comes from water in our rivers , heat from volcanoes , wind turbines , solar panels , biowaste .
it 's offensive to have to waste our time like this every single day .
we 're talking about electric mobility that is happening today .
we want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes .
the news went viral around the world .
people feel powerless , and they are tired of not being heard .
but first , let 's just take three numbers .
the third number is 12 : that 's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born .
you can see my grandmother there .
so take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products .
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent .
and the best thing is , they 'll also last for more than 20 years .
you 'll change your car , if you have one , three or four times .
we will go all in .
it uses lots of pesticides , lots of fertilizer , lots of water .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
you 've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale , or you can have fantastic , responsible forestry that we can be proud of .
that 's about the size of germany .
use your supply chain to drive good .
by 2020 , we 'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business .
every time the sun comes out after that , the electricity is free .
and it was clearly totally unacceptable , so then you have to act .
increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these , but actually in a survey , many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children .
we also have a foundation that 's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015 .
you know the phrase , you can manage what you measure ?
thank you .
so i have branded myself as a war child .
there is no newspaper to cover her pain , and what she wants to change in this society .
i saw my village burned down .
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it vanish in my face .
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .
and that made me call myself a war child .
sometimes you got ta lose to win .
but still as i wonder , i wo n't go under .
guns barking like lightning and thunder .
i carry the banner of the trauma .
ah ! the children of darfur .
i was ready to eat .
it 's been where i actually see heaven , where i can be happy , where i can be a child again , in dances , through music .
and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love does n't see a color .
and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is .
so what 's happening here ?
today is day number 233 in which i only eat dinner .
`` and so i made a commitment . i say , `` i 'm gon na not eat my breakfast . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' no stop until we get it . '' '' and like it 's been done on facebook , myspace . ''
i do n't know how they did it .
and so , the importance of education to me is what i 'm willing to die for .
( applause ) so in order to do that , i founded a charter called gua africa , where we put kids in school .
and now we have a couple in university .
but i 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here .
i 'm gon na sing this song , just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference .
she came to my country and saw the importance of education .
audience : yes !
♫ i got ta say it again ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ i 'd be a corpse on the african plain ♫ is there anybody who 's here in the back , some love .
this is the same story across the continent of africa today .
when i grew up , i grew up in a catholic home .
and so now , bill and i have three .
it took so long back then because the contraceptives were n't that good .
there 's no reason to believe that african women have innately different desires .
empowering parents — it does n't need justification .
when families in sub-saharan africa are given the opportunity to make those decisions for themselves , i think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development in communities across the continent .
hundreds of cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response , but when they got there , they found a bigger disaster : whole communities with no healthcare , doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff , and just too many babies dying before their first birthday .
over the next few years , governments throughout the americas requested scholarships for their own students , and the congressional black caucus asked for and received hundreds of scholarships for young people from the usa .
today , among the 23,000 are graduates from 83 countries in the americas , africa and asia , and enrollment has grown to 123 nations .
more than half the students are young women .
only 17 made that trip .
embracing diversity became a way of life .
we are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs , and the problem is everywhere .
by 2020 , we will be short 45,000 primary care physicians .
a commission from the lancet rates cuba among the best performing middle-income countries in health .
save the children ranks cuba the best country in latin america to become a mother .
cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the united states , with fewer disparities , while spending per person one 20th of what we do on health here in the usa .
the subjects are familiar — basic and clinical sciences — but there are major differences .
the pain .
hundreds of haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces , overcome their own heartbreak , and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for haiti .
take a look : 748 haitian graduates by 2012 , when cholera struck , nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed , and 110 had left haiti altogether .
in the worst cases , there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector , where most poor people are treated , not enough political will , not enough resources , not enough anything — just too many patients with no care .
the grads face pressure from their families too , desperate to make ends meet , so when there are no public sector jobs , these new mds decamp into private practice , or go abroad to send money home .
what 's new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves : an elam graduate is more likely to be a she than a he ; in the amazon , peru or guatemala , an indigenous doctor ; in the usa , a doctor of color who speaks fluent spanish .
she is well trained , can be counted on , and shares the face and culture of her patients , and she deserves our support surely , because whether by subway , mule , or canoe , she is teaching us to walk the walk .
and you can be secure even if you do n't feel it .
there 's the availability heuristic , which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind .
because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks .
`` i mean , the joke `` '' one , two , three , many '' '' is kind of right . ''
so one half , one quarter , one fifth — we 're good at that .
and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality .
there 's no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but does n't make us feel secure .
enough real world examples helps .
it does n't change ; it 's real .
the two i 'm following are surveillance cameras , id cards , quite a lot of our computer security models come from there .
health models are a great example .
think of cancer , of bird flu , swine flu , sars .
i mean , there were people who were afraid to push doorbells , because there was electricity in there , and that was dangerous .
it has n't changed as we were growing up .
and we 're good at it .
but 80 years , we 're just not good at .
also , personal experiences with crime can do it , personal health scare , a health scare in the news .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
i did n't check the airplane .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i 'll give you one , a syringe .
it turns out when a baby 's born now , they put an rfid bracelet on the baby , put a corresponding one on the mother , so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward , an alarm goes off .
`` i said , `` '' well , that 's kind of neat . ''
but if you think about it , if you are a hospital , and you need to take a baby away from its mother , out of the room to run some tests , you better have some good security theater , or she 's going to rip your arm off .
i must speak to you a little bit of my history , because we 'll be speaking on this during my speech here .
there i learned different things .
i [ went to ] university to become an economist .
and the most important thing in my life also happened in this time .
when i made love with my wife , i had no sperm that came out of me ; i had blood .
i went to see a friend 's doctor in paris , told him that i was completely sick .
it was the moment that my parents became very old .
to build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
here in los angeles , in the bay area in san francisco , it became tax deductible in the united states .
i wished to photograph the other animals , to photograph the landscapes , to photograph us , but us from the beginning , the time we lived in equilibrium with nature .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce co2 , are the trees .
a lack of oxygen in the water .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
you remember that i told you , when i received the farm from my parents that was my paradise , that was the farm .
in each point of those spots , we had planted a tree .
( applause ) i told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem .
and i 'll show you the last picture .
we are doing the sequestration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees .
and i believe that we can do it together .
before the light bulb was invented , people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it , focus it a little bit ; put lenses in front of it , focus it a little bit better .
a little bit of differential , but not much .
that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car — small version , over your head — so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car .
i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard .
now , you 're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you .
they tried this back in the '60s and were too smart , and so they gave up .
you have to be kind of smart , and though i did not graduate from college does n't mean i 'm stupid , because you can not be stupid and do very much in the world today .
hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite : it 's 100 percent based on non-linearity .
i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker , the other ear hears the other . that 's true binaural sound .
( laughter ) or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse . ( laughter )
we make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels .
we put it on a turret with a camera , so that when they shoot at you , you 're over there , and it 's there .
i 've got a coke can opening that 's right in your head ; that 's really cool .
this is the field of biologic replacements , where we replace worn-out parts with new , natural ones .
`` first thing for my wife , and the most common thing i hear from my patients , particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group , 70-year-old age group , is they come in and say , `` '' hey , doc , is n't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee ? ''
well the reason is because there 's not enough donor cycles .
it 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it ( laughter ) , and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee .
so that 's our biologic approach right now .
we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
there 's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation .
it 's not software .
it 's version 2.0 of you .
my older sister was busy torturing my parents , and they were busy torturing her .
i was lucky enough to be completely ignored , which is a fabulous thing , actually , i want to tell you .
but i kept writing bad poetry , and he did n't blow up the math building , but he went to cuba .
so i decided that i would start to draw . how hard could that be ?
so , whenever he sees a suitcase in the house , because everybody 's always , you know , leaving , they 're always cranking this wonderful dog 's tail , and he runs to the other room .
but i am able to make the transition from working for children and — from working for adults to children , and back and forth , because , you know , i can say that i 'm immature , and in a way , that 's true .
but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray gell-mann 's talk .
and hopefully , you 're not talking down to kids and you 're not talking in such a way that you , you know , could n't stand reading it after one time .
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love .
hopefully , a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels , and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve .
but anyway , so we were in venice , and this is our room . and i had this dream that i was wearing this fantastic green gown , and i was looking out the window , and it was really a beautiful thing .
well , he has some hair but — well , he used to have hair .
i work for the new yorker , and i do covers , and 9/11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .
( laughter ) so i decided it needed a few — it needed a lift , it needed a few illustrations .
and basically , i called the , you know , i convinced the white estate , and what an intersection of like , you know , polish jew , you know , main wasp family . here i am , saying , i 'd like to do something to this book .
so , this is , i do n't know if you can read this .
`` and , `` '' he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug . '' '' ( laughter ) so , there 's a kind of british understatement , murder-mystery theme that i really love very much . ''
so , what i did when i was painting was i started singing , because i really adore singing , and i think that music is the highest form of all art .
i played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the new york public library , where you 're supposed to be very , very quiet , and it was a phenomenally wonderful event , which we hopefully will do some more .
who knows ? the new york timesselect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
`` so , once a month for the last year , i 've been doing a column called `` '' the principles of uncertainty , '' '' which , you know , i do n't know who heisenberg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it 's the principles of uncertainty , so , you know . ''
`` `` '' as the last dodo was dying , spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything , called eudaemonia . ''
and there he is , with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic , decrepit palace .
which i think i made up , which is a good thing .
`` and i say , `` '' i hope he 's not really dead , just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow , but the caption says he is dead . '' '' and actually , he was . i think he 's dead , though i do n't know , maybe he 's not dead . ''
`` it is february and not lying is impossible . '' '' and i really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ? ''
how do we know when we are ourselves ?
i taped my aunt . i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the — you know , could we have it for a second ?
`` and then i said — oh , and she was talking about moss hart , and i said , `` when you met him , you knew it was him . '' ''
i think the barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate .
and i look at a beautiful bowl of fruit , and i look at a dress that i sewed for friends of mine .
`` and it says , `` '' ich habe genug , '' '' which is a bach cantata , which i once thought meant `` '' i 've had it , i ca n't take it anymore , give me a break , '' '' but i was wrong . ''
i happen to be alive , end of discussion . thank you .
and what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil , you see some ice cubes , and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm .
the napalm is burning there quite nicely .
it 'll just bake your retinas .
oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
`` nobody gets up in the morning and thinks , `` '' wow ! i 'm going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work . '' '' no , they think , `` '' ugh . i have to go buy gas . ''
`` i am helpless over this . '' '' and this is what happens to us at the gas pump — and actually , gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger . ''
now there 's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas , which is that we 'd rather be doing anything else .
we do n't want to be buying oil ; we want to be doing something green .
i mean , this is a very pervasive — this is part of our dna .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
here we are normally ; we 're standing at the gas pump , and we 're feeling kind of helpless .
in fact , it 's continued to increase .
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
what are the laws ? what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ?
and one of the things that we need to do is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient , but we also need to fix the economy in general .
whether that 's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road , this is where we need to be .
the first thing that you have on the tax is — you have a tax for a stronger america — 33 cents .
and also , the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system .
you may have heard of some of them .
we have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world .
so christmas lights , and you 're saying , what the hell is this guy going to talk about ?
`` at christmas , everything is possible . '' '' so how do we know these trees worked ? ''
`` she was very familiar with the territory , so one night , when she was on guard , she just left , and she went to the army , she demobilized , and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to , and we were really touched by this story , so we made a radio spot , and it turns out , by chance , that far away , many , many kilometers north , he heard her on the radio , and when he heard her on the radio , he said , `` '' what am i doing here ? ''
`` she had the balls to get out . i need to do the same thing . '' '' and he did . ''
captain valdez was the first high-ranking official to give us the helicopters and the support we needed to put these christmas trees up , and he said in that meeting something that i will never forget .
`` he said , `` '' i want to do this because being generous makes me stronger , makes my men feel stronger . '' '' and i get very emotional when i remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him , but i wanted you all to see him , because he was really , really important . ''
`` what happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the christmas tree operation and all of that said , `` '' that 's really good , christmas trees are really cool , but you know what ? we really do n't walk anymore . ''
`` we asked them , `` '' can you send guerrillas a message ? '' '' we collected over 6,000 messages . ''
so since we started this work a little over eight years ago , 17,000 guerrillas have demobilized .
i do n't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do , but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization , and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision .
( applause )
now , when you talk about dangerous animals , most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks .
now let 's assume you go on holiday .
and that 's the nickname given to this disease .
but it 's not one virus , it 's four , and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three .
it 's just not practical .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
this is really unpleasant stuff , and if it was any good , we would n't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we would n't have this massive increase in dengue fever .
fine . we do n't want a lasting environmental impact .
but you do n't want to get all of the insects .
and most of the time , you 'll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this — whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
and then we 've gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits .
and we 've got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
so you take a google map , you divide it up , work out how far they can fly , and make sure you 're releasing such that you get coverage of the area , and then you go back , and within a very short space of time , you 're bringing that population right the way down .
nobody is allowed to film in these meetings .
nothing can stop us from doing what we want .
if we hear you are with [ the opposition ] we will not forgive you .
the youth can beat you .
mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election , and saved hundreds of lives .
mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras .
i did n't like what i saw .
it was a bit like being in a hotel , but with very shitty food .
he will be arrested in a second .
this project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories , and we managed to reduce the number of violent attacks in the west bank .
where i used to work before , in the west bank , one can take a camera out , most likely not going to get shot , but in places we wanted to work , just try to pull a phone out , and you 're dead — literally dead .
the third thing i learned is the importance of verification .
we use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material .
now , the fourth and the most important thing i learned is how you use images to create a positive change .
sometimes , it 's about putting it in the media , mostly local ones , to create awareness .
in the next clip , fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work .
now , keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano , until the middle of the 19th century , when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue — that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
you probably saw it on the news .
one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one .
he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
`` al gore : there is an old african proverb that says , `` '' if you want to go quickly , go alone . ''
`` if you want to go far , go together . '' '' we need to go far , quickly . ''
thank you very much .
but it 's always there .
it 's even inside us .
actually , why do n't we all right now together take one big , collective , deep breath in .
`` it 's called `` '' different kinds of air : a plant 's diary , '' '' where i was recreating the air from different eras in earth 's evolution , and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me . ''
to breathe , this air is really clean and really fresh .
it has that kind of spritz , quite pleasant .
and this future air has some very sensual qualities .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs .
but perhaps it 's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air .
it reflects our decisions as individuals , as governments and as industries .
and if we humans are such a vital part of that change , i think it 's important that we can feel the discussion .
because even though it 's invisible , humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air .
( applause )
`` like philip roth , who said , `` '' and yet , what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people ? ''
`` or to say , as alan greenspan did , `` '' i know you think you understand what you thought i said , but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant . '' '' ( laughter ) so , the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas , one in each hand . ''
and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults .
i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long , extended process .
and while ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass .
let 's see what he does . here comes ivan .
so the three-year-old does two things differently .
so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory , and they take a break for coffee .
now she thinks the powder is sugar .
and perhaps unsurprisingly , if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend 's coffee , people say she deserves no blame at all .
people , though , disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case .
so that 's good , but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people 's moral judgment .
when you hear clicks , we 're turning the machine on .
and the first thing is , people can still do this task overall .
`` but i want to give the last word back to the novelists , and to philip roth , who ended by saying , `` '' the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway . ''
so , there 's a couple of things to say about tms .
and what we changed was not people 's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do , when they 're making action choices .
we changed their ability to judge other people 's actions .
and the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things — learn language and abstract concepts , and thinking about other people 's thoughts — that 's brand new .
it started early .
i grew up in the west of ireland , wedged between four brothers , two older than me and two younger than me .
what i did n't have to think about , either as president or as a constitutional lawyer , was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change .
i met constance okollet , who had formed a women 's group in eastern uganda , and she told me that when she was growing up , she had a very normal life in her village and they did n't go hungry , they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come , they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest , and so they had enough food .
but , in recent years , at the time of this conversation , they had nothing but long periods of drought , and then flash flooding , and then more drought .
i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly .
for developing countries and emerging economies , the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions , because they must develop ; they have very poor populations .
let me come back to president tong and his people in kiribati .
but would n't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory , and be part of the community of nations ?
i was very conscious of this as i took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in 1945 .
and indeed a few years later , the universal declaration of human rights .
`` i was marching with some of the elders family , and i saw a placard a little bit away from me , but we were wedged so closely together — because after all , there were 400,000 people out in the streets of new york — so i could n't quite get to that placard , i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it , because it said , `` '' angry grannies ! '' '' ( laughter ) that 's what i felt . ''
`` we really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference , and that put the world on the right pathway , and we benefit now from that pathway , '' '' that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities , we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms , we did n't miss the opportunity , we lived up to our responsibilities . ''
`` and that wo n't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say : `` '' we want action now , we want to change course , we want a safe world , a safe world for future generations , a safe world for our children and our grandchildren , and we 're all in this together . '' '' thank you . ''
do you mind looking , with me , at that little cross in the center there ?
i am saying something . and your eyes and your brain are saying something back .
since two years now , with some stipends from the science ministry in berlin , i 've been working on these films where we produce the film together .
how do we reconfigure it ?
`` `` '' and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility ? '' '' is art about that ? ''
i would say yes . it is obviously about not just about decorating the world , and making it look even better , or even worse , if you ask me .
and it 's on the other side also , i think , quite beautiful , as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas , in these different places of the world .
negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
and if i vote it makes a difference .
one is an experiment i did for bmw , an attempt to make a car .
if you stand still , the landscape does n't necessarily tell you how big it is .
so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
it 's very much about this causality , consequences .
and i find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your truth .
it is the sound after the noose is already tied .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
when i think about the world i would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren i hope to have , it is a world that moves away from unequal , unstable , unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities — locally , nationally and globally — that share the characteristics of all successful communities : a broadly shared , accessible set of opportunities , a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging .
when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of years ago , i think even though they did n't claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on 9/11 , i think the thing that troubled the british most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
it is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century .
and even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .
none in china . there are now 250,000 registered with the government , probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons .
and all of a sudden , they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money .
so we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain , and went to a low-margin , high-volume , absolutely certain-payment business .
but the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
and pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars .
children 's medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it .
we started a childhood obesity initiative with the heart association in america .
we just reorganized the markets .
and this whole discussion as if it 's some sort of economic burden , is a mystery to me .
i think it 's a bird 's nest on the ground .
the systems are not there to reach the people .
and the test is : one , will it do the job ?
because the longer i deal with these problems , the more convinced i am that we have to — whether it 's economics , health , education , whatever — we have to build systems .
the person , in my view , who has done the best job of this in the health care area , of building a system in a very poor area , is dr. paul farmer , who , many of you know , has worked for now 20 years with his group , partners in health , primarily in haiti where he started , but they 've also worked in russia , in peru and other places around the world .
as poor as haiti is , in the area where farmer 's clinic is active — and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve — since 1988 , they have not lost one person to tuberculosis , not one .
and we 're working in an area called southern kayonza , which is one of the poorest areas in rwanda , with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people .
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
we now are treating 325 people a month , despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the aids patients are now treated at home .
there 's a couple of guys from southern farming families — the first thing i did when i went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they 'd done with it .
we have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation , reorganize itself , focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive , quality health care with minimal outside help .
i made my mind up there and then that one day , somehow , i was going to sail around the world .
so i did what i could in my life to get closer to that dream .
i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal .
and these boats were exciting to sail .
no helicopter can reach you out there , and no plane can land .
the speed i so desperately needed brought with it danger .
it 's not too stressful . we can concentrate .
the mainsail weighed three times my body weight , and after each change , i would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing southern ocean air burning the back of my throat .
`` if i said to you all now , `` '' go off into vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months , '' '' that 's quite a task . ''
it was like it was yesterday .
and the more i learned , the more i started to change my own life .
it 's an economy that fundamentally ca n't run in the long term , and if we know that we have finite materials , why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up , that would create waste ?
for the first time on this new journey , i could see exactly where we were headed .
this was something to work towards .
all of this sounds amazing , but these are n't just ideas , they 're real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
but what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people .
is it actually possible ?
now , that 's a lot , a lot of bees , and that 's really important .
and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december .
in some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called israeli acute paralysis virus .
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it , and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease , because , of course , there 's the implication .
we think perhaps it 's a combination of factors .
if you do n't just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
so even though we 've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
if this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying nra member who 's , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer .
and these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
and he has a history of these trucks , and he 's moved these bees up and down the coast .
and then 20 miles down the road is groveland , and that 's where all the wisconsin beekeepers go .
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it 's a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that 's quite essential american experience .
when they 're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
and of course , they 're made to carry this pollen .
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they 're not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
dennis vanengelsdorp : bee . okay , thanks .
and in fact , if you guys live on the west coast , go to these websites here , and they 're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees , because we think some have gone extinct . or some , the population has declined .
and so that 's incredible . and there 's no money to do that .
but i 'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is ndd : nature deficit disorder .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they 're totally sterile .
i want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
we ca n't live with it ; we ca n't live without it .
this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
and this , this is where it gets interesting , because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty .
and this engine is not just economic value ; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system , driven by our own insatiable appetites , driven in fact by a sense of anxiety .
they want to spend less and save more .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
`` keynes called this the `` '' paradox of thrift '' '' — saving slows down recovery . ''
and politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt , to draw down our own savings even further , just so that we can get the show back on the road , so we can keep this growth-based economy going .
it 's an anomaly , it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people .
so who are we ?
novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself .
it is n't , in fact , about curtailing possibilities .
what would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche ?
what can we offer those people ?
it 's not about overthrowing capitalism . it 's not about
and at the heart of that economics , we 're placing a more credible , more robust , and more realistic vision of what it means to be human .
thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : while they 're taking the podium away , just a quick question .
every time i read chekhov and his unique vision of human life , i 'm reminded of why i too became a writer .
here are three questions drawn from my work .
rather than try to figure them out , i 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them .
for example , the calculation : can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
i 'm an extreme example of this .
words too , for me , have colors and emotions and textures .
and you can see here how my perception of the sound l helps the alliteration to jump right out .
what about 75 ?
64 becomes 6,400 .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
because think of the picture — not the word , the picture .
all the conversation stopped . all the eyes turned to me .
and so , what i 'd like to do now is to tell you about what we 've learned in those journeys .
so , look what they did .
and , third , they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting .
and wal-mart has committed they 're going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year . but it 's not easy .
consumers do n't really like these light bulbs .
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters . it really matters .
and bob epstein raised a hand . he stood up .
well , bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento , california that we need a market-based system of mandates that 's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california .
( applause ) please . thank you .
that 's 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they did n't ship to the middle east .
so , i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology .
so , a team of berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering , designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient , called artemisinin , and they 're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .
for reference , fact one : exxon 's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day .
so , in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises .
who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in south america ?
not enough to stabilize the climate .
`` then he asked , `` '' why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid ? '' '' does anybody here have an answer for him ? i do n't . ''
well , i 'll tell you what . green technologies — going green — is bigger than the internet .
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century .
it could be bigger than wal-mart .
( applause )
`` use science to , you know , work backwards and say , `` '' well , really , what were they thinking ? '' '' and recently , i was in easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you 're struck by these statues , called the moai . ''
and then i met yoyo , who is the native rapa nui-an guide , and if you look at yoyo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
one interesting problem is the stone is n't very hard .
but after 1,000 years out in the weather , they look like this .
another thing i do is i invent stuff .
in fact , i design nuclear reactors .
not a joke .
this is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle .
a metamaterial is an artificial material , which manipulates , in this case , electromagnetic radiation , in a way that you could n't otherwise .
so , this device here is an invisibility cloak .
i 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue .
so , another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , or seti .
so , the jodie foster character here is actually this woman , jill tarter , and jill has dedicated her life to this .
so , you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands , areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring .
this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground .
not the same one , actually . this is a cast , which i had bought , and then , after buying the cast , i found my own , and i do n't have room for two .
the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there 's a problem with asteroid impact , for example .
study of the ancient climate is very important .
and the last day , the sun comes out , the orcas come , they 're right by the boat . it 's fantastic .
and i get lots of pictures like this .
now , to a human audience , i need to explain that if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition , this would be the centerfold .
most african stories these days , they talk about famine , hiv and aids , poverty or war .
namibia has got 2.1 million people , but it is only twice the size of california .
they love namibia for its beautiful dunes , that are even taller than the empire state building .
boy , if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat — cheetah is very nervous — just walk up to it .
`` walk up to it and smack it on the backside . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' and he will let go of the goat and run off . '' '' but then he said , `` '' boy , if you run into a lion , do n't move . ''
the whites could farm , graze and hunt as they wished , but we black , we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife .
they can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened .
and then , in the same year , we almost lost everything .
business communities helped bring namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture .
when i finished school in 1995 , there were only 20 lions in the entire northwest — in our area .
i 'm talking about teachers .
the u.s. is n't number one .
let 's look at the best academic performer : the province of shanghai , china .
it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession .
i am a high school english teacher at johnston high school in johnston , iowa .
okay , so i would like you to please bring up your papers .
you ca n't really dispute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this .
it does n't catch every little thing that 's going on .
[ every classroom could look like that ] ( applause ) bill gates : one day , we 'd like every classroom in america to look something like that .
our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars .
we would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it .
this would n't just make us a more successful country .
it would also make us a more fair and just one , too .
thank you .
i said the electronics are open-source , because at the heart of this printer there is something i 'm really attached to : these arduino boards , the motherboard that sort of powers this printer , is a project i 've been working on for the past seven years .
i worked with these friends of mine that i have here .
you have to have something that actually interacts with people .
`` and i like this phrase : `` '' scratch your own itch . '' '' if you have an idea , you just go and you make it . ''
so you have situations like this , where some people in chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them , to organize a workshop and to save money . or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market , and there 's probably , maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment .
there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community , and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language , beautifully typeset .
or , other projects . matt richardson : i 'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on tv over and over and over again , so i decided to do something about it .
or this machine here , it 's from the diy bio movement , and it 's one of the steps that you need in order to process dna , and again , it 's completely open-source from the ground up .
`` and so when we had to make our own educational robot , we just went to them and said , you know , `` '' you design it , because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids . '' '' not me . i 'm an old guy . ''
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) and thanks to the community .
`` so i just took a short clip from `` '' batman begins '' '' here just to show christian bale 's pulse . ''
we basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time , and then we crank up those changes .
we make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos , or magnified videos , that actually show us those changes .
it 's a video i recorded about three years ago .
and it turns out , there 's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope .
we can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies .
and that 's actually my eye , and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born , so you can see i was n't getting too much sleep . ( laughter ) even when a person is sitting still , there 's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns , small facial expressions .
and you know it 's not real science unless you use guinea pigs , and apparently this guinea pig is called tiffany , and this youtube user claims it is the first rodent on earth that was motion-magnified .
those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them , which is how we hear and how we record sound .
that signal is there in that video .
so here , we 're going to play a note that 's in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that 's next to it .
that 's one thousandth of a millimeter .
testing , testing , one two three .
it lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we 've never been able to see with our own eyes until now .
thank you .
so a couple .
if i duck down , he 'll follow me .
and finally , because romo is an extension of me , i can express myself through his emotions .
you do not have to teach someone how to drive romo .
here you go .
so he actually streams two-way audio and video between any two smart devices .
( applause ) so those are a couple of the really cool things that romo can do today .
the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal .
so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination .
so we ca n't wait to get you all robots , and we ca n't wait to see what you build .
thank you .
yup , yup , i think i probably am .
mckim found this every time he did it with his students .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
and in studies of kids playing , it’s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure , who are in a kind of trusted environment — they’re the ones that feel most free to play .
and if you’re starting a design firm , let’s say , then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
don’t know what they do with that , but they have one .
and i’m going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
i’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage .
all right . this is pretty good ; this is pretty good .
( laughter ) all right . i think i’m going to take these off now , because i can’t see a damn thing when i’ve — all right , ok .
( laughter ) all right , good .
we use it in a pretty pragmatic way , to be honest .
life’s complicated ; we want to figure out what’s going on around us very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
most of us don’t need to anymore , i suppose .
( laughter ) kids are more engaged with open possibilities .
`` now , they’ll certainly — when they come across something new , they’ll certainly ask , `` '' what is it ? '' '' of course they will . but they’ll also ask , `` '' what can i do with it ? '' '' and you know , the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example . ''
we’ve all told stories about how , on christmas morning , our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them .
keep your hands up if you did 10 .
and one of the things we tend to do as adults , again , is we edit things .
mckim published a paper in 1966 , describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity .
and so , some of the things that they figured out , some of these individuals figured out ; in one case , a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients ; a design of a solar space probe experiment ; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator ; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder — you can tell this is a while ago ; the completion of a line of furniture ; and even a new conceptual model of the photon .
in fact , maybe this experiment was the reason that silicon valley got off to its great start with innovation .
but it’s hard to break our habits , our adult habits .
and they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind .
they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war , i think , and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .
and of course , they used experimentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics .
at ideo there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
but the important idea is that everything’s at hand , everything’s around .
but by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands , quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .
but what about designing something that isn’t physical ?
something like a service or an experience ?
something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
and this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care .
but you know , many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play .
let me start by saying , let 's look back to the 20th century , and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us .
at verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
more recently , in the last decade , we begin to see these communities start , hesitatingly , to come together .
it 's a $ 10-billion-a-year discontinuity in the global transport system .
last year , at this time , there were 20 vessels , 500 mariners held hostage .
this is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-trillion-a-year discontinuity in the global economy .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
but my thesis is , open-source security is about international , interagency , private-public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the internet .
this is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
this one , the comfort , operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america conducting patient treatments .
they 're all part of this .
`` when he was fitted , over his extremely myopic eyes , he suddenly looked up and said , `` mama , veo el mundo . '' ''
another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief .
purple are tweets . green are geolocation .
this is a man-made forest .
most of the world we live in today was forest .
this is something which i learned when i made a forest in the backyard of my own house .
every time we work at a new place , we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us .
it could be a flowering forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or it could simply be a native , wild evergreen forest .
we plant the saplings close to each other .
in the first three months , roots reach a depth of one meter .
microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots .
at this stage , every single drop of water that falls into the forest does n't evaporate back into the atmosphere .
this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture .
this decayed biomass forms humus , which is food for the forest .
it was a train loaded with frozen turkeys — they say , at thanksgiving — from the meatpacking district .
so we exchanged business cards , and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization , friends of the high line .
mayor bloomberg came in office , he was very supportive , but we still had to make the economic case .
it 's been successful beyond our dreams .
and the whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the high line .
and this has been designed by renzo piano .
and honestly , even though i love the designs that we were building , i was always frightened that i would n't really love it , because i fell in love with that wildscape — and how could you recreate that magic ?
just one quick example is i realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the high line .
when i was 15 , i took an emt course , and i went to volunteer on an ambulance .
that second he declared this child dead .
`` `` '' i do n't need your help , '' '' he said . ''
he was on coumadin .
so i went ahead , full force — ( applause ) — and i started united hatzalah in east jerusalem , and that 's why the names united and hatzalah match so well .
could you imagine how i felt in that moment ?
and i think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project , you know .
i was a very creative kid who read a lot , and got into electronics first , and then later , programming computers , when i was really young .
and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff .
and so i think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with second life , and i think it 's important .
you know , to give you a size idea about scale , you know , comparing space to second life , most people do n't realize , kind of — and then this is just like the internet in the early '90s .
the space itself is about 10 times the size of san francisco , and it 's about as densely built out .
( applause ) john hockenberry : why is the creation , the impulse to create second life , not a utopian impulse ?
you have to have that level of freedom , and so i 'm often asked that , you know , is there a , kind of , utopian or , is there a utopian tendency to second life and things like it , that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it ?
we finally gave up , took it out of the code .
i mean , we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building .
and then the second one is — if they feel like it , and they 're not going to do it in every case , but in many they are — they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood .
that 's probably not very many .
and so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies .
( laughter ) pr : i was a — there were times i was a c student . you know , it 's funny .
i do n't think we can get away from those changes .
i think generally , we were talking about this — i think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it , being — surviving there , having a good life there , so to speak , is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it , because of the languages , because of the entrepreneurial richness of it , the sort of flea market nature , if you will , of the virtual world today .
( applause )
( beatboxing )
so there 's things you ca n't do , and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me , because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world , but they 're sketches at best , which is what 's annoyed me .
( applause ) but what if i wanted to sound like the whole of pink floyd ?
in order to tell the individual human stories here , i felt that i needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media .
`` i say the word `` '' costume '' '' because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone . ''
i became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves , this outward expression of masculinity , the ideal of the warrior .
snipers , loyal to the government , started firing on the civilians and protesters on institutskaya street .
the following day , president yanukovych fled ukraine .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
they 'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional american dream .
they sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior , to dream , to read , to work on music , art and writing .
( applause )
air flow ? no .
the doctor 's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying .
semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick , and he discovered that he 'd been autopsying a corpse .
so this brings me to the two ideas i want to talk about tonight .
betzig is a true rebel .
for this work , last year , eric betzig won the nobel prize .
he wanted movies .
so what did he do ?
those are actin molecules .
but he has n't shattered any cherished beliefs .
now , most scientists think he 's a crackpot .
( applause )
lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks , funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair , where commemorating someone who 's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition .
and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death .
but instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies , proximity to death , or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death , i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out .
these are called tau tau .
but the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased , and , by extension , the deceased 's family .
it 's said in toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life .
but in 1492 , the new world was discovered , horizons were expanding , and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well .
and it did , thanks to a creative genius , a visionary and an awesome story .
but genius rose to the challenge .
in an age when a man dared to sail across the atlantic ocean , michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters .
instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness , he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within .
julius was a man who envisioned a vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty , and he was right .
michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark , a churning figure blurry in the distance , compressed into a tight space .
and then michelangelo threw a curveball .
who is in that other arm ?
and as michelangelo proved in his painting , hardship , setbacks and obstacles , they do n't limit excellence , they forge it .
and so it did .
we are caught in that space between beginnings and endings , in the great , huge totality of the human experience .
bg : liz , grazie .
eh : nailed it .
( laughter ) ( applause ) eh : and we 're not even to the holy shit part . ( laughter )
( applause ) you 're inducted into the tv hall of fame on the first day that it exists .
a year later i asked my mother if i could have them , because i 'd like to keep them all the years of my life ...
it was a sunday morning , when i got a call from the fellow who ran the tv academy of arts & sciences .
nl : i call my mother immediately in hartford , connecticut .
but when he came back , they arrested him as he got off the plane .
so ...
`` and then i was crying , and then he said , `` and men of the house do n't cry . '' ''
when my father was away , i was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together , and i caught a signal that turned out to be father coughlin .
`` every letter started , `` my dearest , darling mr. president , '' and he 'd tell him something wonderful about what he did . ''
and , i mean , i stole arthur marshall 's grandfather and made him my own .
when i started to write the memoir and i started to think about it , and then i — i — i did a reasonable amount of crying , and i realized how much i needed the father .
`` i submerge that in the word `` '' rascal . '' '' eh : well there 's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal . ''
nl : i 'm a pro .
so you 're in good company .
`` and when i hear things like that — little things — because i know that there is n't anybody in this audience that was n't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody , whether it 's as little as a smile or an unexpected `` '' hello , '' '' that 's how little this thing was . ''
( laughter ) eh : so i have one more question for you .
now , there 's a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what 's going on .
and anyone who 's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable .
this is what happens in people who share half of their dna — fraternal twins .
that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts , and some of them can inhibit others .
in the book , i go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , chernobyls , third rails , and so on — including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , marxism , morality , nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
and needless to say , there were certain risks in taking on these subjects .
`` `` '' do n't expect to get any more awards , job offers or positions in scholarly societies . '' '' `` `` tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio . '' '' `` do you have tenure ? '' ''
but what i wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that the blank slate has received .
i 'll just put that list up for a few seconds , and see if you can guess which two — i would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews .
the telling of stories , music , dance , poetry — found in all cultures , and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies : a preference for symmetrical forms , the use of repetition and variation , even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world , you have lines that are very close to three seconds long , separated by pauses .
one of them is in elite art since the 1930s — say , the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras , where most of the repertory is before 1930 , or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums .
in literary criticism and analysis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , literary critics were a kind of cultural hero ; now they 're kind of a national joke .
they did n't ask me , but by their own admission , they need all the help that they can get .
and , as you can see , there — something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
wrong . identical twins , or any siblings , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together .
thank you very much .
